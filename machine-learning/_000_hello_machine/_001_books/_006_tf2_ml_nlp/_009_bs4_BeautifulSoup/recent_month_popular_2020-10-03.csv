     Mercedes-Benz's GLB, left, and GLA SUVs on the road. [MERCEDES-BENZ KOREA]               Everybody knows Mercedes-Benz has strong presence in Korea’s sedan market — particularly in its best-selling E-Class.           The premium German carmaker is vying for a similar level of dominance in the SUV market, with two recently launched models for Korean customers: The fully revamped GLA and the debuting GLB.           The GLA and GLB, categorized as compact SUVs, share the same platform and powertrain, making them siblings.             But they also differ drastically, both on the inside and out.             The Korea JoongAng Daily recently got a chance to compare the two SUVs, driving a 140-kilometer (87-mile) round trip to a cafe in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi.           First came the GLB 250 4MATIC. It was intriguing from first sight, as it looked nothing like Mercedes' other SUV lineup, known for having a fluid and more elegant line.           Instead, the GLB SUV was rather chunky, giving it a boxier and more angular demeanor.           As a fan of the car company’s sophisticated, flowy design language, this GLB SUV's exterior didn’t appeal to me as other models.           Taking a look at its interior, however, showed that this car's aesthetics were not at its foremost for its designers.           Despite it being a compact SUV, the GLB provided ample space in both the front and back rows, making it an adequate option for families.            Its wheelbase is 2,830 millimeters (111 inches), approximately 100 millimeters longer than the GLA's 2,729 millimeters, and falling just shy of that of the GLC in the company's larger lineup, at 2,875 millimeters. With the second row folded, this SUV has a luggage capacity of 1,805 liters (477 gallons).           Mercedes-Benz Korea said the seven-seater version will launch next year and will bolster its creds as family-friendly vehicle.           Once on the road, its handling wasn’t as smooth as expected. After all, it was a compact SUV, and the expectation was that it should be agile and quick. On an urban road, the vehicle's first impression left me with the hefty, rough feeling of driving an off-road-oriented SUV.           It wasn't until reaching the empty highway that this boxy SUV finally showed off its strong points. At high speeds, the vehicle was extremely stable, although noise from the ground and wind was easily audible. On winding or bumpy roads it felt like the vehicle was firmly gripping to the surface.           The carmaker said the GLB 250 4MATIC comes with an Off-Road Engineering Package that offers stronger control and additional information on the center display, such as the degree of the slope and the condition of the suspension. The test drive course did not include off-road routes, so I didn’t get to try this mode out. But this package seems to lack the endurance for the toughness of unpaved roads.           Its smaller sibling, the GLA 250 4MATIC, has actually been with Korean customers longer, as the company launched its previous version here last year.           It inherits the curving, elegant line of Mercedes-Benz’ SUV family but its swooping roofline and driving performance hews closer to a coupe-like demeanor.           The GLA provided a drastically sportier performance. The steering wheel was much smaller and the handling, therefore, was more responsive.           Its acceleration was quick and its handling was light — both of which were maintained at high speeds as well. The vehicle did, however, rock slightly when travelling in excess of 120 kilometers per hour.           Its backseat would feel a little cramped for some, but what was noticeable was the affluent headroom secured as the latest fully revamped version has gotten 110 millimeters taller.           The GLA 250 4MATIC’s price starts at 59.1 million won ($50,600). The GLB 250 4MATIC’s price starts at 61.1 million won.           The target customers were clearly different for the two SUVs. The GLB SUV is a more practical option for those who have more family members or friends to carry around. The GLA was more of a stylish option for those who will travel shorter distances and want to have some fun inside the city.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

     The official image for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls,"" the lead track of the group's first full-length album titled ""The Album"" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]                Sometimes it’s better to keep expectations low. But not when it comes to Blackpink – the band’s newest album is guaranteed to best anyone’s expectations, however high they may be.           “We put our heart and soul into the album,” said member Jennie during an online press conference held on Friday afternoon, an hour after the band’s first full-length album titled “The Album” was released at 1 p.m.           “This is our first new album in such a long time and we felt that a lot of people were waiting for us. We wanted to show everyone the best we could, especially because this is our first full-length album. So we took part in writing the music, all out of our wish to pay back the love we got.”           “The Album” is Blackpink’s first ever full-length album, which strikes as a surprise to K-pop fans, considering the band has stormed global music charts with just singles and EPs until now.                 Anticipation for the album had soared ever since the band’s agency YG Entertainment first shared the news of its drop earlier this year in spring, and the countdown began when the release date was set for today in July.           Preorders for “The Album” surpassed 1 million copies as of Friday, the highest number for any K-pop girl group so far. The 18,888 copies of the limited edition LP have also sold out, and the numbers are expected to go up even more until the day that sales for the hardcopies go on sale on Oct. 6, according to the agency. There are eight tracks on the album, including the singles that were released earlier this summer: “How You Like That” and “Ice Cream.”           “We’ve released a variety of music so far, but having the first full-length album is very meaningful in itself I think,” said Rose. “We were so excited when we first found out that we’ll be releasing it. We thought the songs that could go on the album and spent all our time in the studio. Some songs were taken out at the end, but I think the album is filled with a variety of genres such as hip-hop, R&B and dance that will be enough to let listeners have a good time.”           The lead track “Lovesick Girls” a first-time venture into a new genre of country folk that Blackpink has never set foot in before, but it does so without losing its iconic style, poise and flair. The song comes to an exhilarating apex in the refrain when the quartet sings its lines along with a backup chorus of voices, which was a style of music the band had shown beforehand with “Kill This Love” (2019), but with a more accomplished sound this time.           “We were younger girls when we first debuted [in 2016], but now we’ve grown,” said Jennie. “We have in ourselves the urge to run around free, and I think we got that across in the music video. I hope that after listening to the chorus, people would want to sing along and dance with us.”              The official image for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls,"" the lead track of the group's first full-length album titled ""The Album"" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]                The members of Blackpink took part in the writing process of the songs on “The Album” like never before. Members Jennie and Jisoo contributed to writing the lyrics of “Lovesick Girls” and Jennie helped writing the music along with producers Teddy, 24, Brian Lee, Leah Haywood, R.Tee and David Guetta.           “'Lovesick Girls’ is the story of everyone – all of us,” said Jisoo. “It has the factor that everyone can relate to I think. We all fall once, whether because of love or because of something else. But we find something to go on for and then we try again. That’s a story that we repeat in our lives, but it isn’t a sad song. It’s a song that carries a positive message that tells everyone to have hope.”           While the unexpected outbreak of the coronavirus may have kept the band from meeting fans in person, it hasn’t stopped them from collaborating with some of the world’s biggest music stars, like Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez and Cardi B. Blackpink was featured on Lady Gaga’s album released in May through the track “Sour Candy,” while Gomez lent her voice to the band’s single “Ice Cream,” which has been included as a track in “The Album.” Rapper Cardi B has been featured on track No. 4, titled “Bet You Wanna.”           “We grew up listening to their songs, so it’s just such an honor to be able to collaborate with them,” said Lisa.           Jennie added, “I feel like going back to when we were trainees and we were listening to their songs. It’s just so inspirational to be able to work together with them. And it makes us feel like we’re going on the right track, so it’s always so fulfilling to hear [people want to collaborate with us].”              The official image for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls,"" the lead track of the group's first full-length album titled ""The Album"" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]                Blackpink broke multiple records this year with its two pre-released singles “How You Like That” and “Ice Cream,” especially on YouTube, winning the nickname “YouTube Queens.” Its music videos for ""How You Like That"" hit 500 million views in the fastest time ever for a K-pop act and ""Ice Cream"" hit 200 million views on YouTube on Sept. 8. It was the fastest time for any K-pop act's music video to hit the 500 million-view mark, and also bested the group's own record of 111 days it had set with ""Kill This Love"" (2019) by almost 40 days. The band also surpassed DJ Marshmello to become the artist with the second-largest number of YouTube subscribers in the world.           “We’re honored to have that nickname,” said Rose. “We’re grateful that we get to accomplish everything with our music. We’re so happy that people related to our music in different ways, not just simply listening to them.”           After the coronavirus subsides, the first thing on the members’ minds is getting  on stage to meet with Blink, the official fan club, all over the world. But even before that, they have a variety of new content waiting for fans, such as the first ever Netflix documentary program “Blackpink: Light Up The Sky,” set to be released on Oct. 14.           “It’s sad to go on a stage without Blink,” said Lisa. “When everything gets safer, the first thing we want to do is tour. We miss Blink so much – especially outside of Korea. But we have something in store for Blink, so I hope you all look forward to that.”           BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "

     A screen shows the closing figure for the Kospi in a trading room at Hana Bank in Jung District, central Seoul, on Sept. 22. [YONHAP]                With the government planning to increase taxes on retail investors, Koreans are scrambling to offload their stocks in a bid to evade the new charges.           Under the revised enforcement ordinances of Korea's Income Tax Act, which is set to come into effect in April 2021, the government will collect taxes from individuals who own more than 300 million won ($256,000) in stocks of a single entity, or over 1 percent of the total shares. The tax will be set between 22 percent and 27.5 percent of gains on transfers, depending on the size of profits.            Until recently, only people who own 1 billion won of a single stock were obliged to pay the taxes, as they are categorized as a major shareholder. The government plans to add more retail investors to the category.            Regarding the sudden increase in taxes, retail investors are expressing frustration. Some are already selling off their shares to avoid the extra charge.           “When the average selling price of an apartment is Seoul is at about 1 billion won, how can a person who owns only 300 million won in shares be considered a ‘major shareholder?’” Lee Moon-sook, a 51-year-old retail investor, said. “I guess it’s time to sell off all my shares.”           The Korea Stockholders Alliance held a press conference in front of the government complex in Sejong on Sept. 25, voicing its opposition to the revision.           “[If the country’s revised law goes into effect,] many retail investors will have to suffer from a sharp decline in stock prices as more people sell their shares,” said a spokesperson from the alliance during the conference.           A Blue House petition gained over 95,000 signatures as of Sept. 27, expressing strong opposition to the law.           In a response, Rep. Kim Byung-wook of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) said in a Facebook post on Sunday that he will surely do something to “delay the enforcement decree.""           Kim also said the country should approach the issue from two major perspectives, emphasizing that “we should think about how we can move the money that is currently tied up in real estate to the stock market, as well as how we can overcome the so-called Korea discount.”             However, the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee has not indicated any plan to revise the law. According to a source from the DP, the party has not discussed postponing the law with the committee.             Experts say that the Ministry of Economy and Finance is not likely to revise the policy at this time when the country’s financial situation is getting worse due to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic as the law is a good chance to collect more taxes which will eventually help the economy.           “The Ministry of Economy and Finance is following the basic principle that ‘taxation must occur where income occurs’,” a source from the DP said. “However, the Financial Services Commission worries about the future of [the stock market] which will see a sharp decline [due to the revised law].”           BY CHEA SARAH, SHIM SAE-ROM AND IM JANG-HYUK   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

Right: Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals throws a pitch during Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park in San Diego on Wednesday. [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]                     The two Korean major league pitchers were hoping for another historic double win on Chuseok, but sadly that wasn’t to be.           Both Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals started in their respective MLB Wild Card Series games on Wednesday evening, or on Thursday morning in Korea. Following wins in both of their last games in the regular season, expectations were high.           The Blue Jays were first to start Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field in Florida on Wednesday, local time, or 5 a.m. in Korea. As the Blue Jays lost Game 1 3-1 to the Rays, Ryu took to the mound as the last chance for his team to stay in the postseason.           Despite a strong first season with the Blue Jays, Ryu wasn't able to manage this one last trick and the young team ended their postseason journey with an 8-2 loss in Game 2.            Ryu had his worst start yet in a Blue Jays uniform, leaving the mound after just one and two thirds of an inning having given up eight hits and seven runs.           Ryu started off shaky, giving up a run in the first inning, but the real trouble came in the second. After giving up a hit to Ray’s center fielder Kevin Kiemaier, Ryu gave up a two-run homer to catcher Mike Zunino to allow the Rays to extend their lead.           With just one out, Ryu allowed designated hitter Randy Arozarena to hit a double, and at two outs, Ryu gave up a walk to third baseman Yandy Diaz. With two runners on base, Ryu was desperately looking for an inning-ending out, but a fielding error from Blue Jays' shortstop Bo Bichette allowed the Rays to load the bases.           That's when the unthinkable happened — Rays' right fielder Hunter Renfroe delivered with a clutch grand slam to give the Rays a 7-0 and end Ryu's night early.            Once Ryu left the game, the Blue Jays attempted to catch up with runs at the top of the third and fifth, but that was never going to enough to cut into the deficit.           The Blue Jays had advanced to the postseason for the first time in four years this year, but that journey will end after being swept out of the Wild Card Series.           Of the seven runs, three counted as earned runs throughout Ryu’s short stint on the mound in Game 2. This was by far the worst start for Ryu this year as he picked up a loss and had a 16.20 ERA.           While the Blue Jays postseason collapse was bad news for Ryu, it's great news for one of the only other Koreans in the MLB playoffs — Rays' slugger Choi Ji-man. It was unclear whether Choi would appear in the Wild Card Series as he's been out for a few weeks with a hamstring injury, but he did manage to make it into the batting box as a pinch hitter.            Although he left the game with a .000 batting average, Choi's appearance suggests that he will be fit to play later in the postseason.           While Ryu suffered a loss and the Blue Jays are headed home, the Cardinals started their Wilds Card Series with a win in Game 1 against the San Diego Padres.           Although the Cardinals picked up a win, Kim’s start was also a disappointment.           Making his first-ever postseason start in the major league, Kim also wasn’t able to fulfill the regulated innings to be eligible for a win as he was lifted from the mound after three and two thirds of an inning.           Kim gave up three runs off two walks and five hits before being pulled from the mound.           As the Cardinals got off to a strong start by scoring four runs in the first inning, Kim headed onto the mound with plenty of run support. Although Kim never gave up that lead, he did give up a run in every inning.           Thanks to the Cardinals’ strong batting lineup, by the time Kim was pulled off the mound the team had a comfortable 6-3 lead.           With Kim out the game, the Cardinals allowed the Padres another run to finish the game 7-4, winning Game 1.           Although Kim had a no decision, this was his worst start of the season as he gave up three runs and five hits, while striking out two with a 7.36 ERA.           With the Cardinals taking a 1-0 lead in the Wild Card Series, they’ll continue the series in Game 2 on Thursday, local time, or Friday at 6:08 a.m. in Korea, at Petco Park in San Diego.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

     A poster introducing a new service by CJ Foodville’s Season’s Table. [CJ FOODVILLE]                With their popularity in a free fall amid the pandemic, buffet restaurants are now trying to claw their way back to profitability by abandoning buffets.           The companies are increasingly shifting to standard restaurant formats or focusing on takeout and delivery orders to keep themselves afloat.           CJ Foodville’s Season’s Table abandoned its buffet completely and started serving food instead. Instead of the variety of foods that buffets usually offer, consumers can choose from one out of its eight menus that can be ordered through a QR code. The company started test-operating the service on Tuesday at its four branches.           “We introduced this service considering the safety of customers’ eating-out culture,” a spokesperson for CJ Foodville said. “We will continuously try to come up with a new eating culture.”           Elandeats’ premium buffet chain Ashley is still offering a variety of dishes in unlimited quantities, but isn't allowing customers to serve themselves. Patrons instead choose what they want at their tables, and employees immediately serve them. Ashley has been operating this service since Sept. 25.             Seafood buffet Viking’s Wharf also changed its system to make their employees to serve its unlimited food to customers.           Hotels are also following the trend. Lotte Hotel Seoul has been running a “Private Gourmet” service in its buffet restaurant La Seine since Sept. 18. Customers can choose up to 70 food items in advance and employees serve them unlimited quantities. The hotel reduced its available seats by 40 percent amid the pandemic.           “We introduced a new service so that customers to La Seine can enjoy eating safely while following the government’s social distancing guidelines,” said a spokesperson for Lotte Hotel Seoul.           The Parkview, The Hotel Shilla’s buffet restaurant, is no longer a buffet anymore. Instead, they offer a full course meal consisting of the restaurant’s signature menus, including crabs and lamb chops.              A banner explains Ashley’s new ’Ashely Home Dining“ service that allows customers to order food through the delivery app Baedal Minjok. [ELANDEATS]               In September, Ashley began operating “Ashley Home Dining,” allowing customers to order their food through the delivery app Baedal Minjok.          Makino Chaya, LF Food’s seafood buffet restaurant, had launched Chuseok gift sets consisting of their popular food items. The sets were available in two options: the “Jesa ceremony pack” which included namul (seasonal vegetables) and grilled croaker; and the “Chuseok party pack” which contained japchae (stir-fried noodles mixed with vegetables) and jeon (Korean pancake). Customers who placed orders through their phones were able to pick up their gift sets at the restaurant’s branches in Yeoksam-dong, southern Seoul, Pangyo, Gyeonggi, and Gwanggyo, Suwon.             “Buffet restaurants in Korea expected to see a long-term struggle from the second wave of Covid-19,” Seo Yong-gu, a professor of business administration at Sookmyung Women’s University, said. “They have been offering delivery and takeout services temporarily or even changing their operating systems in order to survive.”           BY BAE JUNG-WON   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Doosan Infracore’s excavator, which is being supplied to a construction company in Saudi Arabia. [DOOSAN INFRACORE]               Ever since the Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year, Doosan Group has been busy trying to sell off assets to improve its financial structure.           Among the latest selloffs is Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction’s shares in Doosan Infracore, a leading construction heavy equipment maker in Korea.             The preliminary bidding took place on Sept. 28.           Hyundai Heavy Industries Group, private equity fund MBK Partners and investment company Glenwood Private Equity were among the bidders attempting to purchase the 36 percent stake Doosan Heavy holds in Doosan Infracore.           Doosan group could not confirm the date the final bidder would be selected, but market watchers project Hyundai Heavy to be one of the strongest candidates due to the synergy effect it could generate with its subsidiary Hyundai Construction Equipment.           The country’s No.2 construction equipment maker is 33.12 percent controlled by Hyundai Heavy Industries Group.               Uncertainties      In early August, Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings denied reports that it is considering a takeover of Doosan Infracore. But its stance changed after Doosan Group said that it will repay any additional debts of Doosan Infracore’s Chinese unit.           Currently, Doosan Infracore is in a legal battle with its financial investors.           In 2011, a group of financial investors, including Mirae Asset Global Investment Private Equity, acquired a 20 percent stake in Doosan Infracore China on the condition they retrieve the investment after the Chinese unit goes public within three years. Doosan Infracore China couldn’t go public, and the financial investors tried to sell their shares in the company without success. They filed a lawsuit against Doosan Infracore, saying that the company didn’t cooperate in efforts to sell the shares.           The investors are currently waiting for a Supreme Court decision. In the appeals trial, the court took the side of the financial investors. If the ruling isn’t overturned, Doosan Infracore could face up to 700 billion won ($598.44 million) worth of debt, which is the total amount of investment the investors injected plus the interest that has piled up over the years since the issue was taken to court.           But now that Doosan Group has promised to be responsible for the consequences of the legal battle, the value of Doosan Infracore has risen. The initial date for preliminary bidding was Sept. 22, but Credit Suisse, which arranged the deal, pushed the date to Sept. 28 after Doosan Group made the announcement due to a possible change in value.           The price of Doosan Heavy’s shares in Doosan Infracore is now estimated at between 800 billion won and a trillion won.               Synergy effect      Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings took part in the bidding in a consortium with KDB Investment, a subsidiary of the state-run Korean Development Bank.             The consortium is seen as a major candidate in the bidding due to the synergy effect that can be generated between Doosan Infracore and Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings’ subsidiary Hyundai Construction Equipment.             Following the acquisition, Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings is projected to become the world’s fifth largest construction equipment manufacturer. In 2018, Doosan Infracore’s global market share for construction equipment accounted for 3.7 percent, ranking ninth, while Hyundai Construction Equipment stood at 20th with 1.5 percent market share.           “Hyundai Construction Equipment will be able to generate a synergy effect through the acquisition because it can secure Doosan Infracore’s supply and distribution networks and share technologies,” said analyst Lee Dong-heon from Daishin Securities. “Securing the networks and technologies has become particularly important due to the intensified competition from competitors in the Chinese market.”           China is one of Doosan Infracore’s largest markets.           But the exclusion of Doosan Bobcat, another construction equipment maker under Doosan Group, from the acquisition deal could be seen as a factor that reduces the value of the deal.           Doosan Bobcat, which is 51.05 percent owned by Doosan Infracore, reported $52.44 million in operating profit in the first half of this year on $788.47 million in sales.             In the second quarter, Doosan Bobcat accounted for 48 percent of Doosan Infracore’s total sales, which stood at 1.98 trillion won.           Following the sales of Doosan Infracore shares, Doosan Group is likely able to raise 3 trillion won. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, its creditors — Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Korea — have injected 3.6 trillion won into Doosan Heavy.           Doosan group is unloading other core assets, including Doosan Tower and Doosan Solus, an electronics parts maker.             BY JIN MIN-JI  [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]               Related ArticleDoosan Tower sells for 800 billion won as financial woes continueDoosan Heavy plans to issue $1.1B in new stockDoosan Bobcat to manufacture small excavators in ChinaDoosan Heavy received key certification for 3D printingDoosan Infracore's excavator sales in China up 10%"

     In this file photo, a North Korean patrol boat is observed near the North's Daesuap Island from the South's Yeonpyeong Island on June 21, 2020. [YONHAP]               South Korea was listening in on North Korean military communications when the regime ordered its soldiers to shoot and kill a missing fisheries official found at sea but did nothing, sources from the National Assembly said Tuesday.             According to the sources from the National Assembly's National Defense Committee and Intelligence Committee, the military was eavesdropping on North Korean communications on Sept. 22. Around 3:30 p.m., the North discovered a South Korean civil servant floating in its waters. The man, surnamed Lee, went missing the previous day while on an inspection at sea.             ""We did not announce it because of concerns about our relations with North Korea, but we wiretap and eavesdrop on the North's communications in real time,"" a source from the National Defense Committee told the JoongAng Ilbo. ""We eavesdropped on the communication that a [North Korean patrol boat] was reporting to the Naval Command.""           According to the sources, a written report was sent to President Moon Jae-in around 6:36 p.m. on Sept. 22 that the missing Lee had been captured by the North Korean military.           The North's Naval Command issued an order to the soldiers after 9 p.m. to open fire to kill the man, the sources said, based on the eavesdropped communications.           In an interview with TBS Radio Tuesday morning, Rep. Min Hong-chul of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), who is chairman of the National Defense Committee, admitted that the South Korean military was listening to the North's communications.           ""[The patrol boat that found Lee] asked its upper chain of command what it should do with him,"" Min said. ""During this course of reporting, an order was issued to open fire at him. I was briefed that a speedboat came and shot him.""           Later in the day, Yonhap News Agency reported some details of the eavesdropped communications, quoting sources in the National Assembly. ""I want to confirm it again,"" a North Korean captain asked the command, the sources told Yonhap. ""Shoot and kill? Is this real?""           Min, however, told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday that he did not want to confirm the report.           A source from the Intelligence Committee said soldiers on the North Korean patrol boat were debating whether or not they were ordered to shoot and kill Lee. ""It is true that there was such a dialogue,"" he said.           Another source from the National Defense Committee also told the JoongAng Ilbo that the North Korean soldiers had discussed the shoot-and-kill order.           According to the sources, the military heard the North Korean patrol boat reporting to its chain of command that the man was shot and killed around 9:40 p.m.           ""Before Lee was killed, the military should have made efforts through the United Nations to repatriate him,"" a source from the National Defense Committee said.           The military spent nearly an hour before informing the Blue House around 10:30 p.m. of Lee's fatal shooting. Concerned ministers held an emergency meeting at 1 a.m. on Sept. 23, and President Moon was briefed about the situation at 8:30 a.m.             The South Korean military also confirmed through the eavesdropped communications that Lee apparently had a conversation with North Koreans nearby, which contradicts North Korea's assertion to the South on Friday that it only talked to him from about 80 meters (260 feet) away.             The eavesdropped communications showed that Lee told the North that he wanted to defect, suggesting that the two sides had a conversation at a relatively close distance. Experts have said having a dialogue at sea about 80 meters away is difficult due to the sound of waves and the North Korean ship's engine noise.             According to the eavesdropped communications, the North Korean soldiers initially had the intention of rescuing Lee.       The source said North Korean soldiers first used a rope to tow Lee, who was reportedly wearing a life jacket and was on a floating object, to land. They, however, lost him in the waters.             After two hours searching, they discovered Lee again and held onto him. The situation, however, changed around 9 p.m. when the Naval Command ordered them to shoot and kill him.           Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense denied that it had detected intelligence about the North's order to shoot and kill Lee. The Blue House also denied that it was eavesdropping on the North's communications.           BY HAN YOUNG-IK, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
9,"<h1 class=""view-article-title serif"">Google Play puts squeeze on app developers</h1>","

     [REUTERS]               Korean IT companies are furious over Google’s Monday announcement that it would collect a 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases in applications downloaded from its Play Store starting early next year.           Game apps have been required to use Google Play’s in-app payment system for in-app purchases by gamers, and Google took a 30 percent commission. Now that applies to apps in all categories including e-book, webtoon, music, video streaming and subscription services. Those apps did not have to use Google's payment system and could use others, such as credit cards.           The official implementation date of the policy is Jan. 20, but apps that are already doing business with Google have an extension until Sept. 30, 2021.           Google clarified that developers can always take payments through their official websites, which would not incur the 30 percent commission, but would be far less convenient.           In an online press briefing Tuesday, Google explained to local media that the billing policy is necessary to re-invest in the platform and that it offers a “safe, reliable” payment system that benefits both users and developers.           Apple already requires apps sold in its App Store to use its payment system and surrender a 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases.           Google’s policy change means a lot to Korean IT services as it runs the largest app store in the country. Google Play has a 63.4 percent market share in Korea. Korean consumers paid 5.9 trillion won ($5 billion) through Google Play’s payment system last year, according to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association (Moiba). Apple took a 25 percent market share last year, and One Store, a domestic service, accounted for around 10 percent.           Google said Tuesday that 99 percent of Korean apps will not be affected by the in-app purchases policy, considering that many mobile apps don't offer in-app purchases.           “To say the impact is small because only 1 percent is affected — that’s just playing with numbers,” said Kim Jae-hwan, policy bureau director at the Korea Internet Corporations Association, or K-Internet, a nonprofit organization that represents domestic IT firms. “That 1 percent was equivalent to nearly 6 trillion won,"" he added, referring to Moiba's data.           According to Kim, many local apps that make revenue through in-app purchases are distributors of content such as e-books, webtoons and videos. Setting aside copyright fees paid to the original creator and costs, these start-ups take 20 to 30 percent of revenue as profit. Paying a 30 percent commission to Google leaves them with almost nothing, he said.           Industry analysts say the burden could eventually be passed on to consumers in the form of price hikes. For some services, customers already pay a different price depending on their device. At Naver Webtoon, for example, one cookie — the token needed to purchase cartoon episodes — costs 100 won on Android devices but 120 won on Apple devices.           Following media reports in July that Google had contacted local IT firms about plans to change the in-app purchases policy, Korea’s IT and start-up industry has been lobbying policymakers to stop the action.           After Google’s announcement, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) announced Tuesday it was starting an investigation into whether the policy change violates the Telecommunications Business Act.           “Unlike Apple, which implemented this policy from the start, Google is making a change after acquiring market dominance based on its open source policy,” Korea Communications Commission Chair Han Sang-hyuk said in a National Assembly meeting on Sept. 2, where he hinted at the possibility of looking into Google’s actions.           As of mid-September, there were three bills submitted for review to the National Assembly that would make reforms to the Telecommunications Business law that would stop app markets from forcing their in-app payment system on app developers.    It’s questionable how effective domestic law would be in stopping Google from implementing a global policy.           “The same issue had been raised with Apple since the early 2000s and yet there was no proper investigation,"" said Choi Sung-jin, executive board director of the Korea Startup Forum, at a Sept. 21 conference. ""This time, regulators should suggest a clear stance.           “Even if they fail to stop [foreign app store operators], they need to make clear that such actions go against the fair trade law or the Telecommunications Business Act. I believe their murky attitude sent a wrong signal to the market that such actions are acceptable.”           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Cars line the Gyeongbu Expressway Tuesday, a day ahead of the five-day Chuseok holiday, in an image captured from a police helicopter. [YONHAP]               Health authorities urged travelers to take extra precautions as over 2 million people are expected to hit the road on the five-day Chuseok holiday, even though Korea’s new coronavirus cases dropped to below 50 Tuesday for the first time since early August.           The country kept new cases in the double digits for the fifth consecutive day, adding 38 Covid-19 patients, of which 23 were local infections and 15 imported, as of Monday midnight, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).           This was the lowest number of cases in 49 days, since the country recorded 34 cases on Aug. 11. That was right before a spike in cases especially in the Seoul metropolitan area after new clusters emerged from a church in Seongbuk District and an antigovernment rally downtown on Liberation Day on Aug. 15.             Korea recorded a total of 23,699 Covid-19 cases, with one additional death reported, according to the KDCA Tuesday, raising the death toll to 407, with a fatality rate of 1.72 percent.           There were 11 new cases in Seoul and six in Gyeonggi, the first time since Aug. 11 that daily infections in the metropolitan area dropped below 20. Three cases were in Busan and two in North Gyeongsang.                      Despite recent coronavirus figures showing a downward trend, Second Vice Health Minister Kang Do-tae said Tuesday, “We urge the people to continue to remain vigilant so that the Chuseok holiday does not become a catalyst for a nationwide spread of Covid-19.”           The government continues to maintain Level 2 in its three-tier social distancing scheme but has also introduced some tailored precautionary measures for the holidays.           The Korea Expressway Corporation said that all indoors seating at expressway rest stops will be shut for six days from Tuesday to Sunday as a part of enhanced social distancing measures.           Restaurants at all expressway rest stops will be prohibited from serving food and only be allowed to provide take-out service to visitors, who will be encouraged to eat in their cars. Travelers will also be required to log in with mobile phone numbers when they drop by.           Travelers will not be exempted from expressway tolls from Wednesday to Friday, as they have been on previous national holidays, a move by the government to dissuade people from traveling.             The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport estimates that the number of people return to their hometowns this year will shrink to 2.759 million travelers, or 30 percent less than 2019.           The Transport Ministry estimates that 91.4 percent of travelers will be taking private vehicles, 5.7 percent buses and 1.9 percent trains.           More traffic was expected on the highways this year travelers choose to drive as opposed to taking public transportation.

     Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the People Power Party (PPP), speaks at the videoconference meeting of the party's lawmakers on Tuesday. [YONHAP]                The main opposition party on Tuesday said it will file an appeal to the high prosecutors' office to challenge the district prosecutors' decision to clear Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae of allegations she abused her power to seek favors for her son.            The People Power Party (PPP) also said it will push forward an independent counsel investigation to probe allegations that Choo's son had received special treatment when he was serving the military.           ""It is not enough to say that the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office had done a poor job in its probe into Choo's son,"" said Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the PPP. ""We think the prosecutors conspired with and assisted Choo to cover up suspicions. As soon as we obtain a report on why they were not indicted, we will challenge the decision.""           ""There is a legal way to challenge the district prosecutors' decision by filing an appeal to the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office, so we will invoke the process,"" Joo said. ""At the same time, we will introduce a bill to appoint an independent counsel.""           After an eight-month probe, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office announced Monday that it found no grounds on which to indict Choo, her son surnamed Seo and her former aide on allegations that Seo had been let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of his sick leave in June 2017. His leave at the time had already been extended once. Choo was accused of using her influence to get a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days.           Seo served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, from November 2016 through August 2018. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).           Joo also criticized the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office for trying to minimize public attention on the case.           ""The people are paying attention to the North's killing of a South Korean public servant and the media are quiet as the Chuseok holidays are about to begin,"" Joo said.

She also received a reply from her aide on how he had handled the extension of Seo's leave.           Their communication appeared to be at odds with Choo's repeated remarks in the National Assembly that she had never ordered her aide to ask the military to extend her son's leave.           ""Why would my aide to take an order for my personal matter?"" Choo said when she attended the National Assembly's Special Committee on Budget and Accounts on Sept. 1.           During a National Assembly hearing on Sept. 14, Choo said, ""I have never made an order.""           Despite the messages, the prosecution said it will not indict Choo because she only received reports from her aide without explicitly ordering him to extend her son's leave.           Meanwhile, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office will continue its investigation into other suspicions surrounding Seo's military service.           Suspicions were raised that improper pressure was applied to assign Seo to the Yongsan Garrison after he finished boot camp, and to select him as a military interpreter for 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

Our analysis concludes there’s also a very little possibility for the merger to push product prices,” the FTC wrote in a statement Tuesday.           Instead, the antitrust watchdog projected the merger will provide grounds to boost healthy competition in the ice cream market and help the two companies normalize businesses.           Korea’s ice cream market has been constantly shrinking.

17,"<h1 class=""view-article-title serif"">Fisheries official was defecting, says Coast Guard</h1>","

     Yoon Sung-hyun, chief of investigation and intelligence at the Coast Guard, gives a briefing Tuesday to reporters on a South Korean fisheries official's shooting death last week. [YONHAP]                A fisheries official who went missing near the maritime border last Monday before being shot and killed by North Korean soldiers last Tuesday, clearly made efforts to move northward against southward currents, the Coast Guard said, in order to defect to the North.           The Coast Guard held a press conference Tuesday morning to announce the conclusion of its investigation so far into the shooting death of the 47-year-old employee of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service. The victim, surnamed Lee, went missing on Sept. 21 in waters south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea. He was shot and killed by North Korean soldiers north of the NLL on Sept. 22.           Exactly how and why Lee ended up in the North has been a mystery, though Seoul military officials said last week they strongly believed he tried to defect to the North, which his family adamantly denies.           According to Yoon Sung-hyun, chief of investigation and intelligence at the Coast Guard, the agency concluded that Lee was trying to defect to the North based on military intelligence and a study projecting his expected movement in the waters.           Because Lee was wearing a life jacket, the Coast Guard believes it is unlikely he accidentally fell into the water or was attempting suicide, Yoon said.           “Our investigators visited the Ministry of National Defense yesterday to confirm some details,” Yoon said. “When an exhausted Lee was found in the North, he was wearing a life jacket and holding onto a floating object.           “According to the military, the North knew some specifics of Lee’s personal information such as his name, age, hometown and height,” Yoon said. “We also confirmed circumstances that Lee had told the North his intention to defect.”           It was unclear how the military became aware of anything Lee may have told the North. The Defense Ministry did not share the information with the Coast Guard.           The Coast Guard’s conclusion differs from details in a recent message from North Korea. Last week, the North told the South that it approached an “illegal intruder” and tried to confirm his identity, but he gave ambiguous responses. The North said Lee was trying to escape after its soldiers fired blanks at him, so it had to open fire.           Although the South’s military said the North burned Lee's body, the North said it only burned a floating object Lee was on, claiming that his body was not discovered.           The Coast Guard also said Tuesday scientific studies back its conclusion that Lee was trying to defect.           Based on studies of four research institutes including the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, Lee, if he was accidentally set adrift, should have floated in a southwestern direction, Yoon said. Lee, however, was shot and killed in North Korean waters about 38 kilometers (24 miles) northwest of where he went missing.             The Coast Guard said it conducted an experiment by using an object similar to Lee’s height of 180 centimeters (5 feet, 11 inches) and weight of 72 kilograms (159 pounds). The object was dropped in waters near Soyeonpyeong Island, where Lee went missing, and its movement was similar to the studies.           “There is a significant difference between our adrift course projection and the actual location where Lee was discovered,” Yoon said. “Without man-made efforts, it is impossible for him to have actually drifted to this location.”           Experts said a man in stable health, assisted by a life jacket and a floating object, is capable of swimming to the location in the northern waters, Yoon said.           “Lee graduated from a fisheries school,” a Coast Guard official said. “He was working on a fisheries inspection ship for nearly 10 years and he knew very well about the waters near Yeonpyeong Island. Based on the findings so far, we believe he was trying to defect to the North.           “Lee had a total of 330 million won [$282,000] in debt,” the official said, “and 268 million won was from online gambling. But we should not jump to the conclusion that he wanted to defect to the North because of the debts.”           The Coast Guard said it will continue forensic investigation of the boat Mugunghwa 10, from which Lee went missing, and question his associates.           While the Coast Guard concluded in the morning that Lee was killed while making an attempt to defect to North Korea, his family held a press conference in the afternoon to refute the notion.              Lee Rae-jin, elder brother of the victim, holds a press conference at the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club on Tuesday to denounce the Moon Jae-in administration for having failed to rescue his brother.  [YONHAP]                Lee’s elder brother, Lee Rae-jin, said the Moon Jae-in administration had two windows of opportunities to rescue the victim.             “After my brother went missing and was adrift in the waters for 30 hours, the government and the military did nothing to find and rescue him,” Lee said. “He ended up crossing the NLL into the North. Although there was time before his death, the military made no effort to save him as it was observing the situation for six hours.           “Although the military said it had no emergency contact with the North, the North Korean military broadcast warnings when my brother reached close to the NLL,” Lee said. “The South Korean military immediately aired its response. What is the truth?”           Lee also said his brother had no reason to defect because he had a solid career as a fisheries official. “My brother must have had faith that his country and his brother would rescue him,” Lee said. “I am ashamed that we failed him.”           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

The exclusive event for VVIP customers will be held at the Banyan Tree Club and Spa Seoul in Jung District of central Seoul from Oct. 14 to 19.             The new rollable TV has a 65-inch display, offers 4K picture quality and comes with a rectangular speaker. The display has three modes: full view; ""line view,"" for displaying time, music and photographs; and ""zero view,"" in which the television slides down into the sound speaker box upon a click of the remote control. Local media have reported that the estimated price is 100 million won ($85,600), about twice as expensive as LG's 8K OLED TV, which has an 88-inch display.           The company said the product is notable for its paper-thin screen and innovative technology that allows the television to take up minimal space at homes, unlike conventional televisions. The flexible characteristics of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) allow the TV to roll up and down.           LG showcased the world’s first rollable TV during the CES in 2019, and the product was originally supposed to go on sale that same year.
