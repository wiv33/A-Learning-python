2,"[TEST DRIVE] New BMW 5 Series packs a punch, but expect a bossy copilot","

     BMW's face-lifted 5 Series on display at a cafe in Gwangju, Gyeonggi, on Oct. 5. [BMW KOREA]               GWANGJU, Gyeonggi — With nobody touching the steering wheel, the face-lifted BMW 6 Series reversed out of a narrow alleyway, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake. The steering wheel spun to the right and left on its own as it drove backward.           Dubbed the Reversing Assistant, this driving assistant technology is newly installed in all trims of the face-lifted 5 and 6 Series launched in Korea on Oct. 5.           It could come in handy for novice drivers when confronted with Seoul's narrow, winding, occasionally dead-end streets.           BMW Korea held a media test drive session on Oct. 5, roughly five months after the German carmaker held the world premiere for the two face-lifted models in Korea, a first for any import carmaker.           Korea is one of the biggest markets for the 5 Series, having sold 77,000 units of its seventh generation model over the past four years as of August.           Between January and August, Korea was the biggest market in the world for the model, with 14,133 units bought, according to the carmaker.              The facelifted 6 Series on the road. [BMW KOREA]               The Korea JoongAng Daily got to test out the gasoline-powered 540i xDrive M Sport on Monday.           The sporty car excelled in offering a dynamic driving performance without jeopardizing its stability at speed. The vehicle responded immediately to the accelerator, jumping off the line to easily exceed speeds of 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour.           Under speeds of 140 kilometers per hour, the car is able to cruise on its own using its Driving Assistant Professional, which pretty much offers the same partially autonomous driving features available on other models, such as keeping its distance from the car in front and staying within the lanes.           When the function is turned on, the digital cluster behind the steering wheel provides a 3-D graphic of nearby roads and vehicles.           What differs from other models is that its lane keeping assistant — which is a default function that activates even without the Driving Assistant Professional system turned on — actively engages with the driving. When this reporter tried to change lanes on an empty road without turning on the signal, the vehicle jacked back the steering wheel, trying to keep the car in lane.           Its driving interventions did not stop there.           When the vehicle was exceeding the speed limit, the internal navigation system repeatedly ordered the driver to slow down, while other cars usually offer gentler warnings or suggestions.           The 630i xDrive GT M Sport provides a similar level of driving assistant technology to the 5 Series, while its driving performance was heavier and more elegant, although it lacked that powerful thrust at the start.           The 5 Series comes in five types of gasoline engines, two types of diesel engine topped with a 48-volt electrical system and one plug-in hybrid.           The base trim of the 520i model starts at 63.6 million won ($55,200) with a maximum horsepower of 184 and torque of 29.6 kilogram-meters.              The facelifted 5 Series on road. [BMW KOREA]               The 6 Series comes in three types of diesel engines and two types of gasoline engines.

3,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Transport gets personal as commuters try to avoid infection,"

                                    There can't be many cities with more comprehensive public transport than Seoul.           Buses and subways travel to every nook and cranny of the city and are well-managed and affordable.           But when you add a pandemic to the picture, things get a lot more difficult.           Having a bus stop on every street corner and jam-packed subway trains crisscrossing the city went from the gold standard of good city planning to a potential hotbed of contagion practically overnight. When Covid-19 became a nationwide issue in February, people quickly turned their backs on public transportation.           According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the operator of the majority of subway lines and buses in Seoul, the number of subway journeys fell to 139 million in March, a 40.3 percent drop from the year before when 233 million trips were taken.           In January, when the virus was still confined to China, the number exceeded 207 million. Up until August, subway usage had still not recovered, with 152 million rides.           Instead, demand for other mobility services shows a significant increase, and the way people use car-sharing and rental services has also changed.           “The pandemic will provide momentum for mobility services to grow as people who didn’t think about them in the past with such effective public transportation began to open their eyes to see what other options are actually out there,” said Kim Pil-soo, an automotive engineering professor at Daelim University.                     Subscriptions on the rise                       The pandemic gave a boost to car subscription services, long deemed unlikely to gain a foothold in Korea.           Mobility subscription services allow users to pick and choose the car they want under a certain membership. The more expensive the membership is, the more luxurious and varied the model options get.           ""Before the pandemic, subscription services for vehicles didn't get much spotlight,"" Kim said.           ""Ownership of vehicles was still considered a sign of wealth and such subscription services didn't serve that purpose.""           Covid-19, however, increased demand for private vehicles where there is no danger of being in contact with somebody else, but not everybody had the financial means to go out and buy a car right away.           Hyundai Motor, the No. 1 carmaker in Korea, said the number of new members to its flagship subscription program called Hyundai Selection recorded a 615 percent jump in April compared to the month before, going from 39 to 279.           The expansion of subscribers was similar for the Kia Flex subscription program operated by its affiliate Kia Motors.           Hyundai Selection’s monthly fee ranges from 590,000 won ($510) to 990,000 won, which gives the users the choice of two to seven models from the carmaker. A single membership can even be shared with other people, which drags down the monthly fee even further.           Responding to the rising demand, Hyundai Motor expanded its service in April and June, adding to its lineup and including vouchers for electric scooters and taxis.           ""Although a minor part within Hyundai Motor's business, the fledgling mobility service with its potential could be valued at 16.2 billion won,"" said Kim Gwi-yeon, an analyst at Heungkuk Securities.           ""The subscription program greatly drops the initial cost of owning a car compared to purchasing a car such as consumption tax, and you don't have to worry about insurance fees as well, which are included in the subscription fee.""           A similar trend was spotted in the rising popularity of Socar, the car-sharing start-up with the highest number of clients in the country.           Its Socar Pass subscription program had garnered 300,000 subscribers as of September, collecting half of its members in the six months since March.           The program allows users to drive vehicles from the Socar fleet at a discounted price with certain subscription fees.           For example, at a monthly fee of 14,900 won, subscribers can drive 12,000 vehicles from the Socar fleet as much as they want at 50 percent discounted prices.           Changing patterns have been spotted in the way people consume existing services, such as regular car-sharing programs or legacy rental car services.           Socar, which provides cars for a minimum of 30 minutes and charges for every additional 10 minutes, says the average time people borrow cars for has increased greatly since the outbreak of the coronavirus.           Customers drove the car at an average of 6.25 hours per week in March last year, but the figure rose to 8.5 hours per week this year.           ""As people seek more personal mobility, the average amount of time people drive has increased, going from a short-distance drive to a longer one,"" said Jeon Ji-soo, a public relations manager at the car-sharing start-up.           ""Switching cars frequently will also expose them to the risk of being infected.""           According to Socar's analysis, people starting their journeys from the greater Seoul area and traveling to Gangwon, one of the most popular vacation sites in Korea, accounted for 44.9 percent of the Socar fleet in May, 11.5 percentage points more than the same period last year.           On the other hand, people who just used Socar vehicles to travel within the region, which means they traveled there through other means such as KTX or buses, dropped to 51 percent, down from 62.9 percent last year.              Socar Plan, a subscription service of car-sharing platform Socar, is seeking new customers at an accelerated pace.

[OLULO]               Just a year ago, micromobility solutions represented by electric scooters and bikes were newfangled devices that might be fun to try out in the park, but certainly not legitimate means of getting from A to B.           In the Covid-19 era, however, when people are looking for affordable and solitary transportation options, these micromobility solutions have become increasingly popular.           ""I don't have a driving license, but I didn't want to get on the hectic subway line No. 9 where you literally and unavoidably have to come in physical contact with multiple passengers at commuting times,"" said Kim Hyun-joo, an office worker who has to commute 40 minutes to work by subway every morning.           ""I started riding Ttareungyi [a public bike rental service run by Seoul city] in the busiest zone, and surprisingly it was quite nice. I also ride electric scooters when I have to go to the supermarkets instead of riding buses. I don't think I will go back to riding the subway as much as I used to now that I realize that it is possible to take other means to the office. If it weren't for the coronavirus, I don't think I would have bothered to try it out in the first place.""           Olulo, the operator of electric scooter platform Kickgoing, saw the number of members of its service grow at an accelerated pace after the coronavirus broke out. The mobility company started the electric scooter platform in September 2018 and had gained 450,000 users as of January 2020. It added 150,000 new users in the first five months this year and another 300,000 users over the next five months.           ""Electric scooters come in handy to ride that 'last mile' from the station to the doorstep of your house,"" said Park Yeo-jin, a public relations manager at Olulo.           ""With the coronavirus, it was also highlighted because it is a personal mobility solution where you don't need to come in contact with anybody.""           A similar trend is also visible in the use of bicycles — electric or otherwise.           Kakao Mobility, a subsidiary under Kakao that handles mobility services such as taxis, bicycles and navigation, says people who ride on their electric Kakao T bikes rose exponentially after the outbreak of Covid-19 in March.           It says the number of journeys per bike between April and July rose by 27 percent on year on average per month.             ""What people need translated into new types of demand,"" wrote Kakao Mobility in its latest report. ""Bikes have been with us for a long time, but has been newly received lately with the coronavirus.""           Ttareungyi rented out its bicycles 6.17 million times between March and May where social distancing schemes from the government were implemented for the first time. This is a 582 percent jump from the same period last year.           The emergence of such new mobility solutions will vitalize the industry, leading to fundamental changes in the industry.           ""The latest pandemic has lead people to think that such crises could happen at any time, and consequently people will continue to use such mobility solutions,"" said Lee Ho-joong, principal researcher in the technology policy department at the Korea Automotive Technology Institute.           ""Product and service development will follow such demand and the trend will likely continue for a while longer.""           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   ",                                  There cant be many cities with more comprehensive public transport than Seoul

     [HYUNDAI MOTOR GROUP]               The outbreak of the coronavirus sent jitters through industries across the world, and the automotive segment was no exception.           U.S. car sales in the first half dropped by 24 percent from the year before, and Germany, the biggest auto market in Europe, saw its car sales plunge by 35 percent during the cited period.           Korea, despite a strong tax subsidy from the government when buying a new car, recorded a mere 6.6 percent increase in car sales in the January-June period.           There was one segment, however, that bucked the trend: electric vehicles (EVs).           Sales of eco-friendly vehicles hit 90,000 units in the first half in Korea, a 29.7 percent on-year jump. The segment's share of the auto market accounted for 9.6 percent, an all-time high, while that of diesel shrank from 29.7 percent to 20.6 percent.           ""Multiple elements factored into the sales of EVs in Korea, but the biggest would be people's improved awareness of eco-friendly vehicles. Also, new models boast pretty long driving ranges, and the infrastructure has improved a lot lately,"" said Lee Hang-gu, a senior researcher at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.           ""Those who thought about buying a car or changing their car would have opted for the EV option. The government's tax subsidy on new purchases of cars contributed in driving up demand as well.""           The expanded eco-friendly lineup from imported carmakers played a major role in driving the growth of eco-friendly vehicles.           In terms of passenger cars, sales of pure electric vehicles from domestic carmakers dropped 42.6 percent, while those from imported carmakers jumped 150 percent in the first half on year.           Hybrid cars were especially strong. Hyundai Motor, the No. 1 carmaker in Korea by sales figures, recorded a 40.7 percent on-year jump in the first half of this year in selling hybrid models.           The Tesla lineup, represented by the Model 3 that sold nearly 10,000 units as of September, led the growth for imported carmakers, but new players like Audi's e-Tron, Peugeot's e-208 and e-2008, all of which launched here this year, contributed to the numbers.           On the back of such growth, experts expect next year will be a major turning point for the electric vehicle market globally.           ""With the new European Union CO2 emission regulation going into effect from next year, European carmakers will pour out new electric vehicle models,"" said Lee.           ""Hyundai and Kia are also launching their EV-dedicated platform E-GMP next year. Such a range of choices will keep pushing the EV market to grow exponentially.""            BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   ",     HYUNDAI MOTOR GROUP              The outbreak of the coronavirus sent jitters through industries across the world and the automotive segment was no exception          US car sales in the first half dropped by 24 percent from the year before and Germany the biggest auto market in Europe saw its car sales plunge by 35 percent during the cited period          Korea despite a strong tax subsidy from the government when buying a new car recorded a mere 66 percent increase in car sales in the JanuaryJune period          There was one segment however that bucked the trend electric vehicles EVs          Sales of ecofriendly vehicles hit 90000 units in the first half in Korea a 297 percent onyear jump The segments share of the auto market accounted for 96 percent an alltime high while that of diesel shrank from 297 percent to 206 percent          Multiple elements factored into the sales of EVs in Korea but the biggest would be peoples improved awareness of ecofriendly vehicles Also new models boast pretty long driving ranges and the infrastructure has improved a lot lately said Lee Hanggu a senior researcher at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics  Trade          Those who thought about buying a car or changing their car would have opted for the EV option The governments tax subsidy on new purchases of cars contributed in driving up demand as well          The expanded ecofriendly lineup from imported carmakers played a major role in driving the growth of ecofriendly vehicles          In terms of passenger cars sales of pure electric vehicles from domestic carmakers dropped 426 percent while those from imported carmakers jumped 150 percent in the first half on year          Hybrid cars were especially strong Hyundai Motor the No 1 carmaker in Korea by sales figures recorded a 407 percent onyear jump in the first half of this year in selling hybrid models          The Tesla lineup represented by the Model 3 that sold nearly 10000 units as of September led the growth for imported carmakers but new players like Audis eTron Peugeots e208 and e2008 all of which launched here this year contributed to the numbers          On the back of such growth experts expect next year will be a major turning point for the electric vehicle market globally          With the new European Union CO2 emission regulation going into effect from next year European carmakers will pour out new electric vehicle models said Lee          Hyundai and Kia are also launching their EVdedicated platform EGMP next year Such a range of choices will keep pushing the EV market to grow exponentially          BY JIN EUNSOO jineunsoojoongangcokr   
5,Kim Tae-hoon picks up Genesis Championship win,"

     Kim Tae-hoon watches his tee shot during the final round of the Genesis Championship at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea in Incheon on Sunday. [YONHAP]               INCHEON — Under cloudy weather, Kim Tae-hoon picked up a win at the Genesis Championship at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea on Sunday.           Shooting one over par, 73, on the final day, Kim won the tournament two shots ahead of Lee Jae-kyeong. Kim finished the tournament with a four-round total of six under par, 282.            Kim, who started the final round four shots ahead of the runners-up, didn’t get off to the best start in the front nine. Despite making a birdie on the par-4 fourth, Kim added bogeys on the par-3 fifth, par-4 sixth and the par-4 ninth. Another bogey on the par-4 10th put Kim in danger as his lead shrunk to one shot.            “Before I started my round, I was hitting really well [at the practice range],” Kim said. “I was hitting them the best out of the four days. So I got into the round with confidence. I was off to a great start by making a birdie, but with two back-to-back bogeys by making three-putts, I did get a little shaky because Lee Jae-kyeong, who was playing in a group ahead of us, got as close as one shot behind me. So I got really nervous.”            While Kim held a close one-shot lead, he finally started to make his move. With back-to-back birdies the par-3 13th and the par-4 14th, he once again extended his lead to two shots.            As Lee just missed his birdie putt on the final hole, Kim was given some breathing room as he was able to head into the par-5 18th with a two-shot lead. By making par, Kim secured his lead and picked up his fourth win on the KPGA Tour.            “In the back nine, I started to look over the things I wasn’t doing well in the front,” Kim said. “By doing so, I think I was able to pick up a win.”              Kim Tae-hoon poses for a photo with a trophy after winning the Genesis Championship at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea on Sunday. [YONHAP]               Kim took home the prize money of 300 million won ($262,200) and the Genesis GV80. Along with that, Kim is also given a berth in the 2020 CJ Cup at Nine Bridges, expected to begin on Thursday, and the PGA Tour’s 2021 Genesis Invitational.            Due to the coronavirus, however, the CJ Cup is being held in Las Vegas this season, and Kim has opted out of competing in it. With his decision, the top-four ranked players in the KPGA Tour’s Genesis point standing as of Sunday’s tournament will earn spots in the CJ Cup.           Now that the KPGA Tour has two more tournaments remaining in the season, Kim said his goal is to win the year-ending Genesis points standing. By winning Sunday’s tournament, Kim Tae-hoon moved up to second in the Genesis points standing, behind the current leader Kim Han-byeol.            “Since Han-byeol is competing at the CJ Cup, he won’t be competing in the next [KPGA] tournament,” Kim Tae-hoon said. “Once he gets back [to Korea], he will have to go through a two-week quarantine and then compete in the final tournament. Since he won’t have much time to practice, for me, I believe that I have a good chance.”           After an outstanding junior career in which he represented Korea on the national team, Kim made his pro debut with high expectations in 2007. But soon after his debut, he fell into a slump, from which he didn't recover until the 2013 season.           That season, Kim burst into the spotlight by making cuts in 10 of 11 tournaments he competed in. Of those 10, Kim finished within the top 10 in eight of the tournaments.            That season, Kim picked up his first-ever KPGA Tour victory at the Bosung CC Classic. Then, in 2015, he added his second win on the Tour at the Caido Golf LIS Tour Championship, the season finale.            Having spent another winless season in the 2016 and 2017 seasons, Kim added his third career win in 2018 at the Dong-A Membership Exchange Group Busan Open. It was an impressive victory, as he won by shooting a course record of nine under par, 63, on the final day.            After another two years in waiting, Kim finally added his fourth career win on Sunday.            While Kim picked up a win on the KPGA Tour, over on the KLPGA Tour, An Na-rin maintained her big lead to pick up her first-ever win on the Tour at the 2020 Autech Carrier Championship with Sejong Field Golf Club on Sunday.            Starting the final round with a big 10-shot lead ahead of the world No. 1 Ko Jin-young, KLPGA Tour’s rookie Ryu Hae-ran fiercely made her way up the leaderboard by shooting nine under par, 63, on the final day, to get within two shots of An.            However, An maintained her lead throughout the final round by shooting even par with back-to-back birdies on the last two holes. An finished the tournament four shots ahead of Ryu with a four-day total of 272.           Ryu finished runner-up with a four-day total at 12 under par, 276. Ko finished tied for third by shooting one under par, 71, on the final day to finish the tournament at eight under par, 281.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   ",     Kim

6,North Korea unveils huge new ICBM at military parade,"

      A new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) paraded on an 22-wheeled transporter erector launcher during a military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square on Saturday, the 75th anniversary of the North's ruling Workers' Party. [NEWS1]               North Korea unveiled an array of new weapons at a monumental military parade carried out in the dead of night on Saturday — among them novel forms of ballistic missiles capable of being launched from a submarine and across the Pacific Ocean.             The parade, which intelligence officials in Seoul said went on from 12 to 3 a.m. early Saturday morning in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square, was the culmination of months of preparations by the regime for the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party, undertaken amid one of the worst economic situations the country has faced in decades.             Footage of the ceremony broadcast by Korean Central Television Saturday evening showed on display a host of new strategic weapons the regime had been developing for years, including what appeared to be a short-range ballistic missile system known as the KN-23, a 600-mililmeter large caliber artillery gun and a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) labelled as the Pukkuksong-4A.           The centerpiece of the event was a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that appeared to be much larger than Pyongyang’s Hwasong-15 system — a weapon reportedly capable of reaching the continental United States.             The public debut of such an arsenal signaled to Washington months into a fraught stalemate in their denuclearization negotiations that Pyongyang’s priority remains to ensure the survival of its regime by any means possible.             That intent was made plain in North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s public address at the parade, in which he announced the induction of a war deterrent capable of containing threats from hostile powers, before adding that the North would never employ such means first without provocation.                North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, center, and top officials smile during a military parade to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party Saturday. [YONHAP]               “Our war deterrent, which is intended to defend the rights to independence and existence of our state and safeguard peace in the region, will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike,” Kim said, according to an English-language version of his speech carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.             “But, if, and if, any forces infringe upon the security of our state and attempt to have recourse to military force against us, I will enlist all our most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them.”           The vow to employ the weapons for defensive purposes only — and the omission of the term “nuclear” from their characterizations — appeared, however, to be attempts at toning down hostility ahead of incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election bid next month.             In line with this posturing, Kim also used his speech to relay a conciliatory overture to Seoul by expressing a “warm wish” to his “dear fellow countrymen in the south” that the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end quickly so that the “day would come when the North and South take each other’s hand again.”           The remark surprised many in Seoul, where public opinion has been souring against the North due to its escalatory actions against South Korea throughout the year. The tone of Kim’s overture notably mirrored the rare apology he offered the South last month after a South Korean fisheries official was shot and killed by a North Korean maritime patrol in Pyongyang’s waters.                 South Korea’s presidential office, the Blue House, on Sunday called on Pyongyang to work toward reducing hostilities in accordance to their military agreement signed in 2018, but added it would make relevant arrangements in light of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s apparent call for a restoration of inter-Korean ties.               Yet perhaps the most striking aspect of Kim’s address was just how emotional it was, with the dictator making rare expressions of contrition that highlighted the gravity of the North’s ongoing economic crisis.                North Korean leader Kim Jong-un tears up while delivering his speech at the military parade on Saturday, in footage released by Korean Central Television. [YONHAP]               Appearing to tear up on several occasions throughout the speech, Kim thanked his people 12 separate times for holding firm in spite of an unprecedented combination of hardships with the Covid-19 pandemic, “catastrophic natural disasters” and goods shortages resulting from ongoing international sanctions.           “Our people have placed trust, as high as the sky and as deep as the sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily,” Kim said. “I am really sorry for that.”           Kim’s admission of failure, unprecedented in a regime that regards its ruling Kim family as unassailable, appeared to be an attempt at remolding his image to that of a humble and devoted leader guiding the nation out of untold difficulties.           The tightly choreographed parade also featured thousands of troops marching in unison, accompanied by hosts of military equipment like tanks and planes, as well as fireworks to mark the occasion.                A scene from Saturday's military parade in Kim Il Sung Square, Pyongyang, with participants holding placards that together read ""Army of the [Workers'] Party."" [YONHAP]               International scrutiny, of course, was on the North’s new SLBM and ICBM systems on display, which marked the first time Pyongyang has showed off such weapons publicly since the Hwasong-15 was paraded at a similar occasion in February 2018.             According to Reuters, a senior U.S. administration official said the North’s continued efforts to expand its nuclear and missile program as seen in the unveiling of its new ICBM was “disappointing,” and called on Pyongyang to return to negotiations toward its complete denuclearization.           The new ICBM, which was carried out on a 11-axel transporter erector launcher (TEL), appeared larger and more advanced than the Hwasong-15, analysts said, possibly making it the largest mobile ICBM in the world with a length of around 23 to 24 meters (75 to 79 feet).             Some South Korean experts speculated the rocket’s enlarged size may be owed to major changes made to its primary and secondary propulsion systems that were tested on two occasions in December last year at its Sohae testing center on the west coast. Though it has not yet been tested, the upgraded booster may allow the missile to travel further than the Hwasong-15, which is believed to have an estimated range of around 13,000 kilometers (8,078 miles) — enough to hit Washington or New York.             The weapon, which Pyongyang may call Hwasong-16, was also large enough to carry multiple reentry vehicles, experts said, allowing it to hit multiple targets with warheads and be effectively harder to intercept.             But unlike some earlier speculations, the new ICBM does not appear to use a solid propellant, which would have drastically reduced the preparatory phase of a launch. One South Korean military official who requested anonymity told the JoongAng Ilbo the new ICBM appeared to used liquid fuel like its older counterparts.                A new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the Pukkuksong-4A, unveiled by North Korea in its parade on Saturday. [NEWS1]               Similarly ominous was the presentation of Pyongyang’s new Pukkuksong-4A SLBM, an altogether new missile that may be equipped on the regime’s new 3,000-ton submarine disclosed in state media photographs in July last year, or an even larger submarine reportedly under construction.             The SLBM’s range remains unknown, but could surpass that of the North’s older SLBM model Pukkuksong-3 which has a maximum range of around 3,000 to 4,000 kilometers, experts said.             “The Pukkuksong-4A’s outward appearance looks similar to China’s JL-2 multiple warhead SLBM,” said Kwon Yong-soo, a former professor at the South’s Korea National Defense University, in reference to Beijing’s 7,200-kilometer range missile.             “If [the Pukkuksong-4A] has a similar size to Pukkuksong-3, then unlike the JL-2 it may be designed to target the U.S. territory of Guam.”           Experts also lavished attention on the North’s array of TELs, the chassis used to carry its new ICBM during the parade, as well as its collection of short-range ballistic missile weapons unveiled Saturday following over a year of provocative testing since May 2019, all of which showed the regime had continued to enhance its missile capabilities amid its talks with Washington throughout the last two years.             “North Korea continues to evolve as a “normal” nuclear weapons power, focusing on improving and augmenting its systems for survivability and penetrability,” Vipin Narang, a North Korea nuclear expert and political science professor at M.I.T., wrote on Twitter.             “No big surprises, but more diversity and improved capabilities.

which was carried out on a 11axel transporter erector launcher TEL appeared larger and more advanced than the Hwasong15 analysts said possibly making it the largest mobile ICBM in the world with a length of around 23 to 24 meters 75 to 79 feet          Some South Korean experts speculated the rocket’s enlarged size may be owed to major changes made to its primary and secondary propulsion systems that were tested on two occasions in December last year at its Sohae testing center on the west coast Though it has not yet been tested the upgraded booster may allow the missile to travel further than the Hwasong15 which is believed to have an estimated range of around 13000 kilometers 8078 miles — enough to hit Washington or New York           The weapon which Pyongyang may call Hwasong16 was also large enough to carry multiple reentry vehicles experts said allowing it to hit multiple targets with warheads and be effectively harder to intercept           But unlike some earlier speculations the new ICBM does not appear to use a solid propellant which would have drastically reduced the preparatory phase of a launch One South Korean military official who requested anonymity told the JoongAng Ilbo the new ICBM appeared to used liquid fuel like its older counterparts              A new submarinelaunched ballistic missile SLBM the Pukkuksong4A unveiled by North Korea in its parade on Saturday NEWS1              Similarly ominous was the presentation of Pyongyang’s new Pukkuksong4A SLBM an altogether new missile that may be equipped on the regime’s new 3000ton submarine disclosed in state media photographs in July last year or an even larger submarine reportedly under construction           The SLBM’s range remains unknown but could surpass that of the North’s older SLBM model Pukkuksong3 which has a maximum range of around 3000 to 4000 kilometers experts said          “The Pukkuksong4A’s outward appearance looks similar to China’s JL2 multiple warhead SLBM” said Kwon Yongsoo a former professor at the South’s Korea National Defense University in reference to Beijing’s 7200kilometer range missile           “If the Pukkuksong4A has a similar size to Pukkuksong3 then unlike the JL2 it may be designed to target the US territory of Guam”          Experts also lavished attention on the North’s array of TELs the chassis used to carry its new ICBM during the parade as well as its collection of shortrange ballistic missile weapons unveiled Saturday following over a year of provocative testing since May 2019 all of which showed the regime had continued to enhance its missile capabilities amid its talks with Washington throughout the last two years           “North Korea continues to evolve as a “normal” nuclear weapons power focusing on improving and augmenting its systems for survivability and penetrability” Vipin Narang a North Korea nuclear expert and political science professor at MIT wrote on Twitter           “No big surprises but more diversity and improved capabilities They aren’t giving them up”          BY SHIM KYUSEOK shimkyuseokjoongangcokr   
7,"Heroes manager resigns, accepts responsibility for team's recent struggles","

     Kiwoom Heroes manager Son Hyuk. [YONHAP]               Kiwoom Heroes manager Son Hyuk resigned Wednesday after the team's 4-3 loss to the NC Dinos.           In a statement announcing Son's resignation on Thursday, the Heroes said Son stepped down to take full responsibility for the team’s recent struggles. Son reportedly spoke with general manager Kim Chi-hyun after the Dinos game on Wednesday.            Following their conversation, the Heroes decided to accept Son’s decision to resign.           “I’m thankful to the club for appointing me as a manager,” Son said. “I also feel bad for not being able to meet the expectations. I’m sorry to the fans who had high expectations and to the players.”           Son’s resignation came as quite a surprise as the Heroes are still in a safe position to advance to the postseason. When Son announced his resignation, the Heroes were ranked third in the KBO’s regular season standing, nine games behind the top-ranked Dinos.            The move came as a surprise, as the Heroes only had 12 games remaining until the end of the regular season.            Following the announcement, the Heroes appointed quality control coach Kim Chang-hyeon as the interim manager for the remaining games.                Kim Chang-hyeon. [NEWS1]               Although Kim doesn’t have any experience in the KBO, he previously played baseball for Kyung Hee University. Following college, Kim joined the Heroes in 2013, working in the analytics department.            As the Heroes believe that Kim has a great depth of understanding and data analysis skills, the club decided to appoint its quality control coach as its interim manager.             “Due to Covid-19, the regular season got delayed and saw a lot of injured players,” said general manager Kim Chi-hyun. “We want to thank manager Son for trying his best. Since we only have a few more games remaining in the season and are currently fiercely competing in the pennant race, we’ll strengthen communication between the front office and the team on the field. We’ll try our best to produce the best result using a date-driven approach.”     However, things aren’t looking too good for the Heroes since Son’s resignation, as the team lost its Sunday game to the bottom-ranked Hanwha Eagles 9-3. As of Sunday's game, the Heroes have 75 wins, a draw and 60 losses.        BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]          ",     Kiwoom Heroes manager Son Hyuk YONHAP              Kiwoom Heroes manager Son Hyuk resigned Wednesday after the teams 43 loss to the NC Dinos          In a statement announcing Sons resignation on Thursday the Heroes said Son stepped down to take full responsibility for the team’s recent struggles Son reportedly spoke with general manager Kim Chihyun after the Dinos game on Wednesday           Following their conversation the Heroes decided to accept Son’s decision to resign          “I’m thankful to the club for appointing me as a manager” Son said “I also feel bad for not being able to meet the expectations I’m sorry to the fans who had high expectations and to the players”          Son’s resignation came as quite a surprise as the Heroes are still in a safe position to advance to the postseason When Son announced his resignation the Heroes were ranked third in the KBO’s regular season standing nine games behind the topranked Dinos           The move came as a surprise as the Heroes only had 12 games remaining until the end of the regular season           Following the announcement the Heroes appointedquality control coach Kim Changhyeon as the interim manager for the remaining games              Kim Changhyeon NEWS1              Although Kim doesn’t have any experience in the KBO he previously played baseball for Kyung Hee University Following college Kim joined the Heroes in 2013 working in the analytics department           As the Heroes believe that Kim has a great depth of understanding and data analysis skills the club decided to appoint its quality control coach as its interim manager           “Due to Covid19 the regular season got delayed and saw a lot of injured players” said general manager Kim Chihyun “We want to thank manager Son for trying his best Since we only have a few more games remaining in the season and are currently fiercely competing in the pennant race we’ll strengthen communication between the front office and the team on the field We’ll try our best to produce the best result using a datedriven approach”     However things aren’t looking too good for the Heroes since Son’s resignation as the team lost its Sunday game to the bottomranked Hanwha Eagles 93 As of Sundays game the Heroes have 75 wins a draw and 60 losses      BY KANG YOORIM  kangyoorimjoongangcokr        
8,Nation to return to Level 1 restrictions after decline in new virus cases,"

     Students undergo body temperature checks before testing for an exam at Sungshin Women's University in central Seoul on Sunday. [YONHAP]         Nationwide social distancing restrictions will be relaxed to Level 1 starting Monday, although most requirements for cafes and high-risk businesses in the greater Seoul area will be maintained, the prime minister announced Sunday.           “The average number of daily cases in the past two weeks was around 60 or less, and we are seeing some positive signs when it comes to controlling the outbreak,” said Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun in a meeting at the Central Government Complex in Seoul on Sunday.           Most of Korea has been under the Level 2 restrictions since mid-August, when Korea experienced a second surge of cases after its initial large-scale outbreak in late February and March.           The biggest change affects indoor and outdoor gatherings. Under Level 2, indoor gatherings were limited to 50 people at most, with outdoor gatherings limited to 100. There are no such restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings under Level 1, as long as participants wear masks and take other precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus.             For sports fans the change is welcome news, as it means audiences will be allowed to return to stadiums again — though attendance will be limited by the one-meter (3.28 feet) social distancing recommendations.           Similar guidelines will remain in place for cafes and restaurants in Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon, where the recent surge in Covid-19 cases has been concentrated.           “We will keep the necessary measures from the Level 2 recommendation in the greater Seoul area, where the numbers are still quite high, especially for certain high-risk businesses,” Chung said.             These include placing tables at least one meter apart from each other. Customers inside restaurants and cafes will be asked to have their masks on when not eating or drinking.             Certain high-risk businesses — such as clubs, bars that involve dancing and moving between tables, door-to-door sales businesses and noraebangs (booth-type singing rooms) — that were shut down since mid-August were allowed to re-open under their local government offices' directives beginning Oct. 5 in areas outside of the greater Seoul area.             Forced to remain closed in the greater Seoul area, those businesses will be allowed to open from Monday, but will be asked to limit the number of customers to ensure minimum social distancing.             Churches, some of which were also at the center of the recent surge of Covid-19 cases, will be allowed to hold in-person services again, but with limited numbers of congregants and with measures to allow quick tracing in case of outbreaks, such as keeping an entry log for members attending services.             Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae also announced Sunday that kindergartens, elementary and middle schools throughout the country, which have been allowing only a third of the student body to be present in school at a time, will allow up to two-thirds of students to return, starting Oct. 19. High schools have allowed two-thirds to be physically present, and will maintain this level.           Some schools may seek to allow their entire student bodies to attend classes every day by allowing half of the students to take morning classes only and half afternoon classes only.           “We ask not to have the whole student body present at one given time together,” Yoo said in a press briefing.                                Prior to the weekend, there were growing concerns that conservative rallies would take place once again in the Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul to commemorate Hangul Day. A large rally held there in mid-August generated one of Korea's largest coronavirus clusters and helped drive the second surge in Covid-19 cases.           The government dismissed requests from groups to hold rallies there the past weekend, and blocked the square using police buses and other government vehicles.             “No one rallied at the square and we are thankful to all groups who refrained from doing so for the sake of public health and safety,” Chung said.             Korea recorded 58 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, of which 12 were imported. It was the fourth day in a row that the numbers stayed in the double digits.           Among the 46 domestic cases, 19 were based in Seoul and 18 in Gyeonggi.             A recent cluster traced to a hospital in Dobong District, northern Seoul grew to 59 cases, 51 cases have been traced to a hospital in Euijeongbu, Gyeonggi and 20 cases were traced to a family gathering over the Chuseok holidays

9,"Deadly pig virus spreads to 2nd farm, prompts slaughter of 2,500 hogs","

     Quarantine workers restrict entry into a farm confirmed to be infected with African swine fever in Hwacheon,Gangwon on Sunday. [YONHAP]               A second pig farm on Saturday detected cases of the deadly African swine fever in Hwacheon County, Gangwon, following an outbreak last week at a nearby farm.            The pigs at the new farm have already been killed, as it was subject to a collective culling in response to last week's outbreak.           The Agriculture Ministry ordered around 2,500 pigs from three hog farms in the region to be slaughtered. The ministry decided to cull all 945 pigs on the farm that supplied them, plus an additional 1,525 from two farms located within 10 kilometers (6 miles).           This was the first time in a year that the disease was found in farm pigs.           According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, three female pigs were found dead in a slaughterhouse in Cheorwon County, Gangwon, on Thursday. They were all later confirmed to have been infected by the disease, and were among the eight infected pigs from the Hwacheon pig farm.           The government agency said it will inspect 373 pig farms in Gangwon and Gyeonggi for additional cases. So far, it has collected field samples from 291 farms, of which 163 farms tested negative for the virus.             African swine fever has no known cure, and culling is the only way to prevent its spread.           The government also ordered a 48-hour lockdown on pig farms, slaughterhouses, feed factories and vehicles working at such facilities in Gangwon and Gyeonggi until Monday at 5 a.m.           Wild boars had been infected with the disease in Hwacheon, but this was the first time pigs on farms were affected. The farm where the three dead pigs were found was just 250 meters (820 feet) from the point where the infected wild boars were found.           Within the county, around 290 wild boar carcasses have been found to be infected so far.           After the first outbreak in Paju, Gyeonggi, in September 2019, more than 430,000 pigs were culled to prevent the spread of the virus. Thinking the disease had died down, the Agriculture Ministry had started to ease regulations on pig farms. On Aug. 9, farms that had culled pigs due to the earlier outbreak in Gyeonggi and Gangwon were allowed to resume taking in new pigs. That was halted indefinitely on Friday.           BY PARK EUN-JEE, SONG KYOUNG-SON   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]         ",     Quarantine workers restrict entry into a farm confirmed to be infected with African swine fever in HwacheonGangwon on Sunday YONHAP              A second pig farm on Saturday detected cases of the deadly African swine fever in Hwacheon County Gangwon following an outbreak last week at a nearby farm          The pigs at the new farm have already been killed as it was subject to a collective culling in response to last weeks outbreak          The Agriculture Ministry ordered around 2500 pigs from three hog farms in the region to be slaughtered The ministry decided to cull all 945 pigs on the farm that supplied them plus an additional 1525 from two farms located within 10 kilometers 6 miles          This was the first time in a year that the disease was found in farm pigs          According to the Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs three female pigs were found dead in a slaughterhouse in Cheorwon County Gangwon on Thursday They were all later confirmed to have been infected by the disease and were among the eight infected pigs from the Hwacheon pig farm          The government agency said it will inspect 373 pig farms in Gangwon and Gyeonggi for additional cases So far it has collected field samples from 291 farms of which 163 farms tested negative for the virus           African swine fever has no known cure and culling is the only way to prevent its spread          The government also ordered a 48hour lockdown on pig farms slaughterhouses feed factories and vehicles working at such facilities in Gangwon and Gyeonggi until Monday at 5 am          Wild boars had been infected with the disease in Hwacheon but this was the first time pigs on farms were affected The farm where the three dead pigs were found was just 250 meters 820 feet from the point where the infected wild boars were found          Within the county around 290 wild boar carcasses have been found to be infected so far          After the first outbreak in Paju Gyeonggi in September 2019 more than 430000 pigs were culled to prevent the spread of the virus Thinking the disease had died down the Agriculture Ministry had started to ease regulations on pig farms On Aug 9 farms that had culled pigs due to the earlier outbreak in Gyeonggi and Gangwon were allowed to resume taking in new pigs That was halted indefinitely on Friday          BY PARK EUNJEE SONG KYOUNGSON  parkeunjeejoongangcokr        
10,Car fires prompt Hyundai Motor to expand Kona recall overseas,"






     Firefighters douse flames erupting from a Hyundai Kona electric vehicle that burst into flames last July near an office in Gangneung, Gangwon. [GANGNEUNG FIRE DEPARTMENT]               Hyundai Motor will voluntarily recall some 51,000 fire-prone Kona electric vehicles (EVs) sold in international markets, the company announced Sunday, following last week's decision to recall Kona vehicles sold in Korea.            This is 70 percent of Hyundai's Kona EVs sold internationally, as of the first half of 2020. In total, 77,067 Kona EVs sold will be subject to the expanded recall, which applies only to those manufactured in Korea.           Cars will be recalled in one region after another, beginning as early as next week. A total of 77,748 Kona EVs were sold outside of Korea, with Europe accounting for the largest regional share at 48 percent.             Hyundai Motor America has reportedly submitted plans to voluntarily recall all Kona EVs sold in the United States with the country's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.           The automaker plans to investigate any anomalies in the batteries after updating its battery management system, and says it will replace them if there are any signs of damage, including significant changes in battery temperature.           Including the latest incident in which a Kona EV burst into flames in a Daegu parking lot, there have been 12 reports worldwide of the vehicles catching fire, according to a report submitted to a Democratic Party (DP) lawmaker from the Korea Transportation Safety Authority.           The Kona is the second-best-selling EV in Korea after Tesla’s Model 3. More than 100,000 Kona EVs have been sold worldwide since 2018.            Battery maker LG Chem and Hyundai Motor are at odds regarding what has caused the vehicles to catch on fire.           The Transport Ministry suspects a defect in the battery’s separator may have caused a short circuit, subsequently causing the battery to catch fire. LG Chem, which supplies the battery for Hyundai Motor EVs, has strongly protested against the blame being put on its product.           LG Chem released a statement on Oct. 8, immediately after Hyundai decided to recall all Kona EVs in Korea, arguing that the announcement was made without confirmed evidence that pinpoints a default in the batteries to be the cause of EVs catching fire. The battery maker said it will actively cooperate with Hyundai Motor to investigate the cause.           Hyundai Motor may be rushing to recall all its EVs in a bid to tamp down growing consumer distrust surrounding the safety of its electric-powered vehicles, experts said.             Hyundai Motor Chairperson Eui-sun Chung proclaimed in July that 2021 will be a watershed year in the company's push for EVs. Hyundai plans to sell one million electric vehicles with the goal of reaching 10 percent of the global market share by the year 2025. There are 23 models of EVs scheduled for launch over the next five years.             But the automaker's recent difficulties are unlikely to subside soon. Customers have called Hyundai’s recall measures insufficient for only updating the battery management system, and not the battery itself.             More than 1,000 owners of Kona EVs have reportedly signed a petition to take collective action against the company, according to an online community of EV drivers in Korea.             BY KANG JAE-EUN  [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleHyundai Motor recalls Kona EVs after spate of firesHyundai apologizes for Kona EV fires, promises investigationBattery system blamed as Kona EVs start bursting into flames",     Firefighters douse flames erupting from a Hyundai Kona electric vehicle that burst into flames last July near an office in Gangneung Gangwon GANGNEUNG FIRE DEPARTMENT              Hyundai Motorwill voluntarily recall some 51000 fireprone Kona electric vehicles EVs sold in international markets the company announced Sunday following last weeks decision to recall Kona vehicles sold in Korea          This is 70 percent of Hyundais Kona EVs sold internationally as of the first half of 2020 In total 77067Kona EVs sold will be subject to the expanded recall which applies only to those manufactured in Korea          Cars will be recalled in one region after another beginning as early as next week A total of 77748 Kona EVs were sold outside of Korea with Europe accounting for the largest regional share at 48 percent           Hyundai Motor America has reportedly submitted plans to voluntarily recall all Kona EVs sold in the United States with the countrys National Highway Traffic Safety Administration          The automaker plans to investigate any anomalies in the batteries after updating its battery management system and says it will replace them if there are any signs of damage including significant changes in battery temperature          Including the latest incident in which a Kona EV burst into flames in a Daegu parking lot there have been 12 reports worldwide of the vehicles catching fire according to a report submitted to a Democratic Party DP lawmaker from the Korea Transportation Safety Authority          The Kona is the secondbestselling EV in Korea after Tesla’s Model 3 More than 100000 Kona EVs have been sold worldwide since 2018          Battery maker LG Chem and Hyundai Motor are at odds regarding what has caused the vehicles to catch on fire          The Transport Ministry suspects a defect in the battery’s separator may have caused a short circuit subsequently causing the battery to catch fire LG Chem which supplies the battery for Hyundai Motor EVs has strongly protested against the blame being put on its product          LG Chem released a statement on Oct 8 immediately after Hyundai decided to recall all Kona EVs in Korea arguing that the announcement was made without confirmed evidence that pinpoints a default in the batteries to be the cause ofEVs catching fire The battery maker said it will actively cooperate with Hyundai Motor to investigate the cause          Hyundai Motormay be rushing to recall all its EVs in a bid to tamp down growing consumer distrust surrounding the safety of its electricpowered vehicles experts said           Hyundai MotorChairperson Euisun Chung proclaimed in July that 2021 will be a watershed year in the companys push for EVs Hyundai plans to sell one million electric vehicles with the goal of reaching 10 percent of the global market share by the year 2025 There are 23 models of EVs scheduled for launch over the next five years          But the automakers recent difficulties are unlikely to subside soon Customers have called Hyundai’s recall measures insufficient for only updating the battery management system and not the battery itself           More than 1000 owners of Kona EVs have reportedly signed a petition to take collective action against the company according to an online community of EV drivers in Korea           BY KANG JAEEUN kangjaeeunjoongangcokr        Related ArticleHyundai Motor recalls Kona EVs after spate of firesHyundai apologizes for Kona EV fires promises investigationBattery system blamed as Kona EVs start bursting into flames
11,Ulsan officials investigating cause of massive blaze that engulfed high-rise building,"

     Officers of Ulsan police and fire department are inspecting on Sunday the high-rise apartment building in the city which was ablaze for more than 15 hours form Thursday to Friday, to determine the cause of the fire. [NEWS1]         Ulsan police and fire officials on Sunday began investigating the cause of a Thursday night fire that engulfed a high-rise apartment building in the city and burned for more than 15 hours.           “Our investigations will focus on where the fire began,” Eom Joon-wook, chief of the Ulsan Fire Department, said during a press briefing Saturday. “At this point we don’t have a clear indication of where that was.”           The initial report that the 33-floor apartment building in Nam District, Ulsan, was on fire came from a resident on the 12th floor, on Thursday at 11:14 p.m., according to the Ulsan Fire Department. The resident said they could see “flames on the outdoor unit of the air conditioner” from their window. Firefighters arrived within five minutes of the report, the fire department said.            “Some residents in the area said they saw the fire start on the third floor of the building, but the first report to the fire department came from the 12th floor of the building,” an Ulsan police officer said Sunday.           As flames spread to the upper floors, the fire appeared to engulf the whole building at one point during the night. Ulsan does not have a fire engine with a ladder longer than 70 meters (230 feet), so 89 vehicles and 272 firefighters from Busan, Daegu, Changwon and other areas of South and North Gyeongsang were sent to the site. The apartment building is 113 meters tall.           Korea's fire departments have just 10 ladders taller than 70 meters — two each in Gyeonggi, Seoul and Incheon and one each in Busan, Daejeon, Sejong and Jeju, according to the office of Democratic Party (DP) Rep. Park Wan-joo.           There are 4,692 buildings that reach higher than 30 floors throughout the country. A majority of them are apartments.           The office in a statement last week called for a general inspection of firefighting facilities throughout the country, and to make improvements to firefighting equipment where necessary.           Four helicopters were mobilized, allowing firefighters to enter the building from above.           The apartment was home to 127 households — around 190 residents total — when the fire broke out. All of them were evacuated or rescued from the rooftop in the first hours of the fire.           The fire was finally extinguished at around 2:50 p.m. on Friday. Authorities reported that 93 people were hospitalized and treated for smoke inhalation, but that there were no deaths or severe injuries.           As many as 175 of the residents have been unable to return home since their evacuation Thursday night, and have been temporarily relocated to nearby hotel rooms. Relocation costs are being covered by the Ulsan city government, whose budget can cover up to 30,000 won ($26.20) in daily living expenses per evacuee in such circumstances.           “Some people have criticized our accommodation to be overboard, but this was the best option we could come up with given that we are in a Covid-19 situation and cannot resort to the normal means to evacuating a large number of people in one place, which would provide ample grounds for a possible outbreak,” said Song Cheol-ho, mayor of Ulsan, in a press briefing on Friday. “Right now, our priority is to protect the evacuees. We can figure out the costs later through investigations and appropriate insurance policies.”           The Ulsan city government said that it may seek compensation once the cause of the fire is determined.           The Ulsan education office said it will be providing new sets of textbooks and uniforms as needed to the 52 students who reside at the building, of whom five are kindergarteners, 20 are elementary school students, 11 are in middle school and 16 are high school students.             The initial inspections began Friday to determine if the building was safe to enter and whether additional structures would need to be installed.           The Ulsan police and fire department said they will also be examining the CCTV camera footage of the apartment hallways to determine where the fire began.           BY ESTHER CHUNG, BAEK KYUNG-SEO   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   ",     Officers of Ulsan police and fire department are inspecting on Sunday the highrise apartment building

14,PPP accuses prosecution of protecting Moon administration in Lime Asset probe,"

     Kang Ki-jung, former senior presidential secretary for political affairs.  [YONHAP]                Questioning the prosecution's political integrity, the main opposition party on Sunday demanded that the prosecutors stop protecting key members of the Moon Jae-in administration involved in massive corruption scandals and conduct proper investigations.             “Former Chairman [of Star Mobility] Kim Bong-hyun testified in a courtroom that he had given a bribe to former senior presidential secretary for political affairs Kang Ki-jung,” Rep. Kim Eun-hye, spokeswoman for the People Power Party (PPP), said in a Sunday statement. “His account was specific enough that it cannot be a lie.”             Kim is a primary suspect in a financial fraud case that effectively brought down Korea's largest hedge fund, Lime Asset Management.            On Thursday, Kim took the witness stand in the trial of his co-conspirator Lee Kang-se, a journalist hired as Star Mobility CEO to lobby the government, and testified that he had paid 50 million won ($44,000) to Kang through Lee in July last year. Kang was Moon's senior secretary for political affairs from January 2019 till August 2020.                In this file photo, Kim Bong-hyun, former chairman of Star Mobility and a key suspect in the financial fraud scandal surrounding Lime Asset Management, leaves a police building in Suwon, Gyeonggi, on April 26, 2020, to attend a warrant hearing.  YONHAP]                Kang has denied the testimony, calling it both perjury and defamation. Although Kim made no mention of President Moon,  Kang added, “This is a matter going beyond my personal reputation. I cannot allow them to stain the integrity of President Moon and our administration.”             PPP Rep. Kim on Sunday questioned the district prosecutors’ willingness to go after Kang. She suggested that prosecutors are uninterested in getting to the bottom of the Lime Asset Management scandal, because more powerful figures were involved in it.           After he was arrested in April, Kim Bong-hyun told the Seoul Southern Prosecutors’ Office about the alleged bribe to Kang, the JoongAng Ilbo reported, citing unnamed sources within the prosecution. The prosecutors did not investigate his statement.           The information linking a top presidential aide to the scandal was also never passed along to the Supreme Public Prosecutors’ Office, the newspaper reported. According to prosecution sources, Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl became aware of Kang’s alleged connection to Lime Asset Management only after Kim’s court testimony was reported by the media last week.             Yoon then ordered his aides to check why he was kept in the dark about Kim’s statement, and why Kang’s suspected link to the financial scandal was never investigated during the past months, the newspaper reported.            “If Kim told prosecutors about Kang during an official investigation, but the district prosecutors decided to omit it in the report, this is a crime [akin to] fabricating an official document,” said a prosecutor.             “We wonder why the prosecution is voluntarily scaling down the probe,” Rep. Kim said. “Why are the prosecutors so afraid of laying bare the truth? Their behavior fuels our curiosity about whose name will come up at the end of this corruption scandal.”             Another PPP spokeswoman criticized the prosecution for trying to conceal the suspicious connection between the massive financial scandal and the Moon administration.             “Kim Bong-hyun, a key suspect in the scandal, which led to about 1.6 trillion won losses for its investors, gave sworn testimony in a courtroom about Kang’s connection,” said Kim Ye-ryoung, spokeswoman of the PPP. “He also testified to the court that Kang, on behalf of him, made an appeal to Kim Sang-jo, policy chief of the Blue House, [to go easy on Lime Asset Management when the financial authorities investigate it].”             She said it is unbelievable that the prosecution would be working to conceal crimes allegedly committed by key members of the administration. Top members of the ruling Democratic Party, including Chairman Lee Nak-yon, were allegedly linked to another financial scandal, Optimus Asset Management.           Blue House aides were accused of having abused their power to influence the Ulsan mayoral election and shut down an audit into Moon’s ally, but the prosecution has no intentions to conduct proper investigations into the allegations, Kim said.             “The prosecution must conduct fair and meticulous investigations to convince the people,” she said. “If necessary, it must think about creating an independent team.”

15,[Behind the Lyrics] Yoon Hyun-sang writes with wit and sings with heart,"

     Singer-songwriter Yoon Hyun-sang sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. [BYUN JU-YEON]             K-pop often conjures thoughts of acrobatic dance moves and bass-heavy hits performed by the many members of the boy bands and girl groups Korea has to offer, but the pool of talented indie singer-songwriters is just as rich and colorful as the sounds they create. Unlike many of the idol bands that perform songs written and produced by others, these singers take their music into their own hands and establish fan bases solely based on their songs. Through this series, the Korea JoongAng Daily will sit down with up-and-coming solo indie singers and learn the stories behind their lyrics, while also finding out more about their lives, loves and interests.          When singer-songwriter Yoon Hyun-sang debuted in 2014, he introduced himself as “A vocalist with a feel and color.” Six years have passed, and he says he can finally call himself a singer, not just a vocalist.           Yoon’s path to becoming a singer began in 2012 when he became one of the top seven contestants in the first season of TV channel SBS’s audition program “Kpop Star,” impressing a panel of judges consisting of some of the biggest names in K-pop. What impressed the judges, as well as the viewers, was not only the tenderness of his velvety voice, but also his command over his vocals that was only heightened by the songs he had composed.           As a singer, he immerses himself into the emotions of the song so truly and deeply that what he emanates dyes the listeners’ mood in the same color as his own, whether it’s a song about love, heartbreak or even a hangover. As a songwriter, he employs the utmost scrutiny and intention to bring out the best from his songs.           “I like to think that I’m ambivalent,” Yoon said. “There is a side of myself when I’m making music and a side of myself outside of that, and they’re different. I focus on the emotions of the song when I’m writing it. But just because you listen to a love song, it doesn’t mean you’re thinking about the undying emotions of love throughout the 24 hours of the day, right?”              Yoon Hyun-sang competes in the first season of TV channel SBS’s audition program ’Kpop Star"" to become one of the top seven contestants. [SBS]               It took him two years after appearing on the audition show to debut with his EP “Pianoforte,” but when the time came, he was more than ready for his entrance onto the music scene.           Not only did he write every song on the six-track EP himself, but the lead track “When would it be” also caught the attention of singer IU — who was also signed at Yoon’s then-agency Loen Entertainment. When IU asked if she could have the song to release herself, the agency suggested that the two singers duet, leading to a collaboration between Yoon and one of the most popular singers in K-pop.           Yoon has since been building his repertoire with his own songs that span across a variety of genres, including folk, ballad and R&B, “anything except for EDM and hip-hop,” according to the singer. He held his very first solo concert in 2018 and released his single “Mild” in July, promising fans that he will be releasing an EP by the end of this year, filled with songs that he has, of course, written himself.           His songs are loved for their casual and easygoing mood, along with a touch of uniqueness that comes from his one-of-a-kind voice. Even with celebrity endorsements from actor Lee Min-ho and singer Dino of Seventeen, Yoon remains humble.           The Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with Yoon, to delve deeper into his songwriting and who he is outside of music. The following are edited excerpts.              Singer-songwriter Yoon Hyun-sang sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. [BYUN JU-YEON]             What made you participate in the audition show “Kpop Star” and become a singer?       Since I was younger, honestly, I wasn’t anything else that I could do except for music. From a very young age, I just dreamed that one day I would become a singer.It took little time for me to debut after the show, but I felt more worried about not being totally ready as a singer rather than not being able to debut straight away. It actually gave me time to write songs and see things in a different light, in a broader light. I think it all helped me.             Can you name the three songs that you think will give listeners a good overview of your music?       I would recommend “My memory warehouse,” “Silhouette” and “Dancing Universe.” Oh, can I add one more? It would also be nice to add the latest release, “Mild.”I think a lot of people think that singer Yoon Hyun-sang only sings slow-tempo ballad songs, but I’ve been trying to make a variety of music that shows the different colors of who I am. I want people to notice that, so I’ve chosen these songs, which are quite different from each other.            The cover of single ""WAVE"" (2015) which includes the track ""Tipsy: 20 Blues"" [MOONHWAIN]             Do you have a favorite among your songs?       I end up listening to a song so many times from the moment I start writing it, until it’s done. The ones I’ve released recently, I listened to so many times that I’m fed up in a way. But the one’s that I released in the past, I come back to them every now and then. I think the songs I wrote in the earlier stages of my career are closer to my heart. One of them is called “Tipsy: 20 Blues.” That one is especially close to my heart.The song starts with the line, “The tipsiness walks all over me.” At first listen, it just feels like a person feels tipsy because of the alcohol. But as the song progresses, it talks more about the “tipsiness” and how young people feel disoriented with their lives, because of the thoughts and dilemmas they come across for the first time. It’s about youth and finding my own path. We get beaten down by our own thoughts, and I tried to show that and it makes it quite meaningful for me.             You introduced yourself as “A vocalist with a feel and color” in “Kpop Star.” Would you say it differently if you could go back?       It is a little embarrassing, but I don’t regret it. I was 18 back then, and I wanted to show people the untamed energy of youth. I tend to think that there are certain things that people can do only when they’re a certain age, and I think people should do them — do the things you can at that age. I didn’t really think I had “feel and color,” but I just blurted out whatever came to my mind as a way to make it stick to people’s memories.I do think I am a “singer with a feel and color” now. I was a vocalist aspiring to be a singer back then, but at least I have debuted now. The only fans I had back then were my family and friends from school — who were all very supportive. I might not be a huge star now, but I have people who like my music. I feel it every moment.             Why do you call yourself a small star?       My first concert was in 2018, which is quite late considering I debuted in 2014. It was really memorable, and I never had to look after myself so thoroughly for two days. I even had to quit drinking for a month before the concert and I think that was the hardest time of my life (laughs).But I’m not the type to find myself in a slump. I think slumps are only allowed for the top stars. Personally, I think the tough times that we come across before we’ve actually accomplished anything isn’t a slump. Is that weird? Success is an idea that’s open to interpretation. It could be the Billboard charts for someone, but for me, it’s a singer who can put on concerts frequently — since I haven’t been able to do that, especially this year.            The cover of ""Mild"" released in July [MOONHWAIN]             How you do write your songs?       I start with the big idea. I think what’s being conveyed within the song can be someone’s emotions, but I think it’s all about the skills of expressing it. Just like everyone goes through different breakups and gets different ideas when they think about a breakup, I try to find the best expressions to fit the idea. I jot down the things that come to my mind, but I don’t end up using any of them. It feels so cheesy. The momentary blurts of emotions are important, but not very useful.       Who do you think likes your music?       I like to think that a variety of people will like my music. I know that a lot of my songs are calm, but I wish that people from different age groups and genders will all listen to them. But I do think female listeners would prefer my music.I used to like it in the past when people noticed the things I intended in my music, but there were people who always came up with different ideas. I’ve come to like that feedback more. So nowadays, I try not to tell people what the song is about. I just tell them how I felt when I was writing it, because I know that other people can interpret it differently.There was a song called “Always be with you” (2014) on the debut EP. It was a peaceful love song, but some people told me that it sounded really sad in a way. I never intended it to be so, but if you think about it, sometimes loving someone too much can bring you to tears. The idea that people could take it differently like that was so fascinating.             How did you feel when you learned that celebrities were listening to your songs?       Honestly, the first thought was, “More people are going to listen to the songs now.” The realistic thoughts came to my mind first. It felt nice that more diverse people were going to listen to my music. Then the second thought was that it felt so fulfilling to know that people who work in the same industry as me — although in different fields — liked my songs. It felt good in both ways.             You promised your fans an EP would come within the end of the year. Can you give us a hint about what it will be like?       I’ve been working on it, but I don’t have a lot of songs that I like at the moment. I plan on releasing it, definitely. I think a lot of people think that my songs are casual and natural in a way. But with this album, I’m planning on going for a “fancier” style. It could be with the diversity of the musical genre, the singing style or the lyrics — whatever it turns out to be, I’m going for something fancier.             What kind of an artist do you want to be remembered as?       I’ve thought about this for a while. I thought about what kind of an artist I wanted to become and how I want to be remembered. When I was younger, I was greedy and I wanted to be a good artist, an artist with good music. Now, I just want to be remembered for a long time in whatever sense, as long as it’s good. I think that’s the most meaningful and biggest success I could have. And as a person, I just wish that I’m not hated (laughs).         BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   ",     Singersongwriter Yoon Hyunsang sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily BYUN JUYEON            Kpop often conjures thoughts of acrobatic dance moves and bassheavy hits performed by the many members of the boy bands and girl groups Korea has to offer but the pool of talented indie singersongwriters is just as rich and colorful as the sounds they create Unlike many of the idol bands that perform songs written and produced by others these singers take their music into their own hands and establish fan bases solely based on their songs Through this series the Korea JoongAng Daily will sit down with upandcoming solo indie singers and learn the stories behind their lyrics while also finding out more about their lives loves and interests         When singersongwriter Yoon Hyunsang debuted in 2014 he introduced himself as “A vocalist with a feel and color” Six years have passed and he says he can finally call himself a singer not just a vocalist          Yoon’s path to becoming a singer began in 2012 when he became one of the top seven contestants in the first season of TV channel SBS’s audition program “Kpop Star” impressing a panel of judges consisting of some of the biggest names in Kpop What impressed the judges as well as the viewers was not only the tenderness of his velvety voice but also his command over his vocals that was only heightened by the songs he had composed          As a singer he immerses himself into the emotions of the song so truly and deeply that what he emanates dyes the listeners’ mood in the same color as his own whether it’s a song about love heartbreak or even a hangover As a songwriter he employs the utmost scrutiny and intention to bring out the best from his songs          “I like to think that I’m ambivalent” Yoon said “There is a side of myself when I’m making music and a side of myself outside of that and they’re different I focus on the emotions of the song when I’m writing it But just because you listen to a love song it doesn’t mean you’re thinking about the undying emotions of love throughout the 24 hours of the day right”             Yoon Hyunsang competes in the first season of TV channel SBS’s audition program ’Kpop Star to become one of the top seven contestants SBS              It took him two years after appearing on the audition show to debut with his EP “Pianoforte” but when the time came he was more than ready for his entrance onto the music scene          Not only did he write every song on the sixtrack EP himself but the lead track “When would it be” also caught the attention of singer IU— who was also signed at Yoon’s thenagency Loen Entertainment When IU asked if she could have the song to release herself the agency suggested that the two singers duet leading to a collaboration between Yoon and one of the most popular singers in Kpop          Yoon has since been building his repertoire with his own songs that span across a variety of genres including folk ballad and RB “anything except for EDM and hiphop” according to the singer He held his very first solo concert in 2018 and released his single “Mild” in July promising fans that he will be releasing an EP by the end of this year filled with songs that he has of course written himself          His songs are loved for their casual and easygoing mood along with a touch of uniqueness that comes from his oneofakind voice Even with celebrity endorsements from actor Lee Minho and singer Dino of Seventeen Yoon remains humble          The Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with Yoon to delve deeper into his songwriting and who he is outside of music The following are edited excerpts             Singersongwriter Yoon Hyunsang sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily BYUN JUYEON            What made you participate in the audition show “Kpop Star” and become a singer      Since I was younger honestly I wasn’t anything else that I could do except for music From a very young age I just dreamed that one day I would become a singerIt took little time for me to debut after the show but I felt more worried about not being totally ready as a singer rather than not being able to debut straight away It actually gave me time to write songs and see things in a different light in a broader light I think it all helped me           Can you name the three songs that you think will give listeners a good overview of your music      I would recommend “My memory warehouse” “Silhouette” and “Dancing Universe” Oh can I add one more It would also be nice to add the latest release “Mild”I think a lot of people think that singer Yoon Hyunsang only sings slowtempo ballad songs but I’ve been trying to make a variety of music that shows the different colors of who I am I want people to notice that so I’ve chosen these songs which are quite different from each other           The cover of single WAVE 2015 which includes the track Tipsy 20 Blues MOONHWAIN            Do you have a favorite among your songs      I end up listening to a song so many times from the moment I start writing it until it’s done The ones I’ve released recently I listened to so many times that I’m fed up in a way But the one’s that I released in the past I come back to them every now and then I think the songs I wrote in the earlier stages of my career are closer to my heart One of them is called “Tipsy 20 Blues” That one is especially close to my heartThe song starts with the line “The tipsiness walks all over me” At first listen it just feels like a person feels tipsy because of the alcohol But as the song progresses it talks more about the “tipsiness” and how young people feel disoriented with their lives because of the thoughts and dilemmas they come across for the first time It’s about youth and finding my own path We get beaten down by our own thoughts and I tried to show that and it makes it quite meaningful for me           You introduced yourself as “A vocalist with a feel and color” in “Kpop Star” Would you say it differently if you could go back      It is a little embarrassing but I don’t regret it I was 18 back then and I wanted to show people the untamed energy of youth I tend to think that there are certain things that people can do only when they’re a certain age and I think people should do them— do the things you can at that age I didn’t really think I had “feel and color” but I just blurted out whatever came to my mind as a way to make it stick to people’s memoriesI do think I am a “singer with a feel and color” now I was a vocalist aspiring to be a singer back then but at least I have debuted now The only fans I had back then were my family and friends from school— who were all very supportive I might not be a huge star now but I have people who like my music I feel it every moment           Why do you call yourself a small star      My first concert was in 2018 which is quite late considering I debuted in 2014 It was really memorable and I never had to look after myself so thoroughly for two days I even had to quit drinking for a month before the concert and I think that was the hardest time of my life laughsBut I’m not the type to find myself in a slump I think slumps are only allowed for the top stars Personally I think the tough times that we come across before we’ve actually accomplished anything isn’t a slump Is that weird Success is an idea that’s open to interpretation It could be the Billboard charts for someone but for me it’s a singer who can put on concerts frequently— since I haven’t been able to do that especially this year           The cover of Mild released in July MOONHWAIN            How you do write your songs      I start with the big idea I think what’s being conveyed within the song can be someone’s emotions but I think it’s all about the skills of expressing it Just like everyone goes through different breakups and gets different ideas when they think about a breakup I try to find the best expressions to fit the idea I jot down the things that come to my mind but I don’t end up using any of them It feels so cheesy The momentary blurts of emotions are important but not very useful      Who do you think likes your music      I like to think

16,National football teams take draw in 1st exhibition match,"

     The U-23 and the senior Korean national football team congratulate each other after playing to a 2-2- draw during a exhibition match at Goyang Stadium in Gyeonggi on Friday. [YONHAP]               A rare exhibition match between Korea's senior men's national football team and under-23 team ended in a 2-2 draw on Friday.           The young guns nearly got the better of their older counterparts, but senior team striker Lee Jeong-hyeop spoiled that with his 89th-minute equalizer at Goyang Stadium in Goyang, Gyeonggi.            The two teams will go at it again at 8 p.m. Monday at the same stadium. The U-23 squad will be the home team in the second contest.           The U-23 team scored twice in the second half to erase an early 1-0 deficit. Song Min-kyu, in his first national team appearance, made it a 1-1 tie in the 50th minute for the younger squad, and an own goal by the senior team captain, Kwon Kyung-won, put the U-23 side ahead.           The aggregate score will determine the winner, with the away goal rule in effect. In case of a tie after two matches, the teams will go to a penalty shootout, without playing extra periods.           The winning team will donate 100 million won ($87,370) in its name to aid the country's fight against the coronavirus.           The Korea Football Association (KFA) organized these matches to give fans a long-awaited glimpse of their national teams and also allow coaches — Paulo Bento for the senior team and Kim Hak-bum for the U-23 side — to test potential candidates for future competitions.           Bento's team hasn't played any international matches this year, due to effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. They would have completed the second round of the Asian qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup this year. Their last official competition was in December last year.           Kim's U-23 team qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by winning the Asian qualifying tournament in January, but the Olympic Games have been postponed by a year because of the pandemic. The U-23 team hasn't had any official matches since January.           Because of the 14-day quarantine required for all inbound travelers to Korea, overseas-based stars were not selected for these exhibition matches. The 23-man rosters for the two sides are entirely made up of players from the domestic K League.           Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors defender Lee Ju-yong opened the scoring for Bento's team in the 14th minute. He was left wide open when he took a pass on the left wing, and he cut to the center of the box and fired a shot past defender Yoon Jong-gyu and into the net.           The U-23 squad had some promising moments in the first half, with Song's header off a Yoon Jong-gyu cross going right at goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo.           Song, the 21-year-old Pohang Steelers forward, broke through five minutes into the second half with some great individual effort. After taking control of the ball just outside the box, Song charged in and danced past three defenders before firing a left-footed shot past Jo for a 1-1 tie.           Song is tied for most goals by a Korean player in the K League 1 this season with 10.           Eight minutes later, the U-23 team took the lead with some fortuitous bounces.           Jo made a spectacular save on Cho Young-wook's shot, and Cho Gue-sung got the rebound on the left side and headed the ball toward the middle. The attempted pass pinballed off the leg of defender Kwon, the right goal post and Kwon's knee again on its way into the net.           The senior team generated few scoring chances the rest of the way. The U-23 nearly took a 3-1 lead in the 81st minute, when Um Won-sang, after a pretty give-and-go play with Oh Se-hun, fired a shot from the right side and forced Jo to make a difficult save.           They would rue that missed opportunity, as a pair of second-half subs for the senior side connected for a late game-tying goal.           On a rare counterattack chance in the 89th minute, midfielder Kim In-sung charged toward the net up the middle and found Lee Jeong-hyeop to his right. The striker for Busan IPark made no mistake with his low shot past diving goalkeeper Song Bum-keun.           The goal saved face for Bento's team, who got outplayed for most of the second half.           Though the U-23 players more than held their own against veterans, coach Kim said his squad barely deserved a passing grade for their performance.           ""We didn't execute most of what we'd planned to do, and I don't know if I can even give them 50 out of 100 points. I am going to give them an earful,"" Kim said. ""We needed to be faster on the attack.""           Kim was also stingy with his praise for Song, the lone goal scorer for his team.           ""He did score that goal, but he didn't look in sync with the rest of the team at times,"" the coach said. ""I think he put a lot of pressure on himself because this was his first national team match. I think he should be better in the next match.""           Bento declined to assess his team's performance on the spot, only saying he'd need to talk to individual players over what they did well and where they need to improve.           Bento picked three players from the U-23 talent pool, and two of them, Won Du-jae and Lee Dong-gyeong, were in the starting lineup. Won, normally a defensive midfielder for Ulsan Hyundai FC, started as a centerback and performed admirably, showing exactly the kind of versatility that intrigued Bento in the first place.           ""Won had an impressive first half but he was a bit inconsistent in the second half,"" Bento said. ""I think he was shaken up after allowing the equalizer. But I understand that because it comes from his lack of experience.”           Yonhap   ",     The U23 and the senior Korean national football team congratulate each other after playing to a 22 draw

19,[REVIEW] LG U+ AR glasses really can put 'Blackpink in your area',"

     This computer-generated mock-up shows an actual screenshot from LG U+'s U+ Real Glass AR glasses superimposed on an image of the reporter using the glasses at the Korea JoongAng Daily office in western Seoul on Oct. 7. [JEON TAE-GYU/YUN YOUNG]               Augmented reality (AR) promises to provide a simultaneous view of both the physical and digital worlds, allowing users to immerse themselves in virtual experiences without having to check out of the real world.           After the brief excitement surrounding Google's Google Glass back in 2013, AR glasses have disappeared into the industrial world, offering business solutions but nothing for the average consumer. A new set of AR glasses sold by mobile carrier LG U+ and manufactured by Beijing-based developer Nreal is the first serious effort to bring AR hardware to the mainstream in Korea.           The launch of the headset, which went on sale in August for 699,000 won ($604), could serve as a critical test for AR glasses as a concept, as it is the world’s first mass-produced AR glasses designed entirely for consumers. The first batch of 1,000 U+ Real Glass units sold out within one month of the initial release.           To experience everything the device has to offer, the Korea JoongAng Daily paired the glasses with a Samsung Galaxy Note20 with 5G turned on so that data speeds and lagging were not a concern.               First look          One of the biggest issues AR glasses face is looks. An ugly phone or unsightly smart watch might not be ideal, but it's easy to ignore. AR glasses are going on your face.           The U+ Real Glass is not as clunky as a virtual reality headset or other existing industrial AR glasses, but it definitely is an acquired taste. Put simply, nobody is going to miss the fact that you're not wearing a normal pair of glasses.           Weighing just 88 grams (3 ounces), the glasses aren't heavy, but they are still chunky with a large plastic rim across the top housing three cameras and multiple sensors, looking more like a bulky pair of goggles than chic sunglasses.           The glasses' relatively compact design is possible because it uses a smartphone as a controller, removing the need for batteries, a modem and processing unit in the glasses. But the payoff is pretty huge: A physical cable runs from the arm of the glasses to the smartphone.           The design certainly isn't perfect, but it is promising. The glasses may not look the part yet — and the thick cable running to the phone feels very outdated — but Nreal is clearly already thinking about how to make it as compact as possible and that will only improve with time.                               Painful pointing          Before we dig into the image quality and the content consumption experience with the Real Glass, a more fundamental issue needs to be addressed.           The device is controlled by moving the smartphone around in the air to control a pointer visible in AR. The smartphone interface also includes buttons to zoom, recenter the display, lock it to a specific position and a large square that the user can use like a laptop touchpad.           But that system is far from perfect. It regularly didn't work, the pointer disappeared, the display jumped round and disappeared from view and the zoom button never really did anything.           The home screen shows a line of apps rearranged vertically across the user's field of view, but that was the only thing that really seemed to have been customized for the glasses. Open any app and it appears as a horizontal rectangular box like a phone screen floating in midair.           Once you've got past all that, however, the U+ Real Glass starts to come into its own. Both YouTube and some AR games can be expanded to ""full screen"" mode, offering a much broader view of the content.           To test this out, we chose a music video from girl group Blackpink.           Choosing the song wasn't easy. When navigating the YouTube app, it's still a small rectangular box. Typing in ""Blackpink"" was possible on the smartphone's display, but scrolling down the list wasn't easy. We were aiming for ""Ddu-du Ddu-du,"" but ended up settling for ""Kill This Love.""                Augmented reality display          Once you've got Blackpink playing (other music videos are available), the result is pretty satisfactory. The OLED display definitely has room to improve from the current 1,080 pixels, but it still looks good. In a dark room, detail is easy to see, although the bright light can really ruin the visual.           The field of view is relatively narrow, at 52 degrees, so it's not an especially immersive experience. But again, the potential is clearly there.             LG U+ is currently working on a range of applications to take advantage of the AR functions. Currently there is only one option, which displays videos from multiple angles, but as more content is rolled out the technology will continue to develop.           Streaming of the customized content hinted at what the future of AR glasses could deliver — hologram-like content that responds as the user moves. LG U+ isn't quite there yet, but it has taken a step in the right direction.           BY PARK EUN-JEE, JIM BULLEY   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleLG U+ market tests 5G AR

20,BTS feels the love during its second online concert ,"

     BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               The question that has been lingering on everyone’s minds since musicians first began holding online concerts earlier this year is how can such a format provide a different and enjoyable experience? With its latest online concert held this weekend, BTS provided the answer.           BTS held its online concert “BTS Map of the Soul ON:E” on Saturday and Sunday, which was streamed live across the world. It marked the band’s first concert in four months since “Bang Bang Con The Live” was held in June, its second-ever online concert that required a ticket purchase. The concert was initially planned as a two-way event, which would see some fans come to the offline concert while others could access the streamed version online, but the unexpected surge in coronavirus infections in the greater Seoul area that came in mid-August put an end to that plan and only online viewing was available.           BTS is known for its extraordinary music and performances, so it came as no big surprise that the concert would also awe the audience. But there is one particular reason why the “ON:E” concert, which is shortened for “ONline Edition” according to the band’s agency Big Hit Entertainment, exceeded expectations and set a new standard of possibility for the entire music industry — it showed how an online concert can entertain viewers in different ways than an offline concert.              BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]       Fans’ faces are turned into floating cubes to fill the arena during the performance of ’We are Bulletproof: the Eternal“ on Saturday during the ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ concert. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               Since earlier this year, multiple K-pop bands have been holding online concerts to substitute for the loss of opportunity to perform on offline stages due to the coronavirus pandemic. While each concert strived to entertain the viewers in the best ways it could, many — if not all — focused on the fact that the format was digital. Various digital technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and extended reality (XR) were used to make the stage look bigger and fancier, with more colors and attractions than offline concerts.           While BTS’s “ON:E” concerts still used such digital technology — and very well too, especially at the last stage of “We are Bulletproof: the Eternal” where fans’ faces were turned into floating cubes to fill the arena — one performance showed the greatest possible potential for an online concert without using any AR or XR. Instead, it focused on the fact that the camera could fill the whole screen even from a small space.              Suga performs his solo song ""Interlude: Shadow"" (2020) during BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]       Suga performs his solo song ""Interlude: Shadow"" (2020) during BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               A solo stage performance by member Suga, who sang his song “Interlude: Shadow” (2020), was kicked off from a small hallway filled with fog and dim lighting. As the song proceeded, he walked out toward the camera and multiple hands started pushing inwards toward Suga, much like the image used by multimedia artist Yiyun Kang for her video installation “Beyond the Scene” created earlier this year as a part of the contemporary art project “CONNECT, BTS.” Suga walked out of the narrow hallway to the stage, which was also surrounded by digital LED screens and floors that also had the image of handprints pushing toward the stage.           There was no huge AR graphic to exaggerate the extent of the stage, but it was a performance only made possible by taking advantage of the fact that the whole scene didn’t have to be visible to everyone seated in the audience — it just had to be visible to the camera. It was the perfect trinity of art, music and digital technology realized at its finest.              BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday allows viewers to toggle through multiple angles through the multi-view service. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]       Jimin performs a dance solo during BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               The command of camerawork, leaping flawlessly from performance to pre-recorded videos and vice versa, also heightened the quality of the viewing experience. Jimin’s dance solo after “Black Swan” that was immediately followed by a video of the band was so impeccable that it felt like part of the band’s performance.           According to Big Hit Entertainment, it took the agency eight times more production fees compared to the band’s last online concert “Bang Bang Con The Live.” Four large-size stages were decorated in different ways “to best show BTS’s performance.” The multi-view service allowed viewers to toggle through different angles during the concert, which may need some work until the switch becomes 100 percent delay-free, but was still a meaningful function for fans.              BTS performs its latest hit ""Dynamite"" against an LED screen with fans' faces during its second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]       Jimin sheds tears while sharing his thoughts on the concert and the coronavirus during BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               Topping off the concert was, as always, BTS’s sincerity — the apex of which came during the last talk session when member Jimin shed tears while sharing his thoughts in front of the LED screens showing the faces of fan club ARMY members from all around the world.           “It felt so unfair,” said Jimin, trying to hold his tears in. “When the coronavirus broke out, I didn’t know why I had to go through all this. Why? All I wanted to do was just go outside, have fun with the members while performing and share that with you. When I saw the members having so much fun during the encore, I just couldn’t concentrate anymore.”           When Jimin couldn’t hold his tears back anymore and started to cry, fans also began crying with him on the screen. He wept briefly, then gathered himself to thank the fans.           “I’m sorry that we didn’t get to show you everything that we prepared for today. But really, your hope got through to us. We don’t know if our hearts are with you, but I hope they are. I thank you ARMY so much for always supporting us and embracing us,” said Jimin.              BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday features fans' faces streamed live on the LED screen. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               Unlike the “Bang Bang Con” concert, the “ON:E” concert showed the faces of fans on screen for the first time. Fans communicated through the online chat box for the last concert, but seeing people’s faces definitely changed everything, according to Jin.           “Honestly, I didn’t feel like this was a concert before today,” said Jin. “We’ve worked on a lot of promotions so far, with ‘ON’ and 'Dynamite’ and so on. Even when we were rehearsing today, it just felt like a part of a promotion. But I saw the faces of ARMY holding their ARMY bombs [light sticks] on the screen, it finally made me feel like I was with you all. It made me so happy and made me think of something that a senior musician once said. They said, ‘If you set foot on stage and feel the fans’ love, there’s no going back.’ And today, I truly feel what they meant.”              BTS's second online concert ’BTS Map of the Soul ON:E“ held on Saturday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               BTS is readying itself for the release of another album “BE” to come on Nov. 20. With Covid-19 keeping fans at home and making travel difficult, BTS urged everyone to stay strong and adamant.           “For anyone abroad, for people everywhere out there; we are literally strong,” said RM in English for the global fans.           “The ARMY I know and the BTS you all know, we're all strong. We'll find a way, we always have. If there's no way then let's draw the map, the whole map again. So no worries. We're strong and we’re still connected. And even [in our] ways come catastrophe [like], windfall, snowfall, rainfall, anything — let’s not just stop to believe.

[PARK SANG-MOON]         In this unusual age of social distancing around the globe, Spain is hoping to shorten the distance with its partner in Asia as they celebrate their 70th anniversary in ties this year.           “Spain and Korea have great and excellent relations, but not intense enough — we have so much potential to do more in every field, be it political dialogue, trade, cultural exchanges or tourism,” said Juan Ignacio Morro, ambassador of Spain to Korea, in an interview at his residence on Tuesday. “The pandemic has only proven that the world is that much more connected, that the world is so much smaller than before.”           Spain and Korea signed their bilateral ties on March 17, 1950.             Circumstances at home engrossed much of their attention in the early decades of their relations — of which the Korean War (1950-1953), the transition from dictatorships to democracy in the 1970s and ‘80s and economic recessions were but a few.            “It wasn’t until the early 2000s that Spain started seeing Korea as a strategic partner in Asia,” wrote Chun Hong-jo, Korean ambassador to Spain, in a special commemorative book on bilateral ties published by the Korean and Spanish governments last month. “By 2008, when the first G-20 summit took place, both Korea and Spain saw each other as the best, like-minded partners sharing common values on democracy, human rights, rule of law, market economy and multilateralism.”           More recently, Korea signed an FTA with the European Union in 2010, and since then, its trade with Spain has expanded, hitting 5.3 billion euros ($6.2 billion) last year.           The number of Korean tourists to Spain has grown exponentially in the past decade, reaching some 630,000 in 2019, according to the Spanish Embassy in Seoul.           It was also last year that Korea welcomed the royal visit of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia. The previous royal visit from Spain to Korea was in 1996.            The Covid-19 pandemic earlier in this year has brought disruptions to the diplomatic activities, but it has also led to different windows of opportunities.           Picking up a new language, for instance, has been one of the popular ways people have opted to use their newfound time from the absence of their usual list of activities.           “Spanish is being taught at 16 universities in Korea,” Morro said. “But there is so much more potential for growth in the Spanish language programs here, given that it is spoken by more than 550 million people and is the official language spoken in 21 countries.""           The embassy is working on bringing the Cervantes Institute, Spain’s public institution on Spanish language and culture, to Seoul soon.           “The halt in activities brought on by the pandemic is pushing both Spain and Korea to expand one's boundaries, to intensify the existing relations and to find new ways to cooperate,” Morro said. “The time is ripe for a turning point in the bilateral relations, and the royal visit last year was just the beginning.”           Ambassador Morro recalled highlights in the past 70 years of friendship between Spain and Korea and his hopes for the next milestones to come. The following are edited excerpts of the interview.              President Moon Jae-in, right, and King Felipe VI at the Blue House in October 2019. [EMBASSY OF SPAIN IN KOREA]             In celebrating 70 years of diplomatic relations between Korea and Spain, where do you see the most potential for growth in bilateral cooperation? Tourism, trade and investment and education and language would be amongst those at the top of the list. Tourism is a very important issue for Spain. We are No. 2 in the world in terms of income earned from tourism and also in terms of the number of tourists received in the country. In 2019, we welcomed 83 million tourists in the nation, and income in the tourism sector generated about 12 percent of our GDP.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, we were also seeing some very exciting growth in tourists from Korea. We had about 25,000 Korean tourists in Spain in 2008. This number grew to half a million by 2018. Then within a year, they grew to 630,000. Spain, a tourist destination especially during the summer, is suffering from a second wave of Covid-19 cases but we believe the situation will stabilize soon. What I’d like to emphasize here is that all the infrastructure on tourism are all intact. It means that sans the viral outbreak, we can pick things back up in no time.       What areas of trade and investment are most important to Spain-Korea cooperation? As of late, we saw an increase in the trade of goods in the defense industry, such as the four Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport that Korea bought from Spain in 2018 and 2019. Every year there is more stable trade in car components, gastronomy, including wine, oil and pork, and also in design and fashion as well as in intermediary machinery.It’s worth noting that both Spain and Korea have excellent records on construction and infrastructure projects. There are around 56 multinational projects that Spain and Korea have taken on together in 17 countries. They include projects on highways and mines in Australia, subway construction in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, oil refinery in Kuwait, as well as other projects in Peru and Turkey. Korea’s Kotra [Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency] and Spain’s ICEX [Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade] have also been working together to provide competitive investment opportunities.       What does “strategic partnership” between Spain and Korea mean in simpler terms? It means having a solid relation and confidence in sharing political views openly based on common positions. Your opinions are important for us in regions where we may not be experts. And vice versa. Korea is a leader in Asia. I was stationed in Korea as a cultural affairs officer from 1994 to 1997, during the Kim Young-sam administration. Korea by that time was already growing to be a great power. Today you are a leader in the tech industry and you have also proven that you can guide the world in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak. You are present in the multilateral meetings and are respected by a lot of countries. The invitation for Korea to join the next G7 summit is just one example.Spain has a very high profile as well. We are interested in working closely with Asia and we believe that with Korea, a like-minded partner that respects democratic values, we have almost no issue where we would not be seeing eye-to-eye. We understand that Korea is interested in opportunities to partner with Latin America. That is where we would be able to share our experiences and knowledge. Spain can be Korea’s gateway to Latin America, and Korea Spain’s gateway to Asia.      President Moon Jae-in, right, and King Felipe VI at the Blue House in October 2019. They are followed by Queen Letizia and First Lady Kim Jung-sook.[EMBASSY OF SPAIN IN KOREA]             The Covid situation has reduced most diplomatic events. Oct. 12 is a national holiday in Spain. How will it be celebrated differently this year? Due to the pandemic, we will not be hosting a celebration to the usual scale. But we are organizing an event to present the special 70th anniversary book put together by the governments of Spain and Korea and the Spanish Centre for Korean Research.       The pandemic has also put a standstill to the people-to-people exchanges, the heart of public diplomacy. Please share any anecdotes of Spanish individuals in Korea that may be representative of the bilateral friendship. When I was here in Korea 25 years ago, I met Padre Jesus Molero. I had very good relations with him. He came to Korea after the war. He found the country devastated. He dedicated the rest of his life here to help the Korean people, and to his end he loved the Korean people. He died in 2018, just a few months before I returned to Korea.Another Spanish person who dedicated his life to Korea was Padre Jose Maria Blanco. He came in 1962. He told me that much of the country was still in a difficult place when he arrived. Whenever he spoke of Korea, you could tell he was very proud of how much Korea had achieved.It’s been a tradition for Spanish Catholics to provide their services wherever they were needed, even in regions far away from home. That explains how even in as early as the 16th century, there were Spanish priests in Korea. In fact, the visit by the first Spanish priest to Korea — Gregorio de Céspedes in 1593 — was the first time ever that a European had landed in Korea, according to the historical records.         BY

22,North unveils array of new weapons during military parade ,"

     A new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) paraded on an 11-wheeled transporter erector launcher during a military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square on Saturday, the 75th anniversary of the North's ruling Workers' Party. [YONHAP]               North Korea unveiled an intimidating array of new weapons at a monumental military parade carried out in the dead of night on Saturday — among them novel forms of ballistic missiles capable of being launched from a submarine and across the Pacific Ocean.            The parade, which intelligence officials in Seoul said went on from 12 to 3 a.m. Saturday in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square, was the result of months of preparations by the regime for the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party, undertaken amid one of the worst economic situations the country has faced in decades.             Footage of the ceremony broadcast by the Korean Central Television Saturday evening showed on display a host of new strategic weapons the regime had been developing for years, including what appeared to be a short-range ballistic missile system known as the KN-23, a 600-mililmeter large caliber artillery gun and a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) labeled as the Pukkuksong-4A.           The centerpiece of the event was a new form of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that appeared to be an enhanced and larger version of Pyongyang’s Hwasong-15 system — a weapon reportedly capable of reaching the continental United States.             The public debut of the arsenal signaled to Washington, months into a fraught stalemate in their denuclearization negotiations, that Pyongyang’s priority remained to ensure the survival of its regime by any means possible.               That intent was made unequivocal in an address ahead of the parade from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who announced he had built a war deterrent capable of containing threats from hostile powers, but that the North would never employ such means first without provocation.                North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, center, delivers a speech at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang at a military parade to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the ruling Workers' Party Saturday.

23,YouTuber tax reports show sponsorship is where the money is,"

     [SHUTTERSTOCK]               The average monthly salary of YouTubers in 2019 was 9.34 million won ($8,041), three times the average for a regular office worker in Korea. A majority of that income came from corporate sponsorships, not from advertising on the platform.             The National Tax Service (NTS) on Tuesday submitted a report to the office of Rep. Bak Hong-geun from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) regarding the registration status of new content creators on YouTube and their income in 2019. This is the first time that revenue specifics have been disclosed.            The NTS last September created a new industry code for YouTubers and started to receive registrations, leading to the disclosure of their revenue.           Currently, there are 691 people who have registered their YouTube content creation businesses with the NTS, 330 of whom reported their income.           Total revenue from July to December amounted to 18.49 billion won, which translates to 9.33 million won in monthly salary per YouTuber. This is around three times the average monthly salary of regular office workers last year, which was 3.04 million won.          Sponsorship took up more than half of the YouTubers’ income. Based on analysis from Bak’s office, Google’s AdSense made up 40 percent of total revenue. The remaining 60 percent was from other sources, such as sponsorship deals.           Revenue from sponsorship is also directly related to the issue of “backdoor online advertising,” which recently became an issue after several YouTubers and social media influencers were found to be promoting products in their videos without notifying the viewers of their business ties with corporate sponsors. The Fair Trade Commission last month implemented an amendment to outlaw the practice.             While the NTS accepts business registrations and income reports from YouTubers, only a minority of influencers actually report to the NTS. According to Bak’s office, there are 4,379 YouTubers in Korea with over 100,000 subscribers to their channels. Among them, 55 percent, or 2,387, were registered as independent businesses as of August.           “The YouTube market is rapidly growing, but a majority of participants are a blind spot for tax evasion,” said Bak.            “Taxation officials should actively encourage YouTubers to report their incomes, so that internationally transferred advertisement revenues and sponsorships, which were brought to light during the recent controversy, all get counted for calculating tax.""           BY CHO HYUN-SOOK   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   ",     SHUTTERSTOCK              The average monthly salary of YouTubers in 2019 was 934 million won 8041 three times the average for a regular office worker in Korea A majority of that income came from corporate sponsorships not from advertising on the platform          The National Tax Service NTS on Tuesday submitted a report to the office of Rep Bak Honggeun from the ruling Democratic Party DP regarding the registration status of new content creators on YouTube and their income in 2019 This is the first time that revenue specifics have been disclosed          The NTS last September created a new industry code for YouTubers and started to receive registrations leading to the disclosure of their revenue          Currently there are 691 people who have registered their YouTube content creation businesses with the NTS 330 of whom reported their income          Total revenue from July to December amounted to 1849 billion won which translates to 933 million won in monthly salary per YouTuber This is around three times the average monthly salary of regular office workers last year which was 304 million won         Sponsorship took up more than half of the YouTubers’ income Based on analysis from Bak’s office Google’s AdSense made up 40 percent of total revenue The remaining 60 percent was from other sources such as sponsorship deals         Revenue from sponsorship is also directly related to the issue of “backdoor online advertising” which recently became an issue after several YouTubers and social media influencers were found to be promoting products in their videos without notifying the viewers of their business ties with corporate sponsors The Fair Trade Commission last month implemented an amendment to outlaw the practice           While the NTS accepts business registrations and income reports from YouTubers only a minority of influencers actually report to the NTS According to Bak’s office there are 4379 YouTubers in Korea with over 100000 subscribers to their channels Among them 55 percent or 2387 were registered as independent businesses as of August          “The YouTube market is rapidly growing but a majority of participants are a blind spot for tax evasion” said Bak          “Taxation officials should actively encourage YouTubers to report their incomes so that internationally transferred advertisement revenues and sponsorships which were brought to light during the recent controversy all get counted for calculating tax          BY CHO HYUNSOOK leejeeyoung1joongangcokr   
24,Moon's ex-aide denies testimony that he took a bribe,"

     Kang Ki-jung, former senior presidential secretary for political affairs. [YONHAP]                A former political aide of President Moon Jae-in denied court testimony that he took a bribe in a massive financial scandal.             In a Facebook post, Kang Ki-jung, Moon's senior secretary for political affairs from January 2019 till August 2020, said he is planning legal action against Kim Bong-hyun, former chairman of Star Mobility and a primary suspect in a financial fraud that effectively brought down Korea's largest hedge fund, Lime Asset Management.           Kang said Kim’s testimony in a trial hearing on Thursday was both perjury and defaming of him.           On Thursday, Kim took the witness stand in a trial of Lee Kang-se, a journalist hired as Star Mobility CEO to lobby the government, who is being tried for bribery and embezzlement. Kim testified that he had paid 50 million won ($44,000) to Kang through Lee.           “In July last year, Lee said he would make the delivery to Kang, who was the senior presidential secretary for political affairs at the time,” Kim testified. “I put 50 million won [in cash] inside a shopping bag and gave it to Lee. Lee said his meeting went well, so I took it that the bribe had been delivered smoothly.”           Although Kim said Thursday that he had bribed Kang through Lee, Lee has denied the charge. In an earlier session of his trial, Lee said he had met Kang but never delivered any money from Kim.            A former president of Gwangju MBC, Lee was CEO of Kim’s Star Mobility. He was suspected of having arranged connections between Lime and top politicians and officials in the Moon administration.

25,Posco Energy sues U.S. fuel-cell partner,"

     Posco Energy's fuel-cell factory site in Pohang, North Gyeongsang. [POSCO ENERGY]         Posco Energy sued U.S. partner FuelCell Energy (FCE) in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), claiming $800 million in damages, the company said Friday.           A wholly owned subsidiary of steel giant Posco, Posco Energy is Korea’s largest private electricity supplier. Since the late 2000s, the company has been developing hydrogen fuel cells as a future growth engine.           FuelCell Energy had been a partner in that drive for more than a decade. In 2007, the two companies signed an agreement in which Posco Energy purchased shares of the U.S. firm and obtained a license that gave it access to FuelCell’s Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) technology.           In 2016, the two companies decided to establish a joint venture in fuel-cell batteries. But according to Posco Energy, little progress was made in the past four years as the U.S. partner had been “uncooperative.”           In June, FCE filed suit in the ICC requesting revocation of the license deal and damages of $200 million for Posco Energy violating contract terms.           Posco Energy denied that allegation and slammed FCE’s revocation request as “one-sided.""           “The joint venture was an important step in our effort to normalize the fuel-cell business,” the company said in a statement. “The plan was to cooperate with FCE in technology and supply networks. But despite having agreed in the memorandum of understanding, [FCE] suddenly launched a legal suit.”           Posco Energy claims FCE’s move is an intentional gambit to do business directly in Korea, which now has one of the largest fuel cell markets in the world. Under the original license, Posco Energy was given exclusive rights to FCE’s MCFC technology in Asian markets until 2023.           Posco and FCE, in fact, have been fighting and reconciling throughout their relationship. A major issue occurred when core components supplied by FCE were found to be faulty, causing defects in Posco's fuel-cell batteries.           The Korean company says this led to lost market share and costs. From 2014 to 2017, losses in its fuel-cell business increased from 44.7 billion won ($39 million) to 64.5 billion won.           Some $800 million in damages were the result of FCE’s faulty components and FCE’s failure to fulfill contractual duties, Posco Energy said.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   ",     Posco Energys fuelcell factory site in Pohang North Gyeongsang POSCO ENERGY         Posco Energy sued US partner FuelCell Energy FCE in the International Chamber of Commerce ICC claiming 800 million in damages the company said Friday          A wholly owned subsidiary of steel giant Posco Posco Energy is Korea’s largest private electricity supplier Since the late 2000s the company has been developing hydrogen fuel cells as a future growth engine          FuelCell Energy had been a partner in that drive for more than a decade In 2007 the two companies signed an agreement in which Posco Energy purchased shares of the US firm and obtained a license that gave it access to FuelCell’s Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell MCFC technology          In 2016 the two companies decided to establish a joint venture in fuelcell batteries But according to Posco Energy little progress was made in the past four years as the US partner had been “uncooperative”          In June FCE filed suit in the ICC requesting revocation of the license deal and damages of 200 million for Posco Energy violating contract terms          Posco Energy denied that allegation and slammed FCE’s revocation request as “onesided          “The joint venture was an important step in our effort to normalize the fuelcell business” the company said in a statement “The plan was to cooperate with FCE in technology and supply networks But despite having agreed in the memorandum of understanding FCE suddenly launched a legal suit”          Posco Energy claims FCE’s move is an intentional gambit to do business directly in Korea which now has one of the largest fuel cell markets in the world Under the original license Posco Energy was given exclusive rights to FCE’s MCFC technology in Asian marketsuntil 2023          Posco and FCE in fact have been fighting and reconciling throughout their relationship A majorissue occurred when core components supplied by FCE were found to be faulty causing defects in Poscos fuelcell batteries          The Korean company says this led to lost market share and costs From 2014 to 2017 losses in its fuelcell business increased from 447 billion won 39 million to 645 billion won          Some 800 million in damages were the result of FCE’s faulty components and FCE’s failure to fulfill contractual duties Posco Energy said          BY SONG KYOUNGSON songkyoungsonjoongangcokr   
26,African swine fever infects pig farm in Gangwon,"

     A government official blocks the entrance to a pig farm in Hwacheon County, Gangwon, after pigs supplied from this region were found infected by African swine fever on Friday. [YONHAP]               The government decided to cull around 2,500 pigs in Hwacheon County, Gangwon, after confirming cases of African swine fever (ASF) on Friday.           This was the first time in a year that the disease was found in farm pigs.           According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, three female pigs were found dead in a slaughterhouse in Cheorwon County, Gangwon, on Thursday, all of which were later confirmed to have been infected by the disease. They were among eight pigs from the Hwacheon pig farm.           Upon confirming ASF in the pigs, the government decided to cull all 945 pigs on the farm that supplied them and an additional 1,525 from two farms located within 10 kilometers (6 miles). ASF currently has no known cure and culling is the only way to prevent its spread.           The government also ordered a 48-hour lockdown on pig farms, slaughterhouses, feed factories and vehicles working at such facilities in Gangwon and Gyeonggi until Sunday 5 a.m.           Wild boars had been affected by the ASF in Hwacheon, but this was the first time pigs on farms were affected. The farm that supplied the three dead pigs was only 250 meters (820 feet) away from the point where wild boars were found with ASF.           In the county, around 290 wild boar carcasses have been found with infections so far.           “Hwacheon was a region where an outbreak was likely,” said Ahn Jae-wan, a ministry official in ASF prevention for Gangwon. ""The latest infection came despite our prevention efforts like installing fences and capturing wild boars.""           After the first outbreak in Paju, Gyeonggi, in September 2019, more than 430,000 pigs were culled to prevent the spread of ASF. Thinking the disease had died down, the Agriculture Ministry was starting to ease regulations regarding pig farms. On Aug. 9, farms that had culled pigs due to the ASF outbreak in Gyeonggi and Gangwon were allowed to restart taking in new pigs. That was halted indefinitely on Friday.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   ",     A government official blocks the entrance to a pig farm in Hwacheon County Gangwon after pigs supplied from this region were found infected by African swine fever on Friday YONHAP              The government decided to cull around 2500 pigs in Hwacheon County Gangwon after confirming cases of African swine fever ASF on Friday          This was the first time in a year that the disease was found in farm pigs          According to the Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs three female pigs were found dead in a slaughterhouse in Cheorwon County Gangwon on Thursday all of which were later confirmed to have been infected by the disease They were among eight pigs from the Hwacheon pig farm          Upon confirming ASF in the pigs the government decided to cull all 945 pigs on the farm that supplied them and an additional 1525 from two farms located within 10 kilometers 6 miles ASF currently has no known cure and culling is the only way to prevent its spread          The government also ordered a 48hour lockdown on pig farms slaughterhouses feed factories and vehicles working at such facilities in Gangwon and Gyeonggi until Sunday 5 am          Wild boars had been affected by the ASF in Hwacheon but this was the first time pigs on farms were affected The farm that supplied the three dead pigs was only 250 meters 820 feet away from the point where wild boars were found with ASF          In the county around 290 wild boar carcasses have been found with infections so far          “Hwacheon was a region where an outbreak was likely” said Ahn Jaewan a ministry official in ASF prevention for Gangwon The latest infection came despite our prevention efforts like installing fences and capturing wild boars          After the first outbreak in Paju Gyeonggi in September 2019 more than 430000 pigs were culled to prevent the spread of ASF Thinking the disease had died down the Agriculture Ministry was starting to ease regulations regarding pig farms On Aug 9 farms that had culled pigs due to the ASF outbreak in Gyeonggi and Gangwon were allowed to restart taking in new pigs That was halted indefinitely on Friday          BY SONG KYOUNGSON songkyoungsonjoongangcokr   
27,Blaze at Ulsan tower takes 14 hours to control,"

     The Samhwan Art Nouveau building in Ulsan is ablaze on Friday. The fire broke out late Thursday night and it took more than 14 hours to control. [YONHAP]                A massive fire at a high-rise apartment building in Ulsan was controlled after more than 14 hours. No casualty was reported.           According to the Ulsan Fire Department, flames were first reported at the Samhwan Art Nouveau building in the city’s Nam District around 11:07 p.m. The 33-story building has commercial space and 127 apartments.             “As of 12:35 p.m. of Friday, we managed to put out major flames,” a spokesperson for the department announced.           Shortly after the fire began, strong winds helped it spread. Nearly 500 firefighters and 60 vehicles were mobilized to extinguish the blaze initially.           Firefighters struggled throughout Thursday night and flames spread to the top floors. Ulsan does not have a fire engine with a ladder longer than 70 meters (230 feet), so 89 vehicles and 272 firefighters from Busan, Daegu, Changwon and other areas of South and North Gyeongsang provinces were sent to the site.           Later, four helicopters were mobilized, allowing firefighters to enter the building.           During the first hours of the fire, hundreds of people evacuated the building. The fire authorities rescued 77, including some who escaped to the rooftop.             As of 10 a.m. Friday, no casualty was reported. According to the Ulsan Fire Department, 88 people were sent to nearby hospitals for treatment for smoke inhalation or other minor injuries.             Interior and Safety Minister Chin Young traveled from Seoul and arrived at the site around 8:20 a.m. Friday to oversee the firefighting operation.           The Ulsan Metropolitan Police Agency said Friday it created a special team to probe the cause of the fire. A 40-member team will investigate with the fire department and the National Forensic Service.           A separate team of 10 police offers were formed to support victims.           BY SER MYO-JA, BAE JAE-SUNG   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   ",     The Samhwan Art Nouveau building in Ulsan is ablaze on Friday The fire broke out late Thursday night and it took more than 14 hours to control YONHAP               A massive fire at a highrise apartment building in Ulsan was controlled after more than 14 hours No casualty was reported          According to the Ulsan Fire Department flames were first reported at the Samhwan Art Nouveau building in the city’s Nam District around 1107 pmThe 33story building has commercial space and 127 apartments          “As of 1235 pm of Friday we managed to put out major flames” a spokesperson for the department announced          Shortly after the fire began strong winds helped it spread Nearly 500 firefighters and 60 vehicles were mobilized to extinguish the blaze initially          Firefighters struggled throughout Thursday night and flames spread to the top floors Ulsan does not have a fire engine with a ladder longer than 70 meters 230 feet so 89 vehicles and 272 firefighters from Busan Daegu Changwon and other areas of South and North Gyeongsang provinces were sent to the site          Later four helicopters were mobilized allowing firefighters to enter the building          During the first hours of the fire hundreds of people evacuated the building The fire authorities rescued 77 including some who escaped to the rooftop           As of 10 am Friday no casualty was reported According to the Ulsan Fire Department 88 people were sent to nearby hospitals for treatment for smoke inhalation or other minor injuries           Interior and Safety Minister Chin Young traveled from Seoul and arrived at the site around 820 am Friday to oversee the firefighting operation          The Ulsan Metropolitan Police Agency said Friday it created a special team to probe the cause of the fire A 40member team will investigate with the fire department and the National Forensic Service          A separate team of 10 police offers were formed to support victims          BY SER MYOJA BAE JAESUNG  sermyojajoongangcokr

29,Crime rates rise as Covid-19 pandemic spreads,"

                  As the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic continues, the number of crimes reported involving theft of food and household items or attempts to use counterfeit money have shot up.           A 40-year-old was caught trying to illegally enter a restaurant in Cheonan, South Chungcheong, after robbing 11 stores. Despite the crime spree, the things the man stole were only worth between 10,000 won ($8.50) and 70,000 won.           A 50-year-old was recently caught by the police after climbing up a utility pole to cut the wires and sell them to a junk yard.           The court in early August sentenced him to two and a half years in prison.           The judge, while noting that the recent crime was committed out of desperation, said the heavy sentence was handed down because the man had prior convictions and committed the crime when he should have been reflecting on the crimes he had committed in the past.           Also in August, a 70-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman were caught by police trying to steal napa cabbages from a farm in Pyeongchang, Gangwon.           The surge in petty crimes is clear in the quarterly crime report released by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office.           The report showed that in the first quarter of this year, overall crime rose 5 percent on year to 404,534 cases.           By the type of crime committed, property-related crimes such as fraud and burglary rose 11.3 percent to 155,718 cases.           This is a rapid increase considering that violent crimes in the first quarter only grew half a percent year-on-year, while traffic-related crimes only rose 1.2 percent.           “Crimes related to personal property have risen sharply as people struggle from Covid-19,” said Oh Yoon-sung, a criminology professor at Soonchunhyang University.           On Aug. 19, the owner of a comic book cafe in Gwangju, South Jeolla, called the police after realizing that he had been given a fake 50,000 won note.           The counterfeit note was reported to have been made on a normal household printer.           Two days later, counterfeit 10,000 won notes were found at a nearby traditional market.           “As the economy became unstable with the spread of Covid-19, we have started to see numerous counterfeits,” said Lee Ho-jung, head of Hana Bank’s counterfeit center.           Lee warned traditional market store owners to look out for counterfeit notes.           New types of crime have also emerged, including selling fake KF94 masks.           Crimes committed by elderly people have risen as well.           According to the Korea Institute of Criminology, the number of elderly people convicted of crimes in the first quarter of this year increased 9.9 percent year-on-year to 33,245.           Among elderly people, 9,069 were repeat offenders. That’s one in three.           According to Statistics Korea, the unemployment rate of people aged between 55 and 79 in May was 3.8 percent, the highest since related data started to be compiled in 2005.           “The increase in repeated offenses by elderly people, who only land simple jobs that are on-and-off, is highly related to the economic stagnation,” said Park Hyung-min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Criminology.           A police officer that requested anonymity said one unique thing about the crimes committed during the Covid-19 pandemic is that they are committed against poor people, rather than rich people.             BY MOON HEE-CHUL, PARK HYUN-JOO   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   ",                  As the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic continues the number of crimes reported involving theft of food and household items or attempts to use counterfeit money have shot up          A 40yearold was caught trying to illegally enter a restaurant in Cheonan South Chungcheong after robbing 11 stores Despite the crime spree the things the man stole were only worth between 10000 won 850 and 70000 won          A 50yearold was recently caught by the police after climbing up a utility pole to cut the wires and sell them to a junk yard          The court in early August sentenced him to two and a half years in prison          The judge while noting that the recent crime was committed out of desperation said the heavy sentence was handed down because the man had prior convictions and committed the crime when he should have been reflecting on the crimes he had committed in the past          Also in August a 70yearold man and a 60yearold woman were caught by police trying to steal napa cabbages from a farm in Pyeongchang Gangwon          The surge in petty crimes is clear in the quarterly crime report released by the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office          The report showed that in the first quarter of this year overall crime rose 5 percent on year to 404534 cases          By the type of crime committed propertyrelated crimes such as fraud and burglary rose 113 percent to 155718 cases          This is a rapid increase considering that violent crimes in the first quarter only grew half a percent yearonyear while trafficrelated crimes only rose 12 percent          “Crimes related to personal property have risen sharply as people struggle from Covid19” said Oh Yoonsung a criminology professor at Soonchunhyang University          On Aug 19 the owner of a comic book cafe in Gwangju South Jeolla called the police after realizing that he had been given a fake 50000 won note          The counterfeit note was reported to have been made on a normal household printer          Two days later counterfeit 10000 won notes were found at a nearby traditional market          “As the economy became unstable with the spread of Covid19 we have started to see numerous counterfeits” said Lee Hojung head of Hana Bank’s counterfeit center          Lee warned traditional market store owners to look out for counterfeit notes          New types of crime have also emerged including selling fake KF94 masks          Crimes committed by elderly people have risen as well          According to the Korea Institute of Criminology the number of elderly people convicted of crimes in the first quarter of this year increased 99 percent yearonyear to 33245          Among elderly people 9069 were repeat offenders That’s one in three          According to Statistics Korea the unemployment rate of people aged between 55 and 79 in May was 38 percent the highest since related data started to be compiled in 2005          “The increase in repeated offenses by elderly people who only land simple jobs that are onandoff is highly related to the economic stagnation” said Park Hyungmin a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Criminology          A police officer that requested anonymity said one unique thing about the crimes committed during the Covid19 pandemic is that they are committed against poor people rather than rich people           BY MOON HEECHUL PARK HYUNJOO leehojeongjoongangcokr   
30,Korea logs current account surplus for 4th month in August,"

                  Korea posted a current account surplus for a fourth straight month in August as exports declined at a slower pace than imports while major economies began to reopen, the central bank said Thursday.           The current account surplus reached $6.57 billion in August, down from $7.45 billion the previous month, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK). The current account is the broadest measure of cross-border trade.          The current account has been in the black since the country logged a deficit of $3.33 billion in April, the largest in almost a decade, on faltering exports amid the new coronavirus outbreak.          The BOK said the country is presumed to have posted a large current account surplus in September, given the trend of exports and imports.          ""In September, the current account surplus was estimated at a considerable size,"" Lee Seong-ho, director of the BOK's monetary and financial statistics division, said in a press briefing.          ""There will be no problem for the country to achieve a full-year target of surplus,"" he added.          In late August, the BOK lowered its 2020 outlook for the current account surplus to $54 billion from its earlier estimate of $57 billion, citing sluggish global trade amid the virus outbreak. The 2021 surplus is likely to reach $55 billion.          The goods balance posted a surplus of $7.01 billion in August, larger than the previous month's surplus of $6.97 billion.          The surplus in the goods balance widened to a nine-month high in August as exports fell at a slower pace than imports, the BOK said.          Exports, which account for half of the Korean economy, fell 10.3 percent on year to $40.7 billion in August, while imports declined by a wider margin of 17.3 percent to $33.7 billion on low oil prices.          The country's overseas shipments were battered by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic this year. But the pace of the slump has eased since June as major economies slowly began resuming business activities following the lockdowns.          Exports rebounded for the first time in seven months in September, aided by increased shipments of chips and cars, according to data from the Trade Ministry.          The service account, which includes outlays by Koreans on overseas trips, logged a deficit of $800 million in August after logging a shortfall of $1.11 billion in July.          The primary income account, which tracks wages of foreign workers and dividend payments overseas, logged a surplus of $630 million in August, smaller than a surplus of $1.95 billion in July.          The dividend income account swung to a deficit of $900 million in August, as overseas units of local companies hit by the pandemic failed to transfer money to their homeland.          The capital and financial account, which covers cross-border investments, posted a net inflow of $4.84 billion in August, compared with a net inflow of $9.59 billion the previous month.           Yonhap          ",                  Korea posted a current account surplus for a fourth straight month in August as exports declined at a slower pace than imports while major economies began to reopen the central bank said Thursday          The current account surplus reached 657 billion in August down from 745 billion the previous month according to the Bank of Korea BOK The current account is the broadest measure of crossborder trade         The current account has been in the black since the country logged a deficit of 333 billion in April the largest in almost a decade on faltering exports amid the new coronavirus outbreak         The BOK said the country is presumed to have posted a large current account surplus in September given the trend of exports and imports         In September the current account surplus was estimated at a considerable size Lee Seongho director of the BOKs monetary and financial statistics division said in a press briefing         There will be no problem for the country to achieve a fullyear target of surplus he added         In late August the BOK lowered its 2020 outlook for the current account surplus to 54 billion from its earlier estimate of 57 billion citing sluggish global trade amid the virus outbreak The 2021 surplus is likely to reach 55 billion         The goods balance posted a surplus of 701 billion in August larger than the previous months surplus of 697 billion         The surplus in the goods balance widened to a ninemonth high in August as exports fell at a slower pace than imports the BOK said         Exports which account for half of the Korean economy fell 103 percent on year to 407 billion in August while imports declined by a wider margin of 173 percent to 337 billion on low oil prices         The countrys overseas shipments were battered by the fallout of the Covid19 pandemic this year But the pace of the slump has eased since June as major economies slowly began resuming business activities following the lockdowns         Exports rebounded for the first time in seven months in September aided by increased shipments of chips and cars according to data from the Trade Ministry         The service account which includes outlays by Koreans on overseas trips logged a deficit of 800 million in August after logging a shortfall of 111 billion in July         The primary income account which tracks wages of foreign workers and dividend payments overseas logged a surplus of 630 million in August smaller than a surplus of 195 billion in July         The dividend income account swung to a deficit of 900 million in August as overseas units of local companies hit by the pandemic failed to transfer money to their homeland         The capital and financial account which covers crossborder investments posted a net inflow of 484 billion in August compared with a net inflow of 959 billion the previous month          Yonhap

32,Heads of university hospitals ask public to forgive students,"

     The presidents of some of Korea’s largest university hospitals bow as they apologize to the public Thursday at the Central Government Complex in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, for their students’ strike last summer. [YONHAP]         The presidents of some of Korea’s largest university hospitals jointly relayed a public apology Thursday on behalf of their students’ strike last summer, while imploring the government to offer another chance for college seniors to take the national medical licensing exam.           The statement, which was read in front of news cameras Thursday morning at the Central Government Complex in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, came as government authorities continue to reject pleas from medical students to receive additional applications for the annual medical licensing exam.           The test is usually taken by students who are in their last year of undergraduate medical training, which spans six years, or in their last year of graduate medical school, which lasts four years in total.           Nearly 85 percent of those who were supposed to apply for the exam last month didn’t, in a show of solidarity as they took part in a nationwide strike of doctors and trainees to protest the government’s medical reforms.             The reform package included a 4,000-student increase in medical school admissions over the next decade, the establishing of a public medical school, extending national health insurance coverage to include traditional Korean medicine and expanding remote medical services.           Following weeks of wrangling, the Korean Medical Association (KMA), which represents nationwide medical clinics, reached an agreement with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to suspend the medical reforms until the coronavirus crisis subsidies — days before the date by which medical students had to sign up for the medical licensing exam. That deadline had already been postponed twice as students were on a strike.           But medical students rejected the truce, saying their views were not sufficiently reflected. They didn’t sign up for the test, and the exam eventually started without them on Sept. 8.             Out of 3,172 students who were supposed to sign up, only 446 students, or 14 percent, did. The exam runs through Nov. 20.           But as doctors began to return to work, medical students lost momentum, and on Sept. 24, they announced in a joint statement that they were willing to take the test.           The government, however, refused to offer another chance to the students, saying they would have to earn “public sympathy” first.           The presidents of Korea University Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Yonsei University Health System and Inha University Hospital gathered Thursday in front of local journalists to win that precondition, apologizing to the nation for causing pain as it was going through a pandemic.           Kim Young-hoon, CEO and president of Korea University Medicine, who read the statement aloud, said he and his colleagues were “seriously worried” about the “medical vacuum” that would be caused if the nearly 2,700 students miss their chance to earn their medical licenses.             Kim urged the public to chastise senior doctors like him, not the students, for going on a strike during the pandemic, and give one more chance to the doctor hopefuls to end their six years of medical training on a positive note by taking and passing the exam.             The doctors then held a meeting with Jeon Hyeon-heui, chairperson of the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC), to ask for the organization’s support, but Jeon only repeated the government’s stance that public agreement had to be reached first.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN, LEE TAE-YUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   ",     The presidents of some of Korea’s largest

33,Seoul government tells Korean Air it now owns an expensive park,"

     An aerial view of Korean Air’s land in Songhyeong-dong, central Seoul. [YONHAP]               The Seoul Metropolitan Government has designated a large plot of land owned by Korean Air in the center of Seoul as a public park.           On Wednesday, the city government announced it would designate the Songhyeon-dong, central Seoul, site as a public park, changing it from the current “special-purpose complex.”           The redesignation will not come into effect until the Anti‑Corruption and Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) comes up with an arbitration plan between the city government and Korean Air, which opposes the designation. The procedure was initiated upon Korean Air’s request in August after Seoul City first proposed turning the land into a park for public use.           Covering nine acres, the piece of land in Songhyeon-dong is located right next to Gyeongbok Palace. The company purchased it from Samsung Life Insurance in 2008 and had planned to develop a cultural complex.           After years of failing to proceed with the project due to construction regulations in one of Seoul’s most preserved neighborhoods, the company announced that it would sell the plot of land along with other non-core property assets in February this year. It was part of a grand plan to secure funds amid a management crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.           Now that the site faces a future as a public park, it’s unlikely that Korea Air will be able to sell it for the high price it was looking for.           Instead of acquiring the land directly from Korean Air, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced Wednesday that it would pull the state-owned Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH) into the deal. LH would purchase the land from Korean Air first and Seoul would then trade another piece of land with LH for the former Korean Air plot.           Seoul had initially planned to pay Korean Air in increments until 2022, but the carrier rejected the proposal. The company had already received emergency funding of 1.2 trillion won ($1 billion) from its creditors in April and was in need of immediate funds.           “We concluded that pushing through procedures for the purchase of Songhyeon-dong land would accelerate payment — that would also benefit Korean Air going through financial difficulties,” said Kim Hak-jin, Seoul Metropolitan Government’s deputy mayor in a Wednesday press briefing.           LH, on the other hand, made it clear that its participation is not yet decided.           “We did receive a request from Seoul city last month to cooperate in purchasing the land for a public cause. But at the moment, the matter is still under examination. There is no agreement made with Seoul city,” LH said in a Wednesday statement.           Compared to its previous statements, Korean Air was relatively quiet after the Wednesday announcement, simply saying it is “waiting for the ACRC’s decision and will continue actively partaking in discussions with Seoul city and relevant organizations.”           It is not clear how much Korean Air will receive in return. Seoul had formerly said the land may be worth around 467 billion won —  much lower than the reported market estimate of over 500 billion won. However, Kim told reporters Wednesday that it would require an official property appraisal and further discussions to finalize the specific amount.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   ",     An aerial view of Korean Air’s land in Songhyeongdong central Seoul YONHAP              The Seoul Metropolitan Government has designated a large plot of land owned by Korean Air in the center of Seoul as a public park          On Wednesday the city government announced it would designate the Songhyeondong central Seoul site as a public park changing it from the current “specialpurpose complex”          The redesignation will not come into effect until theAnti‑Corruption and Civil Rights Commission ACRC comes up with an arbitration plan between the city government and Korean Air which opposes the designation The procedure was initiated upon Korean Air’s request in August after Seoul City first proposed turning the land into a park for public use          Covering nine acres the piece of land in Songhyeondong is located right next to Gyeongbok Palace The company purchased it from Samsung Life Insurance in 2008 and had planned to develop a cultural complex          After years of failing to proceed with the project due to construction regulations in one of Seoul’s most preserved neighborhoods the company announced that it would sell the plot of land along with other noncore property assets in February this year It was part of a grand plan to secure funds amid a management crisis caused by the Covid19 pandemic          Now that the site faces a future as a public park it’s unlikely that Korea Air will be able to sell it for the high price it was looking for          Instead of acquiring the land directly from Korean Air the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced Wednesday that it would pull the stateowned Korea Land and Housing Corporation LH into the deal LH would purchase the land from Korean Air first and Seoul would then trade another piece of land with LH for the former Korean Air plot          Seoul had initially planned to pay Korean Air in increments until 2022 but the carrier rejected the proposal The company had already received emergency funding of 12 trillion won 1 billion from its creditors in April and was in need of immediate funds          “We concluded that pushing through procedures for the purchase of Songhyeondong land would accelerate payment — that would also benefit Korean Air going through financial difficulties” said Kim Hakjin Seoul Metropolitan Government’s deputy mayor in a Wednesday press briefing          LH on the other hand made it clear that its participation is not yet decided          “We did receive a request from Seoul city last month to cooperate in purchasing the land for a public cause But at the moment the matter is still under examination There is no agreement made with Seoul city” LH said in a Wednesday statement          Compared to its previous statements Korean Air was relatively quiet after the Wednesday announcement simply saying it is “waiting for the ACRC’s decision and will continue actively partaking in discussions with Seoul city and relevant organizations”          It is not clear how much Korean Air will receive in return Seoul had formerly said the land may be worth around 467 billion won — much lower than the reported market estimate of over 500 billion won However Kim told reporters Wednesday that it would require an official property appraisal and further discussions to finalize the specific amount          BY SONG KYOUNGSONsongkyoungsonjoongangcokr   
34,Korean makes final round for selection of WTO head,"

     Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee at Incheon International Airport on Sept. 27 as she leaves for Europe in campaigning for the World Trade Organization's director-general position. Yoo is now one of the two contenders that has made it to the second round. [YONHAP]                Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee is now one of the two final contenders for the top position at the World Trade Organization (WTO).           According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Thursday, Yoo and Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala made it to the final round after deliberations in Geneva on Thursday.           The race for the WTO director-general position started with eight candidates. The first round in September eliminated three candidates — Jesús Seade Kuri of Meixco, Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh of Eygpt and Tudor Ulianovschi of Moldova. The second round eliminated three including Amina Mohamed of Kenya, Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri of Saudi Arabia and Liam Fox of Britain.           A final decision by the 164 member countries is expected on Nov. 7.           No matter who is picked, the World Trade Organization will have its first woman director since its founding in 1995.           If Yoo is picked, she will be the first Korean to head the international trade institution.           Korean candidates have competed for the WTO’s top position three times in the past. This is the first time a Korean candidate made the final round.           According to the Korean government, Yoo received support from members across the board from Europe, South America, Asia-Pacific and Central Asia, many of them praising Korea’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.           Yoo, a civil servant since 1991, specializes in trade. She was involved in the bilateral FTA between Korea and the United States.           Yoo has been strongly supported by President Moon Jae-in.           According to the Blue House, Moon told the government to put all possible efforts into Yoo succeeding.           “The biggest hurdle is left,” Moon said on Thursday, according to Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok.           “The government has to give all that it has [to help Yoo win] for the development of multilateral trade and the expansion of the free trade order,” Moon said.           It has been reported that Moon has personally made calls to top leaders of other countries on behalf of Yoo's candidacy, including a request for support from Russian President Vladimir Putin last month during a phone call celebrating the 30th anniversary of trade relationship between the two countries.           Moon also asked for Germany’s support during a phone call to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Oct. 1.           Korea’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has reportedly asked for support from Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru, Jordon and other countries.           Okonjo-Iweala is a strong contender, having served as Nigeria’s finance minister twice and its foreign affairs minister. She has strong international connections after working at the World Bank for 25 years and rising to its No. 2 position.           WTO chief Roberto Azevedo unexpectedly resigned in May with a year remaining in his term.           The WTO director-general serves a four-year term that can be extended once.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   ",     Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myunghee at Incheon International Airport on Sept 27 as she leaves for Europe in campaigning for the World Trade Organizations directorgeneral position Yoo is now one of the two contenders that has made it to the second round YONHAP               Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myunghee is now one of the two final contenders for the top position at the World Trade Organization WTO          According to the Ministry of Trade Industry and Energy on Thursday Yoo and Nigeria’s Ngozi OkonjoIweala made it to the final round after deliberations in Geneva on Thursday          The race for the WTO directorgeneral position started with eight candidates The first round in September eliminated three candidates — Jesús Seade Kuri of Meixco AbdelHamid Mamdouh of Eygpt and Tudor Ulianovschi of Moldova The second round eliminated three including Amina Mohamed of Kenya Mohammad AlTuwaijri of Saudi Arabia and Liam Fox of Britain          A final decision by the 164 member countries is expected on Nov 7          No matter who is picked the World Trade Organization will have its first woman director since its founding in 1995          If Yoo is picked she will be the first Korean to head the international trade institution          Korean candidates have competed for the WTO’s top position three times in the past This is the first time a Korean candidate made the final round          According to the Korean government Yoo received support from members across the board from Europe South America AsiaPacific and Central Asia many of them praising Korea’s handling of the Covid19 pandemic          Yoo a civil servant since 1991 specializes in trade She was involved in the bilateral FTA between Korea and the United States          Yoo has been strongly supported by President Moon Jaein          According to the Blue House Moon told the government to put all possible efforts into Yoo succeeding          “The biggest hurdle is left” Moon said on Thursday according to Blue House spokesman Kang Minseok          “The government has to give all that it has to help Yoo win for the development of multilateral trade and the expansion of the free trade order” Moon said          It has been reported that Moon has personally made calls to top leaders of other countries on behalf of Yoos candidacy including a request for support from Russian President Vladimir Putin last month during a phone call celebrating the 30th anniversary of trade relationship between the two countries          Moon also asked for Germany’s support during a phone call to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Oct 1          Korea’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyungwha has reportedly asked for support from Ecuador Indonesia Peru Jordon and other countries          OkonjoIweala is a strong contender having served as Nigeria’s finance minister twice and its foreign affairs minister She has strong international connections after working at the World Bank for 25 years and rising to its No 2 position          WTO chief Roberto Azevedo unexpectedly resigned in May with a year remaining in his term          The WTO directorgeneral serves a fouryear term that can be extended once          BY LEE HOJEONG leehojeongjoongangcokr

37,Japan calls for removal of 'comfort woman' statue in Berlin,"

     People look at a ""comfort woman"" statue, symbolizing Korean victims of wartime sexual slavery by the imperial Japanese army during World War II, erected in Berlin, Germany, on Sept. 27. [YONHAP]                Korea voiced criticism Thursday over Japan's call for the removal of a statue erected in Germany of a girl symbolizing Korean victims of wartime sexual slavery, calling it an act that goes against the spirit of its own apology.           Last week, Tokyo expressed regret over the recent installation of the statue on a public site near the Japanese Embassy in Berlin. The statue was erected by Korea Verband, a Berlin-based civic group with South Korean ties.           The issue drew attention as Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi requested it be removed when he held bilateral talks with his German counterpart, Heiko Maas, in Berlin last week.           ""The installation of the statue is a voluntary move by the private sector. It is not desirable for the government to get diplomatically involved,"" ministry spokesperson Kim In-chul said in a press briefing when asked about the statue.           ""The government stepping in to force its removal does not help resolve the problem at all. It also goes against the spirit of the sense of responsibility and self-reflection and apology that Japan has revealed itself.""           The government will keep a close eye on the matter and will act accordingly, Kim added.           The installation of the statue comes as the bilateral relations between Seoul and Tokyo remain badly frayed over the issue of compensating Korean forced labor victims and Tokyo's export restrictions on Seoul.           The sexual slavery victims, euphemistically called ""comfort women,"" are one of the many thorny issues stemming from the 1910-45 period when Korea was a Japanese colony.           Historians say that around 200,000 Asian women, mostly Koreans, were forcibly sent to frontline brothels to provide sex services for Japanese soldiers during World War II. In the landmark 1993 Kono Statement of apology, Japan acknowledged for the first time that women were forcibly recruited into sexual slavery.           It is the third comfort women statue installed in Germany and the first to stand in a public place with approval from the Berlin authorities.

38,"Worries about spike on Hangul Day, especially on Jeju","

     Signs on Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, Thursday, warn that protests are not allowed in downtown Seoul. Police and the Seoul Metropolitan Government have vowed to block right-wing civic groups planning to demonstrate on Friday, Hangul Day. [NEWS1]         Korea added 69 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday, dipping back below 100 as the nation goes into a three-day holiday.           The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) announced the drop Thursday morning, saying 60 were domestic infections and nine were imported. There were 114 new cases Tuesday, the first time in a week that Korea had seen a triple-digit daily Covid-19 number.           Among Wednesday’s domestic infections, 22 were in Gyeonggi, 19 in Seoul, seven in Daejeon, five each in Busan and Incheon and one each in North Gyeongsang and South Gyeongsang.           A cluster at a hospital in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi, added nine cases to reach a total of 35, health officials said. Of that figure, 16 were hospitalized patients, while 16 others have been identified as caretakers and three as the hospital’s nurses. Thirty-two people were either patients hospitalized on the fifth floor of the facility or their caretakers.                            No serious clusters have emerged this week after last week’s five-day Chuseok holidays, but health authorities say they fear the virus may be quietly spreading, which is why members of the public are strongly encouraged to keep vigilant and practice social distancing.           With Hangul Day coming this Friday, a national holiday when Korea celebrates the invention of the Korean alphabet, health authorities Thursday once again urged the public to stay indoors and keep away from crowds.           Some 95,000 people, however, are expected to flout those guidelines this week as they travel to the southern resort island of Jeju. The Jeju Tourism Organization announced that from Thursday to Sunday, that number of people are expected to land on the island. That is 30 percent fewer than the same period last year, yet still a worrying number when considering the ongoing pandemic.           From Sept. 29 to Oct. 4, when the nation celebrated Chuseok, nearly 195,000 people traveled to Jeju.           There’s also the possibility that anti-Moon Jae-in civic groups may try to protest in Gwanghwamun Square, central Seoul, on Friday, which the police and Seoul Metropolitan Government have vowed to block.           Yoon Tae-ho, an official at the Central Disaster Management Headquarters, implored the public Thursday to abide by the government’s preventive measures for the virus, reminding them that the entire nation is subject to so-called Special Prevention Period measures, which are similar to Level 2 of the three-tier social distancing system.           The Special Prevention Period, which began on Sept. 28, is expected to expire Sunday midnight, after which a new set of measures will go into effect from Monday.           What those new set of measures will be is not yet known. Yoon said an announcement will be made Sunday after health officials spend more time monitoring Chuseok’s impact.           Among Wednesday’s imported cases, three each were from Indonesia and the United States, and one each was from the Philippines, Myanmar and Poland.           Two people died Wednesday, raising total deaths from the coronavirus to 427, while 129 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 22,463. As of Wednesday at midnight, Korea had counted 24,422 Covid-19 patients in all.           On a separate note, an Incheon court Thursday sentenced a 24-year-old former hagwon (private cram school) instructor to six months in prison for lying to epidemiologists about his occupation and where he went before he tested positive for the coronavirus in May.           At the time, the instructor told contact-tracers he was unemployed, disguising the fact that he teaches young students. That delayed efforts by government officials to contact his students and warn them to self-isolate, eventually leading to a chain of infections that transmitted the virus to over 80 people across the country, over 40 of whom were grade-school students in Incheon.           The Incheon instructor himself was apparently infected while partying in Itaewon, central Seoul, on the night of May 2 and in the early hours of the next day, the same time that the coronavirus was silently spreading in clubs that mostly catered to gay people.           While prosecutors had asked the court for a two-year prison term, the Incheon District Court said Thursday that it took into account the fact that he appeared to have lied because he was “afraid that his sexual identity might be revealed.”           BY

39,North may unveil new ICBM: Unification Ministry,"

     South Korean Unification Minister Lee In-young answers lawmakers' questions at a parliamentary audit hearing on Thursday. [YONHAP]               North Korea appears to be preparing a measured show of force at an upcoming military parade marking the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party, South Korea’s top inter-Korean official said Thursday.             During a parliamentary audit hearing at the National Assembly, Minister of Unification Lee In-young presented a somewhat different forecast from Seoul’s military officials — as well as his own ministry — of what lay in store during Pyongyang’s big event Saturday, for which the regime has been preparing for months.           “In the past, ahead of a U.S. presidential election, and to show off its nuclear or missile capacities, [the North] would actually fire or test [missiles],” Lee said. “But this time, we are getting indications that [Pyongyang] will conduct something on the level of lower intensity acts or shows of force.”           Lee did not elaborate on what he meant by “lower intensity,” but according to his own ministry’s report to the National Assembly, Pyongyang was likely to unveil a new “strategic weapon” it has warned about for months, which could range from a new form of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to a submarine-launched ballistic missile.              A similar prediction was made a day earlier by Seoul’s Minister of National Defense Suh Wook, who expressed agreement with a lawmaker’s assertion that the North was more likely to display a new missile than conduct an active provocation in the form of a weapons test.             Pyongyang has often used its grandiose military parades in Kim Il Sung Square to show off the latest additions to its ever-expanding missile arsenal, most notably with the unveiling of its Hwasong-15 ICBM in February 2018.           Those displays, according to the Unification Ministry, may be attempts at “underscoring [the regime’s global] sense of existence amid showing a lackluster economic performance” this year.           This year’s event is expected to be particularly momentous for the North, given that it marks the party's 75th anniversary and comes as leader Kim Jong-un enters his 10th year in power. The occasion may be a way for the regime to relay a long-awaited message abroad after months of focusing on domestic troubles like typhoon relief and antipandemic activities.             “North Korea after the party foundation ceremony will search for a strategic response plan for inter-Korean and North Korea-U.S. relations,” the ministry report added.             “The outcome of the U.S. election will determine the tone of U.S. policy toward the North, such as whether negotiations resume or a period of readjustments continues.”           The regime itself made clear in earlier statements it was closely watching U.S. President Donald Trump’s re-election contest against Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, and that it would adjust its attitude according to the result.             For its part, South Korea will continue efforts to restore communication lines with the North severed by Pyongyang’s escalations over the summer that culminated in its unilateral demolition in June of the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong.           The ministry also addressed last month’s killing of a South Korean fisheries official by the North in its waters, calling it an “inhumane act.” Defense Minister Suh on Wednesday also criticized the North’s response as inexcusable, but said the South’s military initially saw little indication the official would have ended up in North Korean waters when he was first reported missing.             The incident, which continues to rile debate in Seoul about the government’s response, has apparently dampened the Unification Ministry’s willingness to pursue exchanges with Pyongyang. On its agenda for the time being, the ministry reported it would take a “cautious” approach to cooperation with the North, though it would continue efforts to realize Lee’s plan of “small-scale” barter trades across the border.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]         ",     South Korean Unification Minister Lee Inyoung answers lawmakers questions at a parliamentary audit hearing on Thursday YONHAP              North Korea appears to be preparing a measured show of force at an upcoming military parade marking the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party South Korea’s top interKorean official said Thursday          During a parliamentary audit hearing at the National Assembly Minister of Unification Lee Inyoung presented a somewhat different forecast from Seoul’s military officials— as well as his own ministry— of what lay in store during Pyongyang’s big event Saturday for which the regime has been preparing for months          “In the past ahead of a US presidential election and to show off its nuclear or missile capacities the North would actually fire or test missiles” Lee said “But this time we are getting indicationsthat Pyongyang will conduct something on the level of lower intensity acts or shows of force”          Lee did not elaborate on what he meant by “lower intensity” but according to his own ministry’s report to the National Assembly Pyongyang was likely to unveil a new “strategic weapon” it has warned about for months which could range from a new form of an intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM to a submarinelaunched ballistic missile           A similar prediction was made a day earlier by Seoul’s Minister of National Defense Suh Wook who expressed agreement with a lawmaker’s assertion that the North was more likely to display a new missile than conduct an active provocation in the form of a weapons test           Pyongyang has often used its grandiose military parades in Kim Il Sung Square to show off the latest additions to its everexpanding missile arsenal most notably with the unveiling of its Hwasong15 ICBM in February 2018          Those displays according to the Unification Ministry may be attempts at “underscoring the regime’s global sense of existence amid showing a lackluster economic performance” this year          This year’s event is expected to be particularly momentous for the North given that it marks the partys 75th anniversary and comes as leader Kim Jongun enters his 10th year in power The occasion may be a way for the regime to relay a longawaited message abroad after months of focusing on domestic troubles like typhoon relief and antipandemic activities           “North Korea after the party foundation ceremony will search for a strategic response plan for interKorean and North KoreaUS relations” the ministry report added           “The outcome of the US election will determine the tone of US policy toward the North such as whether negotiations resume or a period of readjustments continues”          The regime itself made clear in earlier statements it was closely watching US President Donald Trump’s reelection contest against Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden and that it would adjust its attitude according to the result           For its part South Korea will continue efforts to restore communication lines with the North severed by Pyongyang’s escalations over the summer that culminated in its unilateral demolition in June of the interKorean liaison office in Kaesong          The ministry also addressed last month’s killing of a South Korean fisheries official by the North in its waters calling it an “inhumane act” Defense Minister Suh on Wednesday also criticized the North’s response as inexcusable but said the South’s military initially saw little indication the official would have ended up in North Korean waters when he was first reported missing           The incident which continues to rile debate in Seoul about the government’s response has apparently dampened the Unification Ministry’s willingness to pursue exchanges with Pyongyang On its agenda for the time being the ministry reported it would take a “cautious” approach to cooperation with the North though it would continue efforts to realize Lee’s plan of “smallscale” barter trades across the border           BY SHIM KYUSEOK shimkyuseokjoongangcokr
