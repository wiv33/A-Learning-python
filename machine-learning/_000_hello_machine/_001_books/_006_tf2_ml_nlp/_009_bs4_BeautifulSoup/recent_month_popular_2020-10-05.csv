The founder of the Kenzo fashion house, Kenzo Takada, has died from Covid-19, his spokesperson announced in Paris on Sunday. [AFP/YONHAP]               PARIS — Kenzo Takada, the iconic French-Japanese fashion designer famed for his jungle-infused designs and free-spirited aesthetic that channeled global travel, has died. He was 81.           The family said in a statement to French media Sunday that Takada died from complications from Covid-19 in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. A public relations officer for Kenzo's brand confirmed that Takada died, but didn't give a cause of death.           ""It is with immense sadness that KENZO has learned of the passing of our founder,"" the fashion house said in a statement. ""For half a century, Mr. Takada has been an emblematic personality in the fashion industry — always infusing creativity and color into the world.""           Takada's death came at the tail end of Paris Fashion Week, whose nine-day calendar is undertaking an unusual fashion season for spring-summer 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was only days ago that the Kenzo fashion house unveiled its bee-themed collection here.           Though Takada had been retired from his house since 1999 to pursue a career in art, Kenzo remains one of the most respected fixtures of high Paris fashion. Since 1993, the Kenzo brand has been owned by the French luxury goods company LVMH.            ""His amazing energy, kindness, talent and smile were contagious,"" said Kenzo artistic director Felipe Oliveira Baptista, who unveiled the bee-themed collection to fashion editors Wednesday. ""His kindred spirit will live forever.""           Kenzo's styles used bold colors, clashing prints and were inspired by travels all over the world.           ""Kenzo Takada has, from the 1970s, infused into fashion a tone of poetic lightness and sweet freedom which inspired many designers after him,"" said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH.           Takada was born on Feb. 27, 1939, in Himeji, in the Hyogo Prefecture in Japan to hoteliers, but after reading his sisters' fashion magazines his love of fashion began.           Studying at the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo, Kenzo Takada had a brief stint working in Japan, before relocating to Paris in 1965, to work as a freelance designer.           In Paris, he took over a boutique in 1970 and crystallized his future ready-to-wear aesthetic inspired in its decoration by the jungle scenes of painter Henri Rousseau, which he merged with Asian styles. It became influential.            But they were lowly beginnings: Takada's first collection at the store was made entirely out of cotton because he had little money. But the clothes spoke for themselves and a model of his was put on the cover of Elle magazine. A short time after, pioneering shoulder forms, large armholes, dungarees, smock tent dresses, innovative shoulder shapes, and his store was featured in U.S. Vogue. Kenzo showed collections in New York and Tokyo in 1971.           Yves Saint Laurent was an important inspiration in his work, Takada has said. Takada shared Saint Laurent's penchant for theatrics. in 1978 and 1979, he showed in a circus tent, and it featured himself riding an elephant, and performers rode horses wearing see-through uniforms.           Takada's love of travel and use of ethnic influences were strong features in his three decades atop his house.           His contribution to style was significant. He championed a youthful aesthetic and unstructured form, and did away with zippers to liberate silhouettes. His signatures were of wider sleeves and armholes, that harked to historic styles in his home continent of Asia.           AP   "
1,Ruling party floats alternative military service for BTS members,"

     In this file photo, members of K-pop group BTS pose with President Moon Jae-in during the Youth Day ceremony at the Blue House on Sept. 19, 2020.  [YONHAP]                The ruling party on Monday floated the possibility of offering the members of K-pop group BTS an alternative to their required military service as a thank-you for the boy band's massive economic and cultural impact.             “We are expecting to see 60 trillion won [$51.7 billion] worth of economic gains over a decade — 6 trillion won alone for this year — from the K-pop stars of BTS,” Rep. Noh Woong-rae, a member of the Supreme Council of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), said during the Monday leadership meeting.             “When BTS topped the Billboard Hot 100, we saw about 1.7 trillion won in economic effects,” he continued. “Their role in boosting Korea’s prestige to the world is impossible to measure. We must start a serious discussion on offering special arrangements for military conscription to its members.”             “Military duty is sacred, but not everyone has to hold a rifle,” Noh said. “Engineers, classic artists [and athletes] have alternative programs, but pop culture artists are not covered.”               Noh proposed that BTS be drafted for state projects such as a campaign to promote the Dokdo islets — a disputed territory to which Japan lays competing claims — to the international community in exchange for serving their military duty traditionally.             Offering a special volunteer program to replace conscription for pop artists such as BTS members would require a revision to the Military Service Act.           As of now, the government offers alternative programs to classic artists, athletes, engineers, scientists and technology researchers to utilize their talents. They serve in various volunteer programs if they possess certain qualifications.             Athletes who won Olympic medals or gold medals in the Asian Games are granted exemptions from military service. Award-winning classical artists, such as pianists and directors, are also eligible for exemptions.             Last month, the DP proposed a bill to revise the Military Service Act to allow pop artists to delay their enlistments. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jeon Yong-gi, is currently pending before the National Assembly’s National Defense Committee.             “Allowing a chance to delay enlistment is completely different from giving an exemption or arranging a special program,” Jeon said at the time. “We must offer the young men whose careers peak in their 20s an option to delay their military service.”             Kim Seok-jin, also known by his stage name Jin, is the eldest member of BTS. Born in 1992, he must join the military by the end of 2021 under the current Military Service Act.             The conservative opposition People Power Party (PPP) said it agrees with the intention, but has stressed that the process must be fair.             When Jeon proposed the revision bill to the Military Service Act, Rep. Ha Tae-keung of the PPP posted a message on his Facebook and demanded an objective standard for selection.             “Can an idol singer delay his enlistment if he is chosen by the culture minister?” Ha wrote. “Is this a dictatorship? The ruling and opposition parties must form a consultative body to create a fair standard.”             Meanwhile, a series of public petitions have been filed to the Blue House’s bulletin board to seek special arrangements for BTS members. Some proposed an exemption, while many others asked for a delay or an alternate program to best utilize the K-pop stars’ talents.             None of them, however, collected enough signatures as of Monday to warrant a reply from the government. Petitions with more than 200,000 signatures receive an official response.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                       "
2,State asks for Chun to be jailed for 18 months,"

     Chun Doo Hwan, Korea's authoritarian leader of the 1980s, photographed in March 2019. Prosecutors recommended a one-and-half-year jail sentence for the ex-president. [YONHAP]               Prosecutors on Monday recommended a jail sentence of 18 months for Korea’s former strongman Chun Doo Hwan, two years after he was indicted for defaming a priest who penned a harrowing account of the bloody military crackdown on the 1980 Gwangju Uprising.             Monday was one of the final hearings in the high-profile trial involving the ex-president — who was jailed and pardoned in the 1990s on charges of conspiracy and insurrection — in what could be the last opportunity for survivors of the brutal suppression to get justice.             The unapologetic Chun, now 89, published a controversial three-volume memoir in 2017 that labeled the late activist Catholic priest Cho Chul-hyun a “shameless liar” and “Satan wearing a mask” for claiming soldiers commanded by Chun opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators from a helicopter.            Cho, who died of cancer in 2016, was an eyewitness and participant in the uprising from May 18 to 27, 1980. He recollected his memories of the crackdown in a parliamentary hearing in 1989, testifying that machine gunfire from a helicopter was one of the various ways in which soldiers sent by Chun attempted to suppress the movement.             The exact number of casualties of that nine-day movement remains disputed, though it is believed to number in the hundreds.             The massacre was forever seared into public memory in Korea, and played an instrumental role in galvanizing underground movements that eventually forced the junta to concede to democratic presidential elections in 1987.             For decades, however, Chun has challenged the narrative of that movement, denying he ordered the crackdown and downplaying its brutality.             His memoir, a wholesale apology for his authoritarian presidency, showed his beliefs had not changed in spite of ample evidence to the contrary.             Within days of its publication, the family of the late priest filed a criminal complaint accusing Chun of defaming the dead, which is a crime in Korea. Chun was indicted by Gwangju prosecutors in 2018.             In apparent defiance, Chun refused to attend most hearings of his trial, citing poor health, including a claim that he suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. His most recent show in court was in April, when a judge required him to undergo an arraignment.             Given the slow pace of the trial, it is unclear when the former president’s sentencing will take place, with legal analysts divided as to whether it will be possible within this year.             Whatever the case, Chun will be forced to attend that final hearing, which will decide whether to put him back in jail more than two decades after his pardon.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]    "
3,Gov't keeps pushing for higher debt-to-GDP ceiling,"

     Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki, second from left, explains the fiscal rule during a press briefing held at Sejong government complex on Monday. [YONHAP]               The government said it favored a new guideline restricting the national debt to 60 percent of Korea's GDP.           But it wouldn't be legally binding, won't come into effect until at least 2025 and is far above a debt limit that has been respected by Korean governments for years, which is 40 percent of GDP.           The Finance Ministry said Monday it is planning to adopt a new fiscal rule that will give it more freedom to execute aggressive fiscal policies.           “In the world, 92 countries have fiscal rules,” Finance Minster Hong Nam-ki said. “Among advanced economies, Korea and Turkey are the only ones that don’t.”             A debt-to-GDP ceiling prevents governments from spending too much and adding risk to an economy.           The Finance Ministry said the 60 percent limit will not be a legal requirement and therefore could be applied flexibly, meaning that in a crisis situation the government could exceed the ceiling.             The maximum limit will be relaxed in times of major crisis including war, natural disaster or a global economic crisis, the ministry said.            “We have put into consideration [in the new standard] the role of fiscal policy not being constrained in times of unusual circumstances such as an economic crisis,” Hong said.             The idea of creating a fiscal rule arose in May when the government was working on a third supplementary budget that raised Korea's debt ratio to above 40 percent of its GDP.            Since at least the Lee Myung-bak adminstration, the general consensus was that the debt limit should be 40 percent of GDP, which the Finance Ministry concurred with.             A ratio exceeding 40 percent was believed to put Korea's fiscal soundness at risk.           In an early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, President Moon Jae-in ordered the Finance Ministry to disregard the 40 percent barrier citing the emergency situation.             In late May, Moon argued that Korea’s debt-to-GDP ratio was far lower than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member country’s average of 110 percent.             The ruling Democratic Party, when preparing the third supplementary budget in May, argued that the government should not be held to the 40 percent ratio but should consider raising it to 60 percent.           With four supplementary budgets approved, the national debt-to-GDP ratio has been raised to nearly 43.9 percent.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
4,Shinsegae opens Starfield in Anseong,"

     Starfield Anseong               Shinsegae Property is opening a new Starfield shopping complex in Anseong, Gyeonggi, on Wednesday.           Jointly invested in by U.S.-based shopping mall developer Tubman, the fourth Starfield is the largest shopping complex in the southern part of Gyeonggi, according to Shinsegae Property.           The investment proportion between Shinsegae Property and Tubman is 51 percent to 49 percent.           Measuring 240,000 square meters (2.28 million square feet), the shopping complex has parking room for 5,000 vehicles. The five-storied building consists of two basement floors and three above-ground floors.           It is much larger than nearby shopping centers, including the Shinsegae Premium Outlet in Siheung, Gyeonggi, and Lotte Premium Outlet in Icheon, Gyeonggi.           The shopping complex will house numerous facilities and popular eateries, according to Shinsegae Property, including a 63-meter (207-feet) high observatory with views of a nearby forest and plaza.             Starfield Anseong is also designed to be pet-friendly. There is a park where customers can take their pets for a walk and eat together.           Shinsegae Property designed the complex to meet the needs of families with kids. A library, outdoor playground and waterpark are some of the facilities at Starfield Anseong.           The company said it intentionally opened the shopping complex after the Chuseok harvest holidays, which ended Sunday, to prevent large crowds over Covid-19 concerns. Preopening a big-box warehouse chain Traders last month was part of its effort to prevent crowds at the new Starfield.           “Following Starfield Hanam and Goyang, which support the east and west of the metropolitan area, Starfield Anseong, which will take care of the southern part of Gyeonggi, is finally opening amid the expectations of local residents,” said Shinsegae Property CEO Lim Young-rok.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]   Related ArticleCoronavirus takes toll on Shinsegae unitsShinsegae and K-water to build a massive theme park"
5,Shortage of fresh tomatoes bugs burger chains,"

     Burger King’s announcement saying that they will offer more lettuce, onions and pickles instead of tomatoes in their burgers. [SCREEN CAPTURE]                After this summer’s unusually extended rainy season and multiple typhoons, burger chains are struggling amid a nationwide shortage of fresh tomatoes.           Burger chain Lotteria has started to serve burgers without tomatoes, for which they've reduced the price by 300 won ($0.26). Another big burger chain, McDonald's, offers customers a free-drink coupon in exchange for tomato-less burgers.           Burger King, the first fast-food chain to announce difficulties procuring tomatoes, has been compensating with more lettuce, onions and pickles.           According to burger franchises, it’s the first time in history that they've served burgers without tomatoes. The prolonged heavy rainfall coincided with the blossoming of tomato plants, causing the crops to get less sunlight than usual. And powerful typhoons this summer knocked down plants in the main tomato producing regions of Chuncheon, Cheorwon and Hwacheon in Gangwon.            According to the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation, the wholesale price of 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of tomatoes was about 62,660 won as of Sept. 25, a 110 percent hike compared to a month earlier. Prices were up by 99.6 percent compared with a month earlier.          “A growing number of farmers have been halting tomato production, as lots of their farms were hit by typhoons,” a tomato farmer in Gangwon said. “The prices of tomatoes are expected to keep on rising even after the Chuseok holidays.”           It is likely to take a while until burger chains are able to again serve burgers with tomatoes.           The Korea Rural Economic Institute predicted that the volume of tomatoes being shipped out in October will be reduced by 15 percent compared to a year before. The price of tomatoes will likely stabilize as early as November.           Burger franchises are not the only businesses affected.             “We decided to stop selling tomato juice, as the tomato prices had increased dramatically,” a man who runs a cafe in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, said. “We will also temporarily stop selling any food items containing tomatoes, such as sandwiches.”           Retailers are scrambling to secure orders of tomatoes.           Retailer Emart managed to secure 60 tons of tomatoes from Jangsu and Wanju, both in North Jeolla, to cover anticipated demand during the Chuseok holidays.           “Tomato prices have been reaching all-time highs due to the long rainy season and typhoons,” Koo Jae-hyun, who is in charge of purchasing tomatoes at Emart, said. “We’ve been trying hard to lower the unit prices of tomatoes by buying large quantities, as well as to secure any alternatives.”           Meanwhile, sales of other fruits and vegetables have risen.            According to Emart, avocado sales between Sept. 1 and Sept. 27 soared 120 percent compared to the same period last year. During the same period, sales of lettuce rose 80 percent while sales of frozen blueberries increased 45 percent. Apple sales increased by 22 percent, while broccoli rose by 25 percent and cucumbers by 15 percent.           BY KWAK JAE-MIN   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

9,A cosmetic line fit for a princess ,"

     Based on the recent research results on a set of Princess Hwahyeop's cosmetics, the National Palace Museum of Korea, the Korea National University of Cultural Heritage and Cosmax plan to launch a K-beauty brand Princess Hwahyup by November. Left is a white porcelain octagonal flat jar with the seven treasures motifs found inside the princess's makeup box and right is the redesigned porcelain jar by the three institutions for the new K-beauty products. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]               Today's princesses make headlines for their fashion choices. From wedding gowns to makeup looks, people love to scrutinize the royals from head to toe. So when an intact makeup box belonging to Princess Hwahyeop (1733-52) of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) was unearthed in 2016 from an 18th-century tomb located in Namyangju, Gyeonggi, Koreans were thrilled at the chance of getting a glimpse into the beauty culture of Joseon’s royal court.           Born in 1733 as the seventh daughter of King Yeongjo (1694-1776), the 21st king of the Joseon Dynasty, historical records attest that Princess Hwahyeop was dearly beloved by her father, though there are disputes regarding this until today. She married Shin Gwang-su in 1743 when she was only 11 years old and was said to be beautiful, taking after her mother.            A variety of the princess's objects were accidentally discovered in her initial tomb, which was relocated in the 1970s. The items included a tombstone identifying Princess Hwahyeop as the person buried there, an epitaph written by King Yeongjo lamenting his daughter's death and the makeup box, which contained porcelain containers with cosmetic residue still inside, a mirror, a mirror case, and a water dropper among others, wrapped in cloth.               A collection of cosmetic cases and tools has been uncovered from an 18th-century tomb located in Namyangju, Gyeonggi, which belonged to Princess Hwahyeop (1733-52) who died at the age of 20 due to measles. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]       An epitaph written by King Yeongjo lamenting his daughter's death was also discovered inside the tomb. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]               Archeologists said that the box and its contents were able to remain intact for nearly 300 years because it was surrounded by thick tombstones when it was buried.           After years of research, the Cultural Heritage Administration recently announced the detailed materials which could have been used to produce the makeup used by the princess and added that it will create a modernized version of Princess Hwahyeop’s cosmetics using traditional materials.           “Researchers from the National Palace Museum of Korea, the National University of Cultural Heritage and Cosmax, a local cosmetics manufacturer, have been working together to create beauty products based on the result of the research,” said Kwon Hyuk-nam, an official from the National Palace Museum of Korea. Cosmax is one of the biggest suppliers to world-class cosmetics companies and the creator behind hit K-beauty items such as CC cream and cushion foundations.           “We’ll produce skin care and makeup products by using various natural ingredients to produce Princess Hwahyeop’s cosmetics while designing containers which are also inspired by the designs of the princess’s actual containers.”             The three organizations will be jointly launching a cosmetics brand called Princess Hwahyup and distributing it online from November.           “We hope to promote traditionally-inspired Korean skin care and makeup products across the globe and translate the features of royal beauty into the modern generation and amaze global consumers with great K-beauty products,” Kwon added.              Unearthed porcelain containers found inside Princess Hwahyeop's makeup box. Some of the porcelain is from China and Japan. They were found intact with cosmetic residue inside. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]       Samples of the new K-beauty brand Princess Hwahyup which is slated to be launched in November. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]               The three organizations signed an agreement late last month to work together until 2023 to develop and promote K-beauty products that are traditionally-based.           K-beauty has already taken the world by storm, becoming a big moneymaker for the beauty industry. Retail cosmetics stores across the world today are eager to secure shelves for Korean beauty products that range from skin care to makeup.             Analysts however, point to the growing interest in skin care across the globe that first brought K-beauty into the spotlight.            This is no surprise as Korean women, for the longest time, have been obsessed with having fair skin.            It was no exception for Princess Hwahyeop, who is said to have used a lot of her fortune on beauty products, sold by makeup saleswomen known as maebungu, who visited different houses carrying expensive makeup and skin care products from other regions.           Many of the cosmetics residue the scientists identified inside the porcelain containers of Princess Hwahyeop’s makeup box were skin care products that focused on whitening.           “As Confucian ideals were strong during the Joseon Dynasty, looking natural was defined as beautiful. Therefore, Joseon women made efforts to take care of their skin, and minimized the use of makeup,” said Lee Jun-bae from Cosmax.           “They used various natural ingredients to produce skin care products such as ground mung beans for facial scrubs, gourd stem juice for toner and apricot and peach oils for whitening. Most of the beauty products were for their skin and efforts to make them look fairer and healthier.”           Inside a porcelain bowl with a lotus scroll design, which is presumed to be from China, there was a solid, brown substance, which researchers revealed was a face cream used by the princess.           According to scientific testing, the brown material contained beeswax and other organic matters that moisturize the skin. In a white porcelain-covered bowl with wisteria design, which experts say is an import from Japan, was a white substance that may have been used as a face powder to make the skin look fairer. The main components of the white powder were lead carbonate and talc.           Although not found in Princess Hwahyeop’s beauty products, historical records state that Joseon women also used rice flour to make face powders. As for lipstick and blusher, it looks like the princess had used a red powder, which was found inside a Bunchae white porcelain cup with a floral design. The red powder contained cinnabar and safflower.              A bronze mirror was also found inside the makeup box. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]               There was also a comb, handheld mirror, a little black stick that could have been used as a brush to apply blush, and a porcelain bowl filled with dead ants, which to this day scientists have no idea what they were used for.           Although they weren’t inside Princess Hwahyeop’s makeup box, historical records state Joseon women also made toners using vegetables such as cucumber, gourd and motherwort. As for moisturizers, they used oils from animals and plants, the most popular being camellia oil. For their eyebrows, they mixed charcoal powder with sesame oil or camellia oil.           “Sadly, a lot of toxic heavy metals were mixed together with natural ingredients to enhance the products' effects and make them last longer,” said Chung Young-jae, Heritage Conservation and Restoration Professor at the Korea National University of Cultural Heritage.             For example, by mixing lead and rice flour, face powders lasted longer and the adhesive effect was said to be better. Researchers say it was the women of the rich families or the royal court who could afford to use such powder that were imported from China while common Joseon women just used rice flour, known as baekbun.             “Of course we won’t be adding any toxic ingredients for the Princess Hwahyup products, and will instead be adding alternative ingredients commonly used in modern day cosmetics production to enhance their effects.”           The three institutions also created a character of Princess Hwahyup to promote the brand.           “We’ll develop the containers and the character from here and hopefully launch the brand in November,” said Lee from Cosmax.            “Sadly due to the coronavirus outbreak, we can’t target foreign visitors to Korea, but when they begin to visit Korea, we will distribute the products at various retail stores and souvenir shops and let the world know about what kind of products served the skin of a Joseon princess.”           BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Director Kang Dae-kyu [JK FILM]                Director Kang Dae-kyu defines a good story on whether or not the narrative can be explained in one sentence.           “In that one sentence, listeners should be able to comprehend what the story is trying to say,” Kang said in an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily last week at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. “The sentence should also spark curiosity about what would happen after the end of that sentence.”           While director Kang’s latest film “Pawn” adapts certain clichés and familiar emotions to bring the audience to tears, he decided it was worth it if it meant the audience could reflect on the meaning of family. Despite the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic, the film managed to garner over 820,000 in ticket sales in the five days since its release on Sept. 29, which fell during the Chuseok holidays.            “It’s also related to the message of my last film ‘Harmony’ (2009) — although not related by blood, it’s about people who become families in extreme circumstances — it’s a new form of family, and through seeing [the characters] bond and saying goodbye, I thought it could [make the audience] look back on the meaning of family [and its importance].”           In “Pawn,” Doo-suk and Jong-bae are loan sharks who take a 9-year-old girl, Seungi, as security but end up raising the child. The trio, in a way, become a family, and Doo-suk in particular becomes quite taken with Seungi, which, over the course of many years, transforms into a paternal love.           “I don’t think universal emotions or clichés are necessarily bad,” Kang said. “Considering how ‘Pawn’ used them to carry the plot, I think it could actually be a plus — if the story has a sturdy enough plot I think the audience can naturally accept them.”           When asked whether or not Doo-suk’s unconditional love for Seungi may seem unrealistic, the director noted that it’s actually not that far off from reality.              Doo-seok (played by Sung Dong-il) and Jong-bae (played by Kim Hee-won) stare at the 9-year-old Seungi now without a mother after she was deported back to her homeland. [JK FILM]                             “I think that there’s at least one person who’s like a father figure for every person — someone who reaches out a helping hand no matter what,” Kang said. “Doo-suk didn’t feel that way for Seungi from the very start — in the beginning, it began with the tiniest bit of sympathy, a doubt, which through interaction, expanded to love. From Doo-suk’s point of view, this is natural, and I think that relationships can be like that. Like an unconditional love your parents give you, if you click with someone right away, you can become very close.”           Kang defines family as a presence who is always there for one another, and throughout the interview he persistently thanked those who supported and encouraged him in the making of “Pawn.”           The director brought the audience to tears with “Harmony,” which was about a group of female prisoners practicing in a choir to perform for their families at the end of the year, but after his debut feature film, he’s been absent from his position as a filmmaker and instead participated in writing the script for films such as “The Himalayas” (2015) and “Confidential Assignment"" (2017). “Pawn” is his second feature film to be released in local theaters.           “It took me so long to get ‘Pawn’ up on screens, and it was only possible because my friends and acquaintances supported me and told me not to give up on my dream — that is why I could be here today,” Kang said. “I think that’s what family is. It’s a little bit broad, but I think family is those who look over you until you fall asleep.”           Among those friends are actors Kim Yoon-jin and Na Moon-hee, who both featured as leads in “Harmony.” In this film, they portray Seungi’s mother and grandmother.             “They both obligingly said yes when I asked them, and I think it was their way of offering support especially because this was my next film after ‘Harmony,’” Kang said. “Na asked me if there was any role that she could do to help. That’s how much we connected in our prior film, and I believe we would be that kind of encouragement to one another — if there’s anything that we could do for each other, we would gladly do so.”              Doo-suk and adult Seungi (played by Ha Ji-won) from the film. [JK FILM]                               Kang mentioned several films that he referenced.           “There’s a Japanese film called ‘Like Father, Like Son’ which is about a family who one day comes across the truth that their son has been switched at the hospital — it throws up the question about what really matters — affection and love that the family feels for one another or heritage,” the director said. “There’s also an Israeli film called ‘Noodle,’ which is about a stewardess who is left with the child of her cleaning lady after she is deported back to her country. The stewardess and the people around the child do everything they can for the child to be reconnected to his mother, and it’s those little emotions that carry on the narrative. A lot of stories from books and movies influenced this one film.”             In essence, the message of both of Kang's films lie in family, but also touches upon social issues to spotlight social minorities or those embedded in social stereotypes — in the case of ‘Pawn,’ the story sheds light on ethnic Koreans from China in the '90s who were then mostly illegal aliens.           “I’ve always had interest, but never really did anything [for them],” the director said. “But as a filmmaker, my way of expressing my thoughts is in films, and I would start my story as a family drama which could go over to other genres and that could include social issues as well.           “I think [the reason my works are family-centered] also lies in my personal story as well,” Kang continued. “I was raised in a happy family, but my mother passed away when I was still a student, and just a while ago my father also passed away, and I realized how important it is to be there for each other when I can. It’s also a universal topic — there’s no one in the world who’s without a family — it’s just that they now exist in more various forms.”           BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "
11,PPP moves into new Yeouido headquarters,"

                           Acting head of the People Power Party (PPP) Kim Chong-in, center, gives a speech at the relocation ceremony of the party to its new headquarters in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Monday.  [YONHAP]                The People Power Party (PPP) on Monday held a ceremony to mark its relocation to a new headquarters in Yeouido, the heart of Korea’s politics where the National Assembly is located.             “The PPP must change and restore the people’s trust that we have lost over the past years,” Kim Chong-in, acting leader of the PPP, said. “We will win the Seoul and Busan mayoral by-elections in April next year and score another victory in the next presidential election.”            The largest opposition party held the ceremony in the morning at the Namjung Building, which it recently purchased.           “I am emotional that we’ve come to own a new headquarters after 16 years,” Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the PPP, said. “We will make a new start with new hope in this new home.”           Kim Seon-dong, the secretary general of the party, said he will never forget the day the conservative party sold its headquarters in 2004 and moved into a makeshift tent.           “I hope this new headquarters will become a space for diversity, loved by the public,” he said.             The history of the PPP’s relocations illustrates the party’s rise and fall during the past three decades.             From 1990 until 1996, the PPP’s predecessor, the Democratic Liberal Party, rented the Kukdong VIP Building in Yeouido, western Seoul. After it changed its name to New Korea Party, the conservative party purchased a site in front of the National Assembly in 1997, ahead of the 16th presidential election, and built its own building. The site is now the home of Hyundai Capital.             The party subsequently went through a period of political crises, triggered by the massive illegal presidential election fund scandal in 2002. In 2004, the party’s chairwoman, Park Geun-hye, sold the building and started using a makeshift tent as the headquarters. The party later moved into a building in Yeomchang-Dong, Gangseo District, miles away from Yeouido.           In 2007, it returned to Yeouido and rented the Hanyang Building as its headquarters. During its 11 years there, the party’s presidential candidates Lee Myung-bak and Park won two consecutive elections.             The party, however, moved out of Yeouido in 2018, following a series of political disasters. Park was impeached and removed from her presidency, and the party suffered crushing defeats in the 2017 presidential election and 2018 local election. It left Yeouido again in July 2018 to the nearby neighborhood of Yeongdeungpo to reinvent its image and reduce costs.             After rebranding its identity as the PPP, the party purchased the Namjung Building in July this year. It will use the third floor for the time being, operating a press center, conference rooms and a lecture hall. The other floors are occupied by existing tenants.             “We spent about 40 billion won [$34 million] to buy this building,” said a party official. The PPP said it raised the money by taking out loans, using city and provincial chapter buildings around the country. It plans to pay interest with the profits it makes renting out the building’s commercial facilities, the official said.             The PPP purchased the building from an English-language education company, Siwon School. The company purchased the building at the price of 29.5 billion won in January 2016.              BY ESTHER CHUNG, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

13,"A clean space is a clean mind, especially amid a pandemic","

     Park Seo-yu reorganizes her wardrobe as she spends more time at home with the outbreak of the coronavirus [KIM SANG-SEON]                A silver lining of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the discovery of new hobbies by many.            With people encouraged to stay home as much as possible, there has been a rise in the number of home chefs, while others have used the time to clean and reorganize their living spaces.            Studying and working from home has meant more and more people want their personal space to be clean, comfortable and convenient.             Earlier this month, 29-year-old Park Seo-yu did a major clean-out of her home with the aid of some cleaning experts.             Park lives in Daechi-dong, southern Seoul, with her family. From the outside, the home seemed to be in good order, but once the family and experts began opening drawers, it was a much different story.            Of all the spaces, the wardrobe was in particular disarray. ""I often give up looking for the clothes I want,"" said Park.           As the eight cleaning experts began to remove everything piled high inside wardrobes and dressers, a surprising amount of clothes was uncovered.               A scarf kept in a box as a gift, unopened, a brand-new shirt and skin scuba diving suits from 20 years ago were just some of the items found deep inside Park's closet. She said she didn't even remember that she owned such things.                Park's tidy wardrobe. Cleaning professionals recommend to hang clothes instead of folding them. [KIM SANG-SEON]               More odds and ends were found in the kitchen. A shaved ice machine Park used when she was a little kid, old sauces, out-of-date ingredients and faded lunchboxes were all unearthed. Bottles of vitamins that the family doesn't even remember buying were added to the trash pile.               The cleaning experts sorted every item into three categories: things to possess, share and discard.             Next was finding the right place for each group of objects. When organizing a vast volume of belongings, it's said that placing similar items together is best. In addition, the family's lifestyle needs to be considered. For example, it's better to install a dresser for towels near a bathroom.             The cleaning began at 9 a.m. and was finally finished by 6 p.m.            After hours of cleaning, there were enough bags of trash to fill up a small room.           ""I just can't believe that I've been living with all this stuff,"" said Park. ""I will try not going back to the past.""                Camping gear used to occupy the terrace of Park In-seon but it was recently tidied up. [PARK IN-SEON]                Park In-seon, 42, lives in an 89-square-meter (957-square-feet) apartment building with three bedrooms. But one of the rooms has become a warehouse from long ago. Old tables, chairs and junk occupies the room, so much so that he hardly ever enters it anymore.              The terrace was spacious when Park moved in but is now crammed with camping gear. The living room lost its identity after work desks were added alongside a large sofa.             Since Park and his wife have mostly been working from home because of the outbreak of the coronavirus, he desperately wanted to tidy up their living space.             Cleaning experts came in to assist Park cleaning up his house. According to the experts, the most important rule to remember is ""arranging all items so they are visible.""            File folding is a good way to follow this rule as it means all clothing items inside a drawer can be seen, rather than things being dumped at the bottom and remaining there for an unknown period of time.            If people make a habit of storing items deep inside their pantries or at the back of a closet, they easily forget what they have. They buy the same thing again and end up with more stuff than they have space for.            Park ended up getting rid of three large bags of trash along with an old sofa. Usable products were put up for sale on an online flea market.             ""My voice echoed in the space after I had cleaned the house. I felt like I just moved in,"" said Park.                Just by reorganizing furniture and small accessories, space becomes a lot more pleasant. [PARK IN-SEON]                The recent TV show ""The House Detox"" on tvN has been well received by those forced to spend more time at home.             The TV show's hosts visit a celebrity's house each week with a group of cleaning professionals and they help the celebrity clean and organize. Without major remodeling, the featured homes are starkly transformed with just cleaning and organizing. Each week's transformation is dramatic enough to encourage viewers to tidy up their own space.               The TV show was first aired in June and its viewership ratings have been gradually on the rise since.             According to Naver Trend, which analyzes keywords, the volume of searches for ""quarantine"" and ""organization"" increased drastically in August compared to January.            Purchases of home organization products, such as storage cube bins, have also been on the rise.                  The basics of the organization is making the right place for each group of goods. [KIM SANG-SEON]                Home décor smartphone application Today House said it saw a 250 percent increase in sales from the storage and organization category in August compared to January. The sales figure in August is four times higher compared to a year ago.             E-commerce website Gmarket, operated by eBay Korea, said sales of dressers and storage bins all surged. Online flea markets have also seen a jump in the number of users and the deals they make within the applications. Bungae Jangteo, also known as Pic & Go, is a platform for secondhand goods. The app said it saw a 25 percent increase in the number of deals made within the app between January and August, compared to the same period last year.             Choi Hee-suk, the head of Home Consulting, a company for house organization, said, ""Everyone leads a hectic life and they tend to ease their stress by shopping. But the house is soon filled with goods. No matter how many things you have, you can't use them on time if you don't organize them well.""             From an economical point of view, keeping your house organized is important because it prevents you from making unnecessary purchases.             For those wanting to declutter, here are some simple tips from the experts.             Take everything out of the home and sort them into three categories: things to possess, share and discard. Rearrange similar items into the same categories. While sorting, consider how frequently you use each item.           For example, seasonal items such as Christmas tree ornaments should be stored in an area that you don't access frequently.              Don't try to clean everything at once. Divide your home into sections and make a plan to take on one area at a time.                   File folding is recommended instead of stacking. [KIM SANG-SEON]               Another rule is to file fold instead of stack. You can file fold clothes, kitchen cloths and other textiles. It saves space and allows you to easily see what you are storing inside your drawers.             Lastly, try to make a habit of putting things back after each use.             The most important part of organization is to throw away things that you don't use that often.            An easy way to do this is to make a 'Think Box' and use it for things that you don't want to throw out right away. ""If you find yourself not using the item after two or three weeks, let it go,"" said Choi.             BY YOO JI-YOEN   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]           "

     A delivery rider delivers a packaged meal to a customer last month. As social distancing continues, the number of online transactions for food delivery has skyrocketed over recent months. [YONHAP]              Online shopping in August reached a record high, surpassing 14 trillion won ($12.03 billion) for the month for the first time as Covid-19 cases surged in metropolitan areas and the unprecedentedly long monsoon season kept people indoors.           According to data from Statistics Korea released Monday, total shopping transactions online in August amounted to 14.38 trillion won, a 27.5 percent jump from the same period a year ago.           Of that, transactions made on mobile jumped 27.8 percent on year to 9.33 trillion won, accounting for 64.8 percent of the online shopping transactions in August. The proportion of mobile shopping in the same month last year was 64.7 percent.           August marked the first time that monthly online transactions have surpassed 14 trillion won since Statistics Korea started collecting data in January 2013. Online transactions reached a record high in July, but that record was broken in just a month.           The jump in online transactions was led by food delivery orders, which increased 83 percent, or 758.7 billion won, on year. Purchases of food and beverages also jumped 44.4 percent on year. Online transactions were driven by improved demand for food delivery, home meal replacement products and health supplements.           As people spent more time at home due to the continued Covid-19 pandemic, household items, including furniture, saw a 59.3 percent growth in online transactions, followed by household and electronic devices, with 48.8 percent.           Purchases related to cultural and leisure services, including movie theaters, dipped 56.7 percent during the same period, while travel and transportation services similarly declined 51.4 percent, despite the vacation season in August.           Online purchases of cars and related items, like navigation systems and engine oil, increased 92 percent on year. Tesla, which only sells cars online, is seen to have contributed to that growth.

16,Defense Ministry chides PPP lawmakers for 'inappropriate' intelligence leaks,"

     Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), at a press conference Monday says the South Korean military had intelligence that showed North Korea had ordered the killing of a South Korean official at sea last month. [YONHAP]               Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense on Monday slammed an opposition lawmaker for leaking military intelligence pertaining to the North Korean killing of a South Korean fisheries official found at sea last month.             In a regular press briefing, Defense Ministry deputy spokesperson Col. Moon Hong-sik said Rep. Joo Ho-young’s public disclosure of information supposedly obtained through the military's eavesdropping of North Korean communications was “inappropriate” and “completely unhelpful to national security.”           The fact that the South Korean “military’s intelligence content is once again being reported on [in the media] without discretion is deeply regrettable,” Moon added.           According to another military official, who said the claims made by Joo, other lawmakers and media outlets on the issue were fattened with “speculative notions,” the military is considering taking legal action against the leakers for violating a law on military secrets.           Joo is the floor leader of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP). During a press conference on Monday, he cited “special military intelligence” to bolster his claim that a North Korean commanding officer had ordered a subordinate to shoot and kill the South Korean official, surnamed Lee, not long after Lee was discovered in the North’s waters on Sept. 22.             The exact orders relayed to the North Korean troops were to carry out “order 762,” Joo claimed, explaining that “762” referred to the 7.62-millimeter caliber rifles used by North Korean troops and was a code word authorizing the shooting.             The lawmaker went on to slam South Korea’s presidential office, the Blue House, for what he said was an attempt to “fabricate and distort” intelligence to cover up the military’s failure to act on its knowledge of what was happening to the official.             While Joo did not reveal the exact source of such information, he hinted the intelligence emerged from the Defense Ministry and the National Intelligence Service. Another PPP lawmaker, Rep. Han Ki-ho, later told a local outlet that the intelligence on the “762” order was obtained through the South Korean military’s wiretap on North Korean communications.             The comments appeared to corroborate several reports last week that South Korea was listening in on the conversation between the North Korean patrol boat that had captured the man, and a superior officer on the other side of the line.             According to Yonhap News Agency, which reported some details of the conversation, the North Korean captain of the boat tried to verify the order a second time after it was relayed, asking “Shoot and kill? Is this real?”           The tapped communication also revealed North Korean soldiers initially intended to rescue Lee, who had expressed a desire to defect to the North, according to the reports.           The Defense Ministry and Blue House on Thursday denied that words like “shooting” or “killing” appeared in the intelligence they had collected, but declined to confirm whether such information was gathered through wiretapping.             According to Deputy Spokesperson Moon on Monday, the South Korean military’s conclusion on the matter was arrived at not in real time, but “through the assembly of [several] limited pieces of intelligence” and a post-incident analysis.             Military officials further stressed the seriousness of danger posed by intelligence leaks, noting such exposures threatened to compromise its signals intelligence, known as Sigint, — a vital component of intelligence collection operations on North Korea.             False or misleading information propagated through the words of a sitting lawmaker also could erode the public’s confidence in the military, an official added.             As to uncovering the truth of what transpired that day, Seoul has proposed mounting a joint investigation with Pyongyang into the incident — an offer that may play into hopes that communications be restored between the two countries.             No reply has yet come from North Korea, which, despite apologizing for the “unfortunate” killing, claimed its soldiers were only following routine security guidelines.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
17,CU to start offering on-foot delivery service,"

     An on-foot delivery man uses his mobile navigation service to deliver items to a customer after picking them up at a CU convenience store. [BGF RETAIL]               BGF Retail’s CU convenience store franchise on Monday rolled out an on-foot delivery service in partnership with MG Playing.           When a delivery order is received on the Yogiyo delivery app, an employee from MG Playing, a company specialized in on-foot delivery services, within a 1-kilometer (0.6-mile) radius is assigned to deliver the product to the customer from the convenience store or other affiliated stores. If an MG Playing employee is not found within five minutes, an employee from a regular delivery company partnered with CU and Yogiyo takes the order instead.           MG Playing has been carrying out the service since 2019, providing delivery services for food chains including Paris Baguette, Dunkin’ and Baskin Robbins. The company is now affiliated with about 3,000 local stores.           CU is planning to implement the service at 1,000 convenience stores by the end of this month and expand it nationwide starting in November.           Since integrating Yogiyo into its business last year, CU has been forming partnerships with more companies to expand its portfolio of delivery agencies and introduce the 24-hour delivery service.           “In order to safely deliver the increased volume of orders, CU held hands with a company that can share its expertise and system,” said Jo Sung-hae, head of BGF Retail’s e-commerce team. “Going forward, CU will continue to understand a wide range of consumer needs to provide a service with a competitive edge in this growing industry for delivery service.”           In August, GS25 launched an on-foot delivery service called Woodel. While it is similar to CU’s initiative, ordinary people that are not associated with delivery companies take on the orders.           BY LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
18,"Total debt nears 5,000 trillion won before Covid-19 impact","

                  Korea's total debt has reached an all-time record of nearly 5,000 trillion won ($4,286 billion) under the current Moon Jae-in administration.             This figure, which includes government, personal and corporate debt, could further surge as many are heavily relying on loans to weather the impact of Covid-19.           According to data from the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Korea provided by People Power Party lawmaker Choo Kyoung-ho's office, total debt as of the end of 2019 amounted to 4,916.4 trillion won.           In just three years since the total debt exceeded 4,000 trillion won in 2016, 823 trillion won of debt has been added.           Total debt was more than 2.5 times the size of the nation’s GDP last year, which was 1,919 trillion won.           The largest debt came from the government, amounting to 2,198.1 trillion won. The figure also includes debt owed not only by the central and local government but also debt owed by state-owned institutions and companies as well as public servant and military officials pensions.           Individual debts including credit card purchases as of last year amounted to 1,600.3 trillion won while borrowing from companies amounted to 1,118 trillion won.           Both debts owed by individuals and companies are at an all-time high.           Opposition party lawmaker Choo said the record-size debt is the result of the government’s reckless spending, low interest rates and the sluggish economy.           The bigger concern is the significant expansion of these debts this year on all fronts, largely due to Covid-19.           This year the national debt is expected to add 846.9 trillion won, in part due to the four supplementary budgets that have been approved.           Debt accumulated by individuals and companies has also shot up as the global pandemic creates unprecedented economic hardships.           In the first half of this year, household borrowing amounted to 1,637.3 trillion won. In just six months, 37 trillion won worth of fresh loans have been borrowed, a 2 percent increase.           Considering the surge of Covid-19 cases in August that led to many businesses and households being impacted by social distancing, that debt by the end of this year will likely see a sharp rise.           Companies in the first half of this year borrowed 1,233.8 trillion won of loans. That’s a 10 percent increase compared to the whole of 2019 at 1,118 trillion won.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

20,Giants push for playoff spot as Wiz take surprise second place,"

     Lotte Giants infielder Oh Yoon-suk, right, celebrates after hitting a grand slam during a game against the Hanwha Eagles at Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan on Sunday. [YONHAP]                With a four-game winning streak, the Lotte Giants continue to keep their slim chance of heading to the postseason alive.            Capping off the four-game winning streak, Giants' infielder Oh Yoon-suk made history on Sunday against the Hanwha Eagles, becoming the first person in the history of the KBO to hit for the cycle with a grand slam.            During the Giants’ game against the Hanwha Eagles at Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan, Oh became only the 27th player to hit for the cycle in KBO history, adding in a grand slam for good measure. While there have been 26 other players in the KBO to hit for the cycle, Oh is believed to be the first person ever to do so in the same game as a grand slam.           Hitting for the cycle is when a batter hits a single, double, triple and a home run in the same game, considered one of the hardest feats in baseball. A grand slam is a home run hit with runners on every single base, giving the batter four RBIs in one swing of the bat. Doing both in one game is so rare that only nine players are believed to have managed the feat in the history of the MLB, and only one in Japan's NPB.           Getting assigned as the Giants’ leadoff and second baseman, Oh started off the game by hitting a double against Eagles’ starter Park Ju-hong. At the bottom of the second, with two outs and a runner on second, the 28-year-old added a single. Then, at the bottom of the third, with the Giants already holding a 5-1 lead, Oh hit a grand slam off of Eagles' pitcher Kim Jong-soo.           Finally, Oh completed the cycle with a triple at the bottom of the fifth.           Remarkably, Oh's grand slam was only the fourth home run of his career and his third this season.           Despite that big 14-5 victory on Sunday, the Giants still have some work to do. They are one game behind the sixth-ranked Kia Tigers and three games behind the fifth-ranked Doosan Bears.          Aside from the Giants, the Bears had a big weekend, switching spots with the Tigers. As the Bears swept their series against the Tigers, the Bears are now back to fifth.           But the Bears weren't the only team to switch spots in the regular season standing. Over the week, the KT Wiz moved up to second, complete unknown territory for the newest team in the league. They brought down the Heroes to get one game ahead and take second, but the chances of them catching up to the NC Dinos are slim as the Changwon club now has an eight-game lead.           Looking at the regular season standing this season, the new teams are making an upset. The top three teams in the KBO standing are the youngest teams in the league, with the Wiz joining the KBO last, in 2015.           The Wiz’s performance stands out this season as they’ve been considered one of the weaker teams in the KBO. Since joining the KBO in 2015, the Suwon club finished dead last for three seasons, ninth in 2018 and sixth last year.           The KBO will continue their regular season with all 10 clubs playing three-game series starting at 6:30 p.m on Tuesday.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]         "
21,Son scores two as Spurs smash through Manchester United,"

     Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur, right, celebrates with Harry Kane after scoring Spurs' second goal of the match against Manchester United at Old Trafford in Manchester, England on Sunday. [REUTERS/YONHAP]               One week after getting pulled out of a game with a suspected hamstring injury, Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur is back.            During Spurs' English Premier League match against Manchester United on Sunday, Son scored two goals — in the seventh and 37th minutes — to help his side pick up a big 6-1 victory at Old Trafford.           Just one week earlier, Son was pulled out of Spurs’ match against Newcastle at the end of the first half. Originally, it was reported that Son was expected to miss a couple of matches, but the Korean striker was back on the pitch and ready to go on Sunday.           Despite limited training time after his injury, Son continued his hot streak.           It was actually Manchester United who scored the opener with Bruno Fernandes' penalty only two minutes into the match. Spurs quickly responded as Tanguy Ndombele scored an equalizer in the fourth minute, just two minutes after United scored the opener. Then, just three minutes after that, in the seventh minute, Son scored Spurs’ second goal of the match, assisted by Harry Kane.           Spurs were given an advantage as United’s Anthony Martial was given a red card, meaning Spurs had one more player than United for the rest of the match. And they made sure to take advantage.           In the 30th minute, Kane scored Spurs’ third goal of the match, this time assisted by Son. To finish off the first half, Son scored another in the 37th minute to extend Spurs’ lead to 4-1, assisted by Serge Aurier.           “Some magic in my hamstring,” Son told Spurs TV after the match. “Obviously, I was injured. I was worried about [that]. I wanted to play this big game and I want to help the team. And I was treated very, very hard [during] training. I couldn’t train hard because I had a small injury. But, no. What can I say with this performance? With this result? I’m more than happy to win this game and buzzing.”           Once the second half of the match kicked off, Spurs continued to score more and more. Aurier scored the fifth goal of the match and then Kane added another in the 79th, scoring a penalty.           Son was substituted for Ben Davies in the 73rd minute of the match.           With the win, Spurs are ranked sixth in the 2020-21 Premier League standing with two wins, a draw and a loss, totaling seven points.           “We say United’s a big team,” Son said, “and [we] have to be clinical. What Harry says, that’s what we need. You have to be clinical. Score the goals, assist and that’s what we’ve done today. I think this is what we need for the team. I’m so happy that I assisted Harry as well because I felt a little bit pressure because he gave me so [many] assists, but I didn’t.”           Once again, Son and Kane showed perfect teamwork as they each added assists for each other’s goals. The pair have proven lethal since Son joined Spurs in 2015, teaming up on more than 25 Premier League goals, more than any other pair in the league over the same period.             Even this season, when Son scored four goals during Spurs’ Premier League match against Southampton on Sept. 20, Kane assisted all four.             “For especially for this season and obviously I say before I’m a little bit sad that he didn’t score the second one,” Son said. “But we won the game. I’m buzzing to get three points here, [at] Old Trafford.”           Such a big win at Old Trafford is a memorable victory for Son as he grew up watching former Korean footballer Park Ji-sung play for the club. Although Manchester United may not be off to the best start to the season, they are a dominant team in Premier League history, as they’ve won 20 Premier League titles, 12 FA Cups and three UEFA Champions Leagues.           Sunday's defeat was the first time since 1957 that United have conceded four goals in the first half. It also ties the record for the club's worst-ever Premier League defeat, originally set with a 6-1 defeat against Manchester City in 2011.           “As a kid, you grew up watching this stadium,” Son said. “I mean for me, especially, because [Park] Ji-sung was playing here. And then you naturally watch so many games for United. But you see this statement we beat them 6-1. It’s just incredible. I’m really proud of the team and proud of myself as well.”           Following the victory, Spurs’ head coach Jose Mourinho also complimented the team’s performance.             “It was an amazing performance,” Mourinho was quoted as saying on the Spurs' website. “I can imagine some anti-Spurs people will say it was 11 against 10 for the second half, but I have to say we were so much better than them for the whole of the first half, 11 against 11, lots of confidence in the team, losing 1-0 to a silly penalty, no problem. The team just played, played, played, reacted, kept playing, playing, playing and when we felt weakness, we went for the jugular, and you don’t do that if you are not an ultra-confident team.”           Spurs will continue their season with another Premier League match against West Ham on Sunday, Oct. 19, local time, or 12:30 a.m., on Oct. 20 in Korea. This time, Spurs will be heading back to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]                           "

                           Hidden cash found at the residency of one of the tax evaders being displayed on screen during the National Tax Service's press briefing held at Sejong Government Complex on Monday. [YONHAP]               A lawyer in Gangnam avoided paying taxes despite his huge income. The tax agency started tracking the lawyer on a tip that he was living in an expensive apartment and driving a luxury vehicle.           Tax agents eventually tracked him down at an apartment in Bundang, Gyeonggi, where they found 36 million won ($30,800) in cash stashed in a bookshelf. Agents also found membership to a golf club in Japan, gold bars, luxury watches and bags worth 200 million won.           A clothing manufacturer declared his business bankrupt and shut it down, despite owing the government a huge amount of tax. He reopened the same business at the same spot but under the name of his brother-in-law to try to avoid the tax agency.           The agency was able to prove that he was still the actual owner of the business through big data.           The tax agency said it will not only report the tax evader to the prosecutors’ office but also the brother-in-law as an accomplice.             The National Tax Service on Monday said it is currently investigating 812 wealthy people suspected of being repeated tax offenders.           Not only will they actively track down offenders, but also look into the financial status of relatives.           It especially noted that big data analysis is being used in investigations, which not only looks into the suspect’s financial dealings, but also into personal spending.           The tax agency noted that big data have played a significant role, helping to speed up the process contributing to the efficiency and accuracy of investigations.             Through big data analysis it was able to find the actual residence of 24 tax evaders among 28 suspected of using a fake address.           The tax agency in a statement said that the accuracy in tracking down the actual residency of tax evaders was 85.7 percent, which is said to be relatively accurate.           The tax agency said it has strengthened its investigation against tax evaders despite the coronavirus pandemic.             As a result, in the first eight months of this year, it was able to collect 1.5 trillion won worth of unpaid taxes, which is a 14.6 percent increase, or 191.6 billion won more than the same period a year ago.             Additionally, the cases that it was able to turn over to the prosecutors’ offices amounted to 290, 60 more than the same period a year ago.           The tax agency said starting next year a stricter rule will be applied to repeat offenders.             When found evading taxes, repeat offenders will be subject to imprisonment for up to 30 days.             BY LEE HO-JEONG [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]         "

[TV CAPTURE]               BTS and Blackpink weren't the only Korean pop stars who were the talk of the town during the Chuseok holidays.            The name Na Hoon-a, who is a 73-year-old veteran singer-songwriter and dubbed the ""Emperor of the Trot,"" appeared on numerous social media accounts and Internet communities, even in those of the younger generation, after his first TV concert in 14 years was aired on KBS 2TV on Wednesday night.           Over the last few years, tickets for Na's offline concerts have been called ""the most sought-after gift for old parents"" because the singer, who has a 54-year career and scores of hit songs including ""Japcho (Wild weeds)"" (1982) has shown his perfectionism on stage in a limited number of concerts. The 30,000 tickets for his May 2019 concert sold out within eight minutes after they were released.             This time, ""so as to comfort and cheer up many people depressed by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Na agreed to hold a free TV concert, according to the state-run KBS TV. The veteran singer had originally planned to hold an outdoor concert with an audience. However, as the number of the daily Covid-19 cases surged, he agreed to hold his first-ever livestream concert with 1,000 online viewers from various parts of the world including Korean emigrants in Japan, Australia and Zimbabwe, which was recorded to be aired later.            Changing into various clothes ranging from hanbok to ripped jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt, Na sang about 30 songs including his famous hits such as ""Musiro (At any time)"" and ""Hongsi (Persimmon)"" and new songs including ""Tes Hyeong (Brother Socrates),"" whose lyrics are Na's questions to the ancient Greek philosopher.                   The concert took place on Sep. 23 and then was aired on TV on Wednesday. It gained a viewership rating of 29 percent, which is exceptionally high for a concert, according to market tracker Nielsen Korea. On Thursday, Na-related terms accounted for half of the 10 most-searched words on Korea's biggest Internet portal Naver. Even on the list of the most-searched words by users in their 20s, Na's new song ""Tes Hyeong"" ranked second and his name ranked fourth. ""Wow, it is my first time to see him, but this grandpa looks awesome!"" wrote a user of a teenagers' community on the portal Nate Pann.             Well-known politicians including Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) and Jeju Gov. Won Hee-ryong of the opposition People Power Party (PPP) wrote on their social media accounts that they were really cheered up by Na's concert. Many netizens paid attention to not only Na's songs but also his comments during the concert, saying ""We are now much tired [of the pandemic]. I have never seen a monarch or a president who really risked their lives in history. The [ordinary] people like you have protected this country... You are the best...We can overcome this pandemic.""            Some netizens and opposition party politicians interpreted this as a roundabout compliant about the current administration's policies, while supporters of the ruling party opposed the interpretation. This controversy made the concert even more viral.           Due to the unexpected huge popularity of the concert, KBS 2TV hurried to make an unscheduled program ""Na Hoon-a Special,"" which features behind-the-scenes footage from the concert, along with the re-airing of the concert, on Saturday night. Although it was aired at a relatively late hour, the special program gained an 18.7 percent viewership rating, according to Nielsen Korea.             During the program, Na talked about his first embarrassment when he had to choose to hold an online concert which he was completely unfamiliar with.

26,"Number of people affected by faulty flu shots jumps to over 2,300","

     A patient receives a flu shot at a hospital in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul, on Sept. 28, which she will pay for. [YONHAP]         The number of people who may have been injected with a flu vaccine that was left at room temperature instead of being refrigerated has jumped to over 2,300, of whom 12 have exhibited “abnormal” symptoms, health authorities said.           Officials said Saturday none of the 12 people were in serious condition and that most had recuperated. Their symptoms included a fever, cough and sore throat. Three are below the age of 10, two between 10 and 19, three in their 30s, three in their 50s and one in his or her 60s.             The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said in a statement that by Friday, a total of 2,303 people nationwide were suspected to have been injected with the faulty shots, though it was unclear how many of those patients actually received a shot that was left at room temperature.             On Sept. 22, the KDCA sent jitters across the nation when it announced that a government project offering free flu shots to the nation’s old and young had been abruptly halted after health authorities detected problems in deliveries. It turned out some vaccines were left at room temperature as they were being shipped to medical facilities, instead of being refrigerated.             The vaccines were supposed to be kept at temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to sustain their potency.             At the time, the KDCA said the blunder was found among a batch of vaccines that were to be given to five million people aged between 13 and 18 starting Sept. 22. The vaccines in question had not been administered to anyone, the KDCA said, because they pulled the plug on Sept. 21 and alerted medical facilities not to use the shots on anyone.             That turned out to be false.           On Sept. 25, the KDCA backtracked on its earlier statement, saying some medical facilities were found to have already used the vaccines on their patients.             The number of people who may have come into contact with flu shots that were left at room temperature has been growing ever since. They have been found in 280 hospitals and clinics in 15 different provinces and metropolitans across the country so far, all but Gangwon and Ulsan.             Among 2,303 people counted by the KDCA as of Friday, 673 received their shots in Gyeonggi, followed by 361 in Gwangju, 326 in North Jeolla, 214 in Incheon, 161 in North Gyeongsang and 149 in Seoul.           While investigating the delivery blunder, the KDCA said it discovered serious problems in vaccine management on the part of hospitals and clinics, which, to some extent, was why the faulty shots were distributed to the general public. Some facilities were found to have mixed the free flu shots sponsored by the government with other flu shots that people who aren’t covered in the government’s free vaccine scheme had to pay for.             Supposedly due to this reason, the faulty shots were given as recently as on Sept. 29, a week after the KDCA pulled the plug on the free flu program.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

Doing both in one game is so rare that only nine players are believed to have managed the feat in the history of the MLB, and only one in Japan's NPB.           Getting assigned as the Giants’ leadoff and second baseman, Oh started off the game by hitting a double against Eagles’ starter Park Ju-hong. At the bottom of the second, with two outs and a runner on second, the 28-year-old added a single. Then, at the bottom of the third, with the Giants already holding a 5-1 lead, Oh hit a grand slam off of Eagles' pitcher Kim Jong-soo.          Finally, Oh completed the cycle with a triple at the bottom of the fifth.           Remarkably, Oh's grand slam was only the fourth home run of his career and his third this season.            The Giants picked up a big 14-5 victory against the Eagles and are now on a four-game winning streak.           By hitting for the cycle, Oh became the 27th player to complete the feat and the second player this season to achieve it. On May 30, Kim Hye-seong of the Kiwoom Heroes also hit for the cycle, during a game against the KT Wiz at Gocheok Sky Dome in western Seoul. At the time, Kim became the second-youngest player in KBO history to hit for the cycle.           Oh joined the Giants as a developing player in 2015, after graduating from Yonsei University. Although he appeared in 29 games for the Giants in 2015, he failed to leave an impression as he joined the Sangmu Baseball team following his rookie season.           Once he returned to the Giants in 2018, things got worse, as he appeared in 13 games and finished the season with a .273 batting average with no home runs or RBIs. As a utility player, Oh has been playing a number of positions for the Giants and last year, he played his career high number of games, at 79, to finish the season with a .222 batting average with a home run and 21 RBIs.           Although the season hasn’t ended, Oh is having a career high as he has already appeared in 45 games for the Giants and added his name to the history book.             BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorm@joongang.co.kr]         "
28,LG Wing arrives Oct. 6 at just over 1 million won,"

     A model holds up LG Electronics' ""swiveling"" Wing smartphone. [LG ELECTRONICS]                     LG Electronics' rotating Wing smartphone will be released in Korea on Oct. 6 with a price tag of 1.09 million won ($930).           The electronics maker said Sunday overseas sales will start in the United States on Oct. 15, without specifying a price tag for that market. Verizon will be the Wing’s exclusive U.S. seller.           The official price tag of 1,098,900 won makes LG Electronics’ Wing significantly cheaper than rival high-end smartphones. Apple's iPhone 11 Pro costs 1,390,000 won and 11 Pro Max costs 1,550,000 won, while Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Z Fold2 was released at 2.4 million won. The Wing also comes with a smartphone case and earphones.           The Wing is the first model in LG’s “Explorer Project” initiative to explore innovative form factors. Even as competitors like Samsung, Huawei and Motorola have been searching for ways to fold a single wider screen in the race for a new form factor, LG has stuck to the concept of “dual screen” phones, with two separate screens that can be used simultaneously.           In a January press event, LG Electronics CEO Kwon Bong-seok said it’s not an issue of technical capability, but doubts over the “marketability” of folding smartphones that has kept the company away from the competition.           The Wing is LG’s first handset to bring together two screens into one device. LG's previous two dual screen phones, the V50 ThinQ 5G and V60 ThinQ 5G, came with separate, attachable secondary screens.             Among the Wing’s 6.8-inch and 3.9-inch OLED screens, the larger top display can be rotated 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, exposing a smaller, square-sized screen underneath that, when deployed, making the entire thing look like a ""T.""             “Displays are the largest portion in costs among smartphone components. From that perspective, our aggressive pricing strategy reflects our drive to take away that unnecessary price bubble,” LG said in a Sunday statement.           LG’s latest premium segment phone comes with four cameras, three of which are in the back, ranging from 12 to 64 megapixels. It is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G 5G and contains 8 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of internal memory.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON  [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
29,Battery system blamed as Kona EVs start bursting into flames,"






     Hyundai Motor's Kona Electric. [HYUNDAI MOTOR WEBSITE]               A Hyundai Kona electric vehicle (EV) burst into flames in the early hours of Sunday morning while parked in the underground parking lot of an apartment in Daegu, the 12th such incident since the model's launch in 2018.           The vehicle was parked in front of a slow EV charger when the blaze started at 2:47 a.m. The fire was extinguished in 10 minutes, with residents of the complex made to wait outside until it was considered safe. The incident caused zero injuries but the entire vehicle was damaged in the fire.           The National Forensic Service plans to investigate the case and is considering possibility of the EV catching fire after completing charging.           The Hyundai Kona was the second best-selling EV in Korea in the first half, behind Tesla’s Model 3. More than 30,000 Kona EVs have been sold in Korea since 2018, and the model has also proven popular overseas, especially in Europe.             Despite that success, consumers are becoming increasingly concerned over the string of fires. Twelve cases so far had been reported by local media, starting from the fire that took place in Hyundai’s Ulsan production plant in May 2018. Overseas, one Kona EV caught fire and exploded in a garage in Canada on July 2019, blowing off the garage door and roof.           Sunday’s incident happened just a week after another Kona EV caught fire in Jeju Island on Sept. 26. The vehicle was also parked, connected to an EV charger inside the parking lot of an apartment building. But the circumstances of the 12 domestic cases are not all consistent: Some were connected to chargers when the fire broke out while some were just parked normally.           Acknowledging that repeated fires occurring from the same model is unusual, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport initiated an investigation into the burnt Kona EV vehicles in September last year. The results have not been disclosed yet.             Hyundai Kona EVs use battery cells from LG Chem, Korea’s largest battery maker. But Prof. Kim Pil-soo, a professor at Daelim University College department of automotive engineering, says the defect is likely to be in Hyundai’s battery management system.             “EV batteries are like a combination of small containers tied together. [The management system] should charge these small containers on an even level and consume power in the same stable way. The problem occurs when that balance is broken. If the battery can’t withstand the energy stored, that’s when the fire occurs regardless of whether the vehicle is plugged or not plugged into the charger,” said Kim.           “Batteries in each vehicle are designed to have the optimal battery size, capacity, charging speed and cooling system that works best on that specific model. Kona’s battery just isn’t the case.”           An online petition posted on the Blue House website on Sept. 3 accused Hyundai Motor of putting in more effort to conceal the fires instead of clarifying the reason behind them.           “The government is committing massive budgets to boost eco-friendly automobiles. But this vehicle is exported to many countries — there needs to be a thorough inspection to see whether it is properly made,” the petition said. It received 7,020 signatures and did not meet the 200,000 threshold required to receive an official response from the Blue House.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON, KIM JUNG-SEOK   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]         "
30,"Rising housing prices based on misplaced anxiety, LH CEO says","

     Korea Land and Housing Corporation CEO Byeon Chang-heum [KOREA LAND AND HOUSING CORPORATION]               Rising real estate prices are the result of misplaced anxiety over housing supply shortages, according to Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH) CEO Byeon Chang-heum.            “There is enough land to build apartments,” Byeon said, during a recent interview with the JoongAng Ilbo.           But the chaos in the real estate market, which includes Seoul, continues. The steep upward trajectory for housing price appears to have passed its peak, but record prices are still emerging. The average jeonse, or long-term housing rental deposit, price for apartments in Seoul has been on the rise for a year and five months, while prices have been jumping for low-rise multi-unit housing and officetels.           Since taking office in mid-2017, President Moon Jae-in has repeatedly attempted to rein in the heated real estate market, introducing 23 sets of real estate measures.             Experts have consistently argued cooling off the market requires an increase in supply, especially in the greater Seoul area.             As part of the Aug. 8 measures, the government said it would provide housing for 132,000 households, 70 percent of which are in the hands of the state-run LH.             Byeon recently sat down with the JoongAng Ilbo to share his perspective on the local real estate market.                   Q. What do you mean when you say there’s a sufficient supply of housing in Seoul?          A. I have looked into numerous statistics. In the last three years, on average, the number of apartments that have gone into construction or been completed in Seoul has been slightly higher than the average between 2013 and 2016.           On average, 43,000 households have moved into the newly constructed apartments in each of the last three years. That’s higher than the 32,000 annual average between 2013 and 2016. However, there are perceptions that there is shortage in the supply of apartments in Seoul because of regulations. They are mostly psychological concerns.               Q. One of the major tools that could be used to supply apartments in Seoul is reconstruction and major [zone-level] redevelopment that is currently restricted by regulations. Wouldn’t a slight lifting of regulations help?          A. The government is well aware [of this option]. However, the risks of having apartment prices hiking up as a result of deregulation is too high. For example, raising the floor-area ratio will immediately have the effect of increasing the number of apartments that could be supplied. However, the additional units that will be built [from reconstruction or district redevelopment] will result in raising the prices of the apartments, which will lead to raising the housing prices of surrounding neighborhoods.           This is not a problem limited to the apartment complex that is reconstructed or redeveloped, as it will have an immediate ripple effect on the overall housing market. This is because unlike overseas, where there are different types of housing, in Korea, there’s not many options.               Q. Is there a way to increase housing supply in Seoul besides reconstruction or redevelopment measures?            A. It is true there is a shortage of land in Seoul to build houses. However, there are many ways to supply new houses.       One such way is to develop transit-friendly neighborhoods or jjokbangchon — neighborhoods with small houses whose rooms are divided into smaller spaces for accommodating low-income people.           In Seoul alone there are 300 subway stations. These areas surprisingly have low floor-area ratios.           We could utilize these areas in supplying houses.           It’s the same with jjokbangchon, where there’s a high concentration of two- to three-story housing. In the past when we talked about improving the housing environment, the focus was on making small minor changes like changing the door knobs. But today the government can purchase the land and build new houses.           LH is currently carrying out restoration projects in five jjokbangchons in Seoul including Yongsan.           While 30 percent of the city land in New York is used for residential purposes, in Seoul it’s less than 5 percent. One shouldn’t worry about housing supplies in Seoul.               Q. The government’s real estate measure on Aug. 4 included a reconstruction and zone-level redevelopment that involved the intervention of the government in supplying apartments in the greater Seoul area. However, there are concerns as these projects, in order to be executed, need the willing participation of the private sector. Is it not because of the government intervention that participation from the private sector is low?      A. Whether it is reconstruction or a zone-level redevelopment, basically it is a project where the landlords exercise their personal property rights.           However, because it has to be approved by the government, it is a public-interest project.           And as such the public-interest developer must play an aggressive role.           However, there’s a widely accepted perception that reconstruction and redevelopment is a real estate investment development business, which is wrong.           If the public interest entity leads, it will immediately reduce the financial costs [of the reconstruction and redevelopment project]. Various application and licensing process will be shortened and there will be no room for conflict [among landlords] creating corruption.           If we actively inform the members of the reconstruction and redevelopment projects, we expect participation [from the private sector] to increase.               Q. Will the third generation of new towns help stabilize the housing prices in Seoul?          A. The new towns closely border Seoul. Changneung in Goyang, Gyeonggi, Gyeyang in Incheon and Daejang in Bucheon borders Seoul. Gyosan in Hanam is only 2.2 kilometers (1.4 miles) from Seoul and Wangsook in Namyangju is only 3.5 kilometers from Seoul.           However, because many of the development-restricted zones [greenbelt] are located between these new towns and Seoul, many people feel as though they are located far from Seoul and feel unfamiliar.           Yet as all have major public transportation, it only takes 30 minutes to travel to major areas within Seoul.           Wangsook in Namyangju alone has six rail lines. It takes only 15 minutes to travel to Seoul Station, 20 minutes to Yeouido and Gangnam.           We could expect the new towns to disperse the housing concentration in Seoul.               Q. Will homebuyers applying early on yet-to-be constructed apartments stabilize the market? Wouldn’t it lead to rising jeonse prices as homebuyers wait?          A. Yes, there is a possibility that jeonse prices would go up, [contributing to the shortage of such long-term rental apartments while their apartment is being built]. However, as these people continue to live in jeonse, they wouldn’t buy an apartment, which will contribute to keeping a lid on Seoul apartment prices.                 Q. The anxiety of people who don’t own a house is high, and has resulted in recent panic-buying.          A. There is a huge flow in the housing market, where once the recovery and upturn period ends, a sharp decline happens. When the first and second new towns were supplied [between the late 1980s and early 1990s] and the third new towns were created [in the mid-2000s] apartment prices for seven to eight years were on the decline.           Until 2022, 370,000 units, which accounts for 44 percent of apartments that are to be supplied under the third new town projects, will be supplied. The opportunities for those that don’t currently own homes will grow significantly. They shouldn’t be nervous.             BY CHOI HYUN-JU   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
31,Conservative protesters stay away as police close Gwanghwamun,"

     Police buses and officers block access to Gwanghwamun Square on Saturday to prevent antigovernment protesters from gathering. [YONHAP]         No large-scale antigovernment rally was held in downtown Seoul Saturday as health authorities had feared, though several right-wing demonstrators protested against President Moon Jae-in in small groups or alone across the capital.           Health officials had been worried that conservative activists might show up in huge mobs in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, on Saturday — Korea’s Foundation Day — like they did on Aug. 15, when the country celebrated Liberation Day. Both were national holidays.           More than 600 coronavirus patients were linked to the Aug. 15 rally, which was estimated to have included nearly 20,000 people, making it one of the largest clusters Korea has seen during the coronavirus pandemic.           During the Chuseok holidays, daily coronavirus cases in the country mostly hovered around 60 to 80 cases.           Over 100 conservative civic groups had planned to take to the streets in downtown Seoul in or near Gwanghwamun last Saturday, but protest permits were all rejected by police, which took the cue from the Seoul Metropolitan Government by banning any rallies in the city involving 10 people or more through Oct. 11 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Seoul government also designated no-rally zones in many parts of the downtown Seoul area, where even rallies involving fewer than 10 people were prohibited.           Several rally organizers tried to work around the restriction by using their cars and protesting from the vehicles, dubbed “car rallies,” but even that was prohibited by police, who warned that participants could have their driver’s licenses suspended or revoked.           With some civic groups still refusing to back down, the police completely cordoned off Gwanghwamun Square with police buses and steel fences last Saturday to block anyone from passing by, installed 90 checkpoints at entries to Seoul to screen vehicles, and deployed nearly 800 police officers across the capital to prevent any large political masses.           From 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., even subways didn’t stop at stations near Gwanghwamun Square, measures that affected Gwanghwamun Station on line No. 5, City Hall Station on lines No. 1 and 2 and Gyeongbokgung Station on line No. 3.           Several protesters who tried to sneak by police to enter Gwanghwamun Square were stopped, and some groups held small press conferences in the vicinity with no more than nine people. A few demonstrators resorted to holding pickets a few yards away in one-person demonstrations.                            Only two conservative groups were allowed to hold car rallies in Seoul on Saturday after the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in their favor, albeit under strict restrictions: Only nine cars were allowed to join, with one person in each vehicle; drivers couldn’t roll down their windows to chant; they all had to follow traffic rules and stick to their planned route; and submit a legal document promising they would abide by the rules.           One group passed by the residences of former Justice Minister Cho Kuk and current Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, who are each involved in corruption scandals involving their children.           Police said in a statement that no serious clashes occurred between police and protesters.            The ruling Democratic Party (DP) praised police efforts in a statement, saying it was a necessary step to protect the general public from the coronavirus. The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) slammed the Moon administration, calling it a “dictatorship.”           Conservative groups have warned they would take to the streets in downtown Seoul this Friday and Saturday, raising tensions with police all over again.           No serious surge in daily Covid-19 cases was reported over Chuseok, though the figures did rise compared to right before the holiday, which kicked off Wednesday.           There were 77 new cases Wednesday, 63 Thursday, 75 Friday and 64 Saturday. As of Saturday at midnight, Korea had counted 421 deaths, 21,845 recovered patients and 24,091 coronavirus cases.           Central health authorities Saturday said they have detected two Covid-19 cases so far from people who have traveled during the holidays, both to Busan.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

     U.S. President Donald Trump, who is being treated for Covid-19 in a military hospital outside Washington, speaks from his hospital room, in this still image taken from a video supplied by the White House, Oct. 3, 2020. [REUTERS/YONHAP]               U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo canceled a scheduled visit to South Korea, the State Department announced Sunday following President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis last week.            Pompeo will still be traveling to Tokyo, Japan, from Oct. 4 to 6 to attend a foreign ministers’ meeting with other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as Quad, read a department statement, but a planned trip to Seoul was apparently removed from the itinerary.             Last month, officials in Seoul said Pompeo was expected to visit South Korea for two days from Oct. 7 to discuss regional security issues and denuclearization negotiations with North Korea, which would have been his first visit to the country in two years.             No official explanation was provided for the rescheduling, though the decision may be linked to Trump's positive test result, announced early Thursday.             Pompeo was, however, expecting to travel to Asia again in October — “now just a few weeks off,” according to a State Department release.            South Korea’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday said it received notification of the scheduling change from Washington, adding it looked forward to a visit from the secretary as soon as possible.             The U.S. chief diplomat’s canceled trip to Seoul stands as just one of many foreign policy complications stemming from Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis, which plunged Washington into confusion and raised alarm about the security implications of the president’s illness so close to a presidential election.           Trump received a litany of sympathetic get-well messages from leaders around the world, including one from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who state media said wished the president and first lady swift recoveries.           “He sincerely hoped that they would be recovered as soon as possible. He hoped they will surely overcome it,” said an English-language report from the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).             The White House has not confirmed it has received Kim’s message.           Trump is currently undergoing treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, and appeared in a video message Saturday in which he said he was feeling better and would continue campaigning for his reelection this November.             Kim’s message appears to be aimed at just that, expressing goodwill toward Trump in the chance that the firebrand president is kept in office by American voters next month, though polls predict his chances are narrower than his Democratic Party rival Joe Biden.             The two heads of state are well known pen pals, exchanging dozens of letters in between their three meetings throughout 2018 to 2019, which journalist Bob Woodward described as containing fawning expressions and phrases resembling medieval “declarations of personal fealty.”           Such personal chemistry aside, no deal emerged between Pyongyang and Washington throughout the course of the three summits due to their unbridgeable positions about the scope and sequencing of North Korea’s denuclearization process.             But the letters continued to be traded, with Trump in March offering U.S. assistance to the North on combatting the coronavirus pandemic.             Washington has also extended such a proposal through other diplomatic channels between the two countries, but so far no reply has materialized from Pyongyang, which insists it has no Covid-19 cases on its soil.             Trump’s illness is likely to complicate the process further, effectively ruling out the option of high-level negotiations with the North and delaying discussions with South Korea on the matter.             Seoul’s presidential office, the Blue House, revealed South Korean President Moon Jae-in also sent a message of sympathy to Trump and his wife on Friday.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
34,Speculations mount that North may reveal new weapon during parade,"

     North Korean missiles displayed at a military parade in Feb. 8, 2018, on the 70th anniversary of the country's armed forces. [YONHAP]               With preparations underway in North Korea for a massive military parade next week, speculation is mounting on whether the regime will unveil a new strategic weapon it has warned about in the past.             Oct. 10 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, on which the regime expects to hold festivities — including immense military parade maneuvers in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square — all amid the worst economic reality the country has experienced in almost three decades.             Satellite imagery published by 38 North, a North Korea analysis website, last month revealed thousands of troops gathered at Mirim Airport in Pyongyang on Aug. 31 presumably in preparation for the event.           More notably, 38 North noted the construction of makeshift shelters at parts for the facility that was presumably used to “protect and conceal heavy equipment that would be featured in the parade such as tanks, heavy artillery and transporter-erector-launchers (TELs).”           TELs are used to launch ballistic missiles into the air, and have been used in past parades to display the latest weapons in Pyongyang’s arsenal — like the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) featured in February 2018.           This year, amid a prolonged impasse in denuclearization negotiations with Washington, conjectures have been rife about a new weapons test from the regime that could shake up the situation in its favor ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s bid for reelection in November.             North Korean leader Kim Jong-un notably warned on Dec. 31 last year the world would soon witness a “new strategic weapon” capable of shifting the balance of power in the region, which experts have predicted could be a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM).           According to one government source in South Korea, however, those plans appeared to have been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which led North Korea to shut down its borders and reinforce domestic antiviral measures for fear of a mass outbreak that could cripple its outdated health care system.             “[The regime] could use the Workers’ Party Foundation Day ceremony to realize the strategic provocation it has put off for some time,” the source said.           Last month, the U.S.-based think tank Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) said satellite imagery from the North’s Sinpo South Shipyard, in South Hamgyong Province, suggested a forthcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 SLBM.           The primary indicator for a potential launch was the presence of several vessels within the secure boat basin, one of which was previously used to tow a submersible test stand barge out to sea, read a CSIS report.             The regime last tested the Pukguksong-3 on Oct. 2 last year, launching a missile that flew 450 kilometers (280 miles) into the East Sea at a peak altitude of 910 kilometers.           The weapon, if tipped with a nuclear warhead, combined with a new 3,000-ton submarine reportedly nearing launch, could give the North the ability to conduct a nuclear strike on the continental United States out at sea where it would be harder to detect.             But there have also been other theories of what the regime has in store for next week. According to the U.S. publication The National Interest last month, a senior White House official as well as multiple U.S. intelligence officials suspect Pyongyang will unveil a new solid-fuel ICBM at the parade.           Such a weapon would be a step up from the two ICBM models the regime currently possesses, the Hwasong-14 and 15, both of which run on liquid propellant and take a long time to fuel. A solid-propellant rocket on the other hand may be launched at a minute’s notice if properly maintained, giving the regime first-strike capabilities over its adversaries.             BY LEE CHUL-JAE, SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

36,"All eyes on Choi Ji-man as Ryu, Kim and Choo end seasons","

     Choi Ji-man of the Tampa Bay Rays is the only Korean major leaguer left in the 2020 playoffs after the inaugural Wild Card Series. [AP/YONHAP]               The 2020 postseason started strong for the MLB's Korean contingent, with three of the four players earning a spot in the playoffs, but only a few games later there's just one man left standing.           With Choi Ji-man's Tampa Bay Rays and Ryu Hyun-jin's Toronto Blue Jays facing each other in the inaugural Wild Card Series, at least one Korean player was guaranteed to make it through to the American League Division Series. In the end it was Choi, with the Rays sweeping the Blue Jays to end Ryu's 2020 season.           The Rays defeated the Blue Jays 3-1 in Game 1 and 8-2 in Game 2. Ryu was the starter in Game 2 with the unenviable task of trying to keep his team in the playoffs. Instead, he had his worst start of the season.              Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays, left, and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals, center, were eliminated in the Wild Card Series. Choo Shin-soo,right, and the Texas Rangers failed to make the postseason.                While the Blue Jays' postseason collapse was bad news for Ryu, it's great news for Rays' slugger Choi, now the only Korean left in the contention. Going into the playoffs it was unclear whether Choi would appear in the Wild Card Series as he's been out for a few weeks with a hamstring injury, but he did manage to make it into the batting box as a pinch hitter during Game 2.           Although he left the game with a .000 batting average, Choi's appearance suggests that he will be fit to play later in the postseason. Choi hasn’t done anything to make an impact to the Rays’ batting lineup yet, but he will be hoping to capitalize on his second straight appearance in the postseason.           Last year, the young Rays advanced to the postseason and Choi made appearances in six games. Throughout it, he had a .188 batting average with one home run and one RBI.           The Rays will now face the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series at Petco Park, in San Diego, California, starting on Monday, or Tuesday morning at 9:07 a.m., Korea time. The Division Series will be played in a best-of-five format.           While Choi still has time left to make improvements, Ryu's 2020 season is well and truly over. Despite a strong first season with the Blue Jays, Ryu's final trip to the mound slammed the door on the team's postseason journey with an 8-2 loss in Game 2.           Ryu left the mound after just one and two-thirds of an inning having given up eight hits and seven runs.           Ryu started off shaky, giving up a run in the first inning, but the real trouble came in the second. After giving up a hit to Ray’s center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, Ryu gave up a two-run homer to catcher Mike Zunino to allow the Rays to extend their lead.           With just one out, Ryu allowed designated hitter Randy Arozarena to hit a double, and at two outs, Ryu gave up a walk to third baseman Yandy Diaz. With two runners on base, Ryu was desperately looking for an inning-ending out, but a fielding error from Blue Jays' shortstop Bo Bichette allowed the Rays to load the bases.           That's when the unthinkable happened — Rays' right fielder Hunter Renfroe delivered with a clutch grand slam to give the Rays a 7-0 and end Ryu's night early.            Once Ryu left the game, the Blue Jays attempted to catch up with runs at the top of the third and fifth, but that was never going to be enough to cut into the deficit.           Of the seven runs, three counted as earned runs throughout Ryu’s short stint on the mound, leaving Ryu with a 16.20 ERA.          “I physically felt good, but I did notice my velocity dipped,” Ryu was quoted as saying on MLB.com, “especially my fastball. I think that the [location] mistakes hurt me more than the velocity itself. In that first inning, they were getting hits off of all my secondary pitches, which made the game extremely difficult for me.”           Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Blue Jays weren’t able to play a single game at their home stadium, Rogers Center, in Toronto. For this reason, they had to use Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, home stadium of the Blue Jays’ Triple-A team.           Despite the difficult conditions, Ryu complimented his team for making it to the postseason.           “I don’t want the past two games to taint all the efforts and hardships that we went through as a team during the regular season,” Ryu was quoted as saying. “We didn’t have a place to call home. Buffalo was a home stadium for us, but for all of us, it pretty much felt like being on the road throughout the season. I’m glad my teammates were able to go through it and to make the postseason was great.”           Following the Blue Jays’ quick exit, Ryu returned home to Korea on Friday. He will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine before he meets his family.           On the same day Ryu started, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Kim Kwang-hyun also made his start in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres. As both Ryu and Kim started on the same day, the morning of Chuseok in Korea, expectations were high but sadly that wasn’t to be.           While Ryu suffered a loss, the Cardinals started their Wilds Card Series with a win in Game 1 against the San Diego Padres, but it wasn't thanks to Kim's performance.          Making his first-ever postseason start in the major league, Kim also wasn’t able to fulfill the regulated innings to be eligible for a win as he was lifted from the mound after three and two-thirds of an inning.           Kim gave up three runs off two walks and five hits before being pulled from the mound.           As the Cardinals got off to a strong start by scoring four runs in the first inning, Kim headed onto the mound with plenty of run support. Although Kim never gave up that lead, he did give up a run in every inning.           Thanks to the Cardinals’ strong batting lineup, by the time Kim was pulled off the mound the team had a comfortable 6-3 lead.           With Kim out the game, the Cardinals allowed the Padres another run to finish the game 7-4, winning Game 1.           Although Kim had a no decision, this was his worst start of the season as he gave up three runs and five hits, while striking out two with a 7.36 ERA.           As the Cardinals picked up a win in Game 1, there were expectations that the club might advance to the National League Division Series, but losses in Game 2 at 11-9 and Game 3 at 4-0 ended their postseason campaign.            The Cardinals may have failed to advance, but Kim ends his rookie season in the major league having played as a closer and a starter, appearing in both the regular season and the playoffs.           The Padres, who defeated the Cardinals in the Wild Card Series, will now compete in the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.          The Padres will start Game 1 against the Dodgers at Globe Life Field in Texas on Monday, local time, or Tuesday morning, Korea time.           The fourth Korean MLB player, Choo Shin-soo of the Texas Rangers, ended his season earlier as the Rangers failed to earn a postseason spot this year.            As the oldest and most experienced Korean major leaguer, Choo may well have had his last at bat in the majors, as the veteran finished a seven-year contract with the Rangers this season and has now earned his free agent status.          Suffering from injury this season, Choo finished with a .236 batting average with five home runs and 15 RBIs. Despite his injury, Choo was able to make a last appearance in the Rangers’ final regular season game against the Houston Astros, appearing as lead-off batter and getting on base before being taken out for a pinch runner.           It's still unclear whether 38-year-old Choo will have a chance to continue with the Rangers or pick up a contract with any other club. After 15 years in the majors, the All-Star has a career batting average at 0.275 with 218 home runs and 782 RBIs.          BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]         "

I didn’t know a word of French but that didn’t stop them from communicating with me about the combat plans.”           Park was one of about 150 Koreans assigned to the French Battalion during the Korean War (1950-1953).

[PARK MOON-JOON]               “I was 20 years old at the time when I heard about the call from the French Battalion for any men who had graduated high school who wanted to serve with them,” Park said. “I signed up. It was then Feb. 10 of 1951. I was with the French Battalion until the armistice was signed in July 1953.”           By the time the Korean War broke out, it had been at least a century-old practice amongst the French to incorporate foreign soldiers.           “The Koreans were not auxiliaries — on the contrary, they were considered as brothers in arms,” said Philippe Lefort, ambassador of France to Korea, speaking during an interview at his residence in central Seoul on Sept. 22. “They formed the Korean section within the [French] Battalion. It is a peculiarity of the history of this battalion, which comes straight from the French tradition of the Foreign Legion and the marine troops, used to incorporate foreign soldiers.”              A group of French and Korean soldiers of the French Battalion in Gapyeong County, Gyeonggi, in November 1951.

[ECPAD/GABRIEL APPAY]         Just a month after the outbreak of the war, France, one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, sent a warship, the Aviso “La Grandière,” which took part in the Incheon landing in September 1950. They were followed by the arrival of the French battalion in Busan in November.           The battalion consisted of 3,421 soldiers according to the French Embassy in Seoul. Mostly volunteers, many of them had experience in conflicts abroad.           “France was already involved in the Indochina war, and the Algerian war was about to emerge,” said Lefort. “Despite this difficult environment, the French authorities deemed it necessary to support the United Nations Command and the peace in the Korean Peninsula, and made the decision to engage militarily. […] The needs of the Indochina war — our resources were almost exclusively devoted to it — led to the decision to set up a battalion of volunteers especially for this conflict.”           The French Battalion arrived in Korea against the backdrop of Chinese intervention in the war. They quickly distinguished themselves with the famous bayonet charge at the Battle of Wonju in January 1951, winning recognition from the American soldiers and UN forces commander General Matthew Ridgway.             By February 1951, the French were dispatched to the Jipyeong-ri area of Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi, where they were to engage the Chinese while Ridgway worked on building a stronger defense line in Wonju. Seoul had been captured by North Korean and Chinese forces in January 1951, and the UN forces were under mounting pressure.              Soldiers in the Jipyeong-ri area of Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi, in February 1951.

It was either you were going to walk away alive, or your enemy would. It left us with no choice but to kill first and to kill fast.”           The battle continued from Feb. 13 to 16 in 1951.           “In the freezing winter of February 1951, French soldiers, alongside the Americans, withstood three days of intense raids by Chinese troops, the equivalent of four divisions, before delivering a fatal blow with strikes supported by the Air Force,” said Ambassador Lefort. “We must not forget that the French soldiers, at that time, were the last bulwark against the Chinese, who came to help the North Korean people. The balance of power was 10 to one in favor of the Chinese.”           The French did not give in. With the arrival of American backup on the ground and in the air by Feb. 15, the UN forces emerged victorious. The French battalion was awarded their second Presidential Unit Citation by the United States after the battle.

[ECPAD/RAYMOND BENARD]         In March, the French Battalion was dispatched to Hill 1037, located close to Seoul, then to the battles at Mount Udu in Gangwon in April. They were sent to the Putchaetul battle in Hongcheon County, Gangwon, in May, before fighting their most pitched battles yet, including the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge in September, in which some 1,900 UN soldiers died, according to the military records of France. In October 1952, they were dispatched to the Battle of Arrowhead Ridge in Cheorwon County of Gangwon.             “The worst memory [that my father recalled] was the uninterrupted artillery bombardments for 24 hours during the Battle of Arrowhead,” Roger Quintard, son of Sergeant Robert Quintard, wrote in a Sept. 13 email. “[He said] it made an infernal noise and [they] wondered when it would end. During this time it was estimated that 20,000 artillery shells had fallen on the French position. Most surprising was the silence that followed the bombardment: almost as deafening.”           Sgt. Quintard served in the war from Dec. 26, 1951, to Dec. 5, 1952. Like many in the battalion, he was a career soldier who had experience in the Indochina wars. He died in 1995.

There were a lot more familiar faces when they came to visit Korea in 2002. I saw my commanding officer and the liaison officer that I had known well during the war. With one look from afar, I knew it was them.”           A member of the French force who is well-remembered — even by the Korean public — is General Monclar.             “His real name is Raoul Charles Magrin-Vernerey, but in the French Forces, he was better known under the name of Monclar, a nickname for the resistance, used during the Second World War,” said Lefort. “In the early stages of the outbreak of the Korean War, General Monclar persuaded the deputy minister of defense to engage troops in Korea. He decided to bring himself in the war, but his rank was too high for commanding the battalion. So he accepted to lower his rank to lieutenant colonel, the only way to participate in the Korean War and to lead the French battalion on the battlefield.”              General Monclar, right, with Major-General Edward Almond of the United States, at Jipyeong-ri in February 1951.

Seven soldiers’ remains were never recovered, but that statistic may be about to change.           In June last year, the Korean Ministry of National Defense Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification (Makri) found the remains of a soldier at the site of the Arrowhead Ridge.           “We have good reasons to believe, based on the articles found along with the remains, that the remains belong either to a French or an American soldier,” Korea’s Ministry of National Defense said in its statement in June 2019.           Families in France have been contacted and the authorities are in the process of matching DNA samples, said Ambassador Lefort.              Korean veterans of the war who served in the French Battalion, Park Moon-joon, fourth from left, and Park Dong-ha, sixth from left, with Ambassador Lefort, seventh from left, and members of the Saint-Cyr Military Academy of France, at a commemoration at the War Memorial of Korea in central Seoul in November 2019. [EMBASSY OF FRANCE IN KOREA]         Lefort, who began his tenure in Korea in September last year, has had opportunities to connect with several veterans of the war. One of them is Hwang Kyu-baik, the world-famous artist known for his unique mezzotint technique. He was not part of the French Battalion, but France was his first footing as a budding artist following the war.           “Meeting veterans is each time a deeply moving experience,” said the French ambassador. “Hwang shared with me memories of the war that he had never been able to share with his own family. By the time he was done telling his story, he had tears in his eyes, and so had I.”           The French diplomatic residence coincidentally holds Hwang's very first printmaking work, dated to 1968, and his most recent engraving work. Hwang gifted his piece “South North Korean Summit” to Lefort during their recent meeting in June.           “I can no longer meet every single French veteran of the Korean War to thank them, but I can at least show my gratitude to one French person,” Hwang said in a recorded interview with his staff members prior to meeting with Lefort.           “I came across several foreign soldiers during my service in the Korean War,” Hwang told the Korea JoongAng Daily in a Sept. 29 phone interview. “In one instance, against the booming sounds of the shells in the distance, I heard a young man crying. It was a young soldier. He spoke English, but I wasn’t sure where he was from. I asked him, ‘How could you come all the way here to risk your life for a country not your own?’ He said, ‘It is the will of my country to defend Korea.'”           In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the war this year, the French Embassy in Seoul plans to join a ministerial summit with participating nations of the war in November organized by the Korean government. It will also host a photo exhibition at the end of November to commemorate the day the French Battalion arrived in Korea. A collection of photos of the battalion in Korea will be exhibited at Art Space in Busan from Nov. 28 to Dec. 13.           “In Paris, a ‘Wall of Names’ dedicated to the veterans will be inaugurated on Oct. 13, near the Korean War Memorial, an emblematic place where the Korean Embassy and veterans meet every year to commemorate the date of June 25,” Lefort said.             Also on Oct. 13 in Korea, the ambassador and his staff will be joining an annual event to honor one of the fallen, who, to his last breath, spoke of the Korean people.           “On May 8, 1951, after treating some Korean civilians in a nearby village, Military Doctor Major Jules Jean-Louis was on his way back to the French camp when he came across two soldiers of the 5th South Korean Division injured by a landmine,” Lefort said.              Major Jules Jean-Louis. [JEAN-FRANCOIS PELLETIER]         The doctor called for help to the American forces nearby. Fearing the two soldiers would die from hemorrhage, Jean-Louis decided to approach the two himself, but triggered a second landmine which exploded as he approached.           “He was also wounded,” Lefort said. “He succumbed soon after. His last words were: ‘Take care of the two wounded Koreans.’”           A statue of the doctor stands near the site to this day, in Hongcheon.           Every year on May 8, an official ceremony is held in his honor by the county office.           “France is always invited to participate,” Lefort said. “This year, due to Covid-19, the ceremony has been postponed to Oct. 13.

[YONHAP]               Koreans in their 20s and 30s have taken out a total of 62 trillion won ($53 billion) in so-called minus bankbook loans in the three years of the Moon Jae-in administration, indicating that young people are seeking alternative ways to raise money for real estate and stock investment as traditional bank loans have become more restrictive.             Minus bankbook loans are a short-term debt offset against an existing parent account, operating similarly to a prearranged overdraft.          According to the office of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) lawmaker Kim Sang-hoon, based on data provided by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), 1.23 million minus bankbook loans were opened by people in their 20s and 30s at five commercial banks between 2017 and July 2019. That accounts for 36.5 percent of the 3.37 million minus bankbook loans created overall during the same period.             In 2017, minus bankbook loans taken out by people in their 20s and 30s amounted to 15.87 trillion won.

As of July this year, it has already reached 14.2 trillion won.           The lawmaker’s office particularly noted the sharp rise of such loans among people in their 20s.             Newly opened minus bankbook loans by people in their 20s have risen to 82,538 as of last year, up from 66,936 in 2017.             The maximum amount that could be withdrawn from minus bankbook accounts has risen from 2.26 trillion won in 2017 to 2.63 trillion won as of 2019.            Overdue payments by those in their 20s have also significantly increased.             Overdue payments of minus bankbook loans by those in their 20s in 2017 amounted to 1.27 billion won. By the end of 2019, that figure had risen to 1.69 billion won. As of the first seven months of this year, 1.3 billion won is still owed.           “Amid the loan restrictions applied under the Moon Jae-in government, young people have been aggressively seeking out loans as housing prices continue to rise while they also struggle from jobs,” said lawmaker Kim. “They are also borrowing loans to invest in the stock market.”           Kim said the younger generation will undoubtedly face a larger debt burden, especially compared to older age groups as they have relatively smaller assets and income if the current sluggish economy continues.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
41,"Between his TV and theater roles, Joo Won's feeling like Jekyll and Hyde","

     Joo Won stars once again in the upcoming musical ""Ghost,"" which kicks off at the D-Cube Arts Center from Oct. 6. [SEENSEE COMPANY]               On TV, actor Joo Won plays a charismatic but apathetic detective on the most popular primetime weekend drama series “Alice.""            On stage, he turns into a soulful “Ghost,” trying everything he can do to express his love and protect his girlfriend Molly.             Going back and forth between two different mediums — broadcast television and live theater — is a challenge for any actor, but portraying two completely opposite characters at the same time takes the challenge to a whole new level.           “Only those actors who are serious about live theater can pull that off,” says a publicist from Seensee, the Korean production company of the musical “Ghost,” explaining why it decided to cast Joo Won to play Sam, the male protagonist in the show.           After getting discharged from the military last February, Joo Won had been taking time off, from both on stage and on screen, until he appeared in the drama series “Alice” late last month.           Then things got busier for the actor when rehearsals for “Ghost,” which kicks off at the D-Cube Arts Center in western Seoul, on Oct. 6, began in earnest.           Joo Won says he feels like Jekyll and Hyde these days, trying to shift between two contrasting characters.           Based on the 1990 hit film of the same name starring Demi Moore as Molly and Patrick Swayze as Sam, the musical “Ghost,” with screenplay and lyrics by Bruce Joel Rubin and music and lyrics by Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard, premiered in 2011 in England and the Korean production landed in Seoul in 2013.           The film was such a box office hit here that middle-aged Koreans, who remember getting pixie haircuts to look like Molly and signed up for pottery classes back in the 90s, rushed to the theater to watch the musical version of their all-time favorite movie.           The musical wrapped up to resounding success, leading Joo Won, who played Sam back then as well, to also want to be a part of “Ghost” when it returned.           “I was in the military when I heard about ‘Ghost’ coming back,” said Joo Won in a recent Zoom interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. “Then I remembered making promises to the fellow actors seven years ago that we should perform together again when it comes back. The chemistry among us was so great we wanted to do it again.”           Actors Kim Woo-hyung, who alternates the role of Sam with Joo Won; Ivy and Park Ji-yeon playing Molly; and Choi Jeong-won playing Oda Mae Brown kept their promises and returned to perform together.           The plot of the musical truthfully follows the film. It centers on lovers Sam and Molly. When Sam dies, he becomes caught between the real world and the next one. As Molly is in danger, Sam can’t leave her, and a medium, Oda Mae Brown, helps Sam to get in touch with Molly to warn her.           Although the musical tells the classic storyline basically using the same lead cast as seven years ago, Joo Won is convinced that those who have watched the show seven years ago will actually enjoy it more.                Choi Jeong-won, left, playing Oda Mae Brown, Joo Won, center, playing Sam, and Ivy, right, playing Molly, all performed for the premier of the musical in 2013. [SEENSEE COMPANY]               “It was amazing to see how much everyone has developed over the years,” he said, “in terms of their prowess on stage I mean. They were already such great musical actors back then, but seeing them performing the same thing seven years later, I just couldn’t believe it. They were on a whole new level. Every rehearsal, I feel so grateful that I can perform with them.”           Although Joo Won, who made his debut as a musical actor in 2006, didn't perform on stage during the seven years, he said he is making “all possible efforts to show a new Sam.”           “I think I had too many thoughts back then, and wasn't so sure about how to really express that aching love of not being able to touch or talk to a lover anymore. But I feel a lot more comfortable now, and I’m trying out different emotions,” said the actor, as though he’s learned a lot about love over the past seven years.             “I guess Sam who is seven years older, has become more mature, and more aware of what is going on [with his feelings],” he said. “When I rehearse, I’m surprised to see myself enjoying it so much. I’m less strained and I’m pretty sure that the audience can feel that.”           Although Joo Won made a debut as a musical actor, he’s been gaining more fame with the roles he played in drama series and films. However, the passionate actor says he doesn’t want to let go of the thrill he feels on stage.           “I have great pride in being a live theater actor, who made a debut on stage,” he said. “Although I often appear on TV and in films, I am still a theater actor who can juggle both. Senior actors in fact acknowledge me a lot for it and encourage me to do both and do them well.”           In fact, singers and actors have been crossing into other genres more often in recent years — a phenomenon that continues to create arguments for and against.           Popular idol stars with ticket power performing as lead cast members in musicals has been particularly evident; however, problems have also been rising as busy stars find it difficult to match let alone make time for rehearsals with other cast members.           “Preparing for musicals is quite different to shooting a drama for a film, especially if you are a lead character,” said Joo Won.           “Usually for dramas and movies, the shooting doesn’t go on chronologically and the director shoots certain scenes all together in one day, for example, and the only people that have to show up on site can just be you or your partner. But for musical rehearsals, oftentimes, especially when opening date approaches, dozens of cast including the ensemble all get together to run it through from start to the end. And it doesn’t make sense if you can’t make it.”           “In that sense, we love working with Joo Won and decided to work again with him because he empties his calendar when we have ‘Ghost' rehearsals even though he’s very busy with shooting ‘Alice,’” said the publicist from Seensee. “It’s usually not that easy for popular actors, but Joo Won takes it seriously.”           Joo Won has performed in a handful of musicals since his debut, but “Ghost” will be the only musical that he’s performing twice. He said the musical is so attractive that he’ll do it again when there’s a third chance.             “It’s literally so magical,” he said. “There are a lot of illusions involved in the show as Sam is a ghost and it has to be well presented on stage. It’s amazing how the illusionist and the director made it possible for me to walk through the door and look like a ghost.”              Joo Won looks like he's walking through a door. [SEENSEE COMPANY]               Since the original film uses a lot of special effects, it was a challenge for the musical production team. But illusionist Paul Kieve, who worked on the Harry Potter films, made it possible.           “Such magical moments beautifully portrayed on stage on top of a great classic story will be what makes this musical a true show,” said Joo Won.           BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]           “Ghost” kicks off at the D-Cube Arts Center in Sindorim, western Seoul from Oct. 6 to March 14, 2021. Tickets range from 60,000 won ($51) to 140,000 won. It starts at 8 p.m. on weekdays and at 2 p.m. and at 6:30 p.m. on weekends. There are no shows on Mondays.   "
42,[New Release] Joan Osborne,"

                 Joan Osborne    “Trouble and Strife”      Label: Thirty Tigers    Genre: Rock/Pop      Joan Osborne’s many fans never know where her versatile voice might land, and on “Trouble and Strife” it’s between two guitars, one in each stereo channel.           The album might be the closest approximation to “Relish” that Osborne has recorded since her release of that breakthrough album 25 years ago.           Guitarists Jack Petruzzelli, Nels Cline and Andrew Carillo provide a handsome framework with their solos, fills and rhythmic riffs as Osborne makes a variety of retro pop styles sound fresh.           She honors Dylan on the title cut and Prince on “Meat and Potatoes,” imitating the inimitable with gusto and good humor that lift both songs above mere mimicry. Osborne also draws from gospel, country and classic rock, her distinctive alto as sultry and sonorous as ever.           She opts for topical topics on her first album of original material since 2014, singing about the gender gap, the power of diversity and the need to keep dancing and romancing.            On the bluesy “Hands Off,” Osborne rails against corruption and sounds eager to vote, the song offered as the soundtrack for a better tomorrow.           AP   "

        Ran Blake and Frank Carlberg      “Gray Moon”      Label: Red Piano Records    Genre: Jazz          On “Gray Moon,” Ran Blake and Frank Carlberg tickle the ol’ 176, conducting a compelling keyboard conversation in the language of jazz.          With two pianos and no accompaniment, Blake and Carlberg explore a wide variety of compositions, from Ellington-Strayhorn standards to obscure Hollywood film fare and dissonant music from Greece and Catalonia.           The result sounds like a mix of Otis Spann, Charles Ives, James Booker, George Gershwin and Thelonious Monk, times two. Ferrante and Teicher it ain’t.           The 16 tunes were recorded in a single afternoon in Boston’s Jordan Hall, creating the vibe of a Sunday recital, and the way Blake (in the right channel) and Carlberg (left channel) complement each other is fascinating. They can swing, but the tempos tend toward slow and the volume is often pianissimo, no pun intended.           There are moments of minimalism, including occasions when Blake and Carlberg are each playing only one note at a time. Even with two pianos, silence is an important element in their captivating sound.           AP   "

                 SuperM    “Super One”    Label: SM Entertainment/Capitol Records    Genre: K-pop          The K-pop group SuperM go big on their first studio album “Super One,” with familiar rhythms but also bold choices.           The newest septet on the block leans heavily on SM Entertainment’s tried and tested manual of success, but with more English in the mix.           While sub-groups are nothing new in K-pop, this supergroup’s talent is nothing to be trifled with, its members hailing from Exo, SHINee, NCT 127 and WayV. The new album is a power music map to the nearest dance floor, with 15 addictive tracks to keep one busy till dawn.           Their most obvious influence in terms of sound is Exo’s electric, cinematic pop (a genre unto itself really).            The singles “Tiger Inside” and “100” bring some of that unsettling energy to the fore. “Tiger Inside” has a distorted bass and tubular effects that try to emulate the sound of a roar, while “100” — produced by band member Mark — sounds like Optimus Prime found himself in some hot action.           “One (Monster & Infinity)” mixes pugnacious R&B, trumpets and trap. “Line ’Em Up” finds its Middle Eastern groove with a happy flute. And “Together at Home” rocks with a retro ’90s bass.           The few slow songs on the record don’t drag things down: “So Long” is sensual, “Better Days” is an earnest piano ballad and “Wish You Were Here” has a mellow reggae flow.           Simply put, SuperM is super on “Super One.”           AP   "
45,[TEST DRIVE] Mercedes looks to make inroads in SUV market with 2 new models,"

     Mercedes-Benz's GLB, left, and GLA SUVs on the road. [MERCEDES-BENZ KOREA]               Everybody knows Mercedes-Benz has strong presence in Korea’s sedan market — particularly in its best-selling E-Class.           The premium German carmaker is vying for a similar level of dominance in the SUV market, with two recently launched models for Korean customers: The fully revamped GLA and the debuting GLB.           The GLA and GLB, categorized as compact SUVs, share the same platform and powertrain, making them siblings.             But they also differ drastically, both on the inside and out.             The Korea JoongAng Daily recently got a chance to compare the two SUVs, driving a 140-kilometer (87-mile) round trip to a cafe in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi.           First came the GLB 250 4MATIC. It was intriguing from first sight, as it looked nothing like Mercedes' other SUV lineup, known for having a fluid and more elegant line.           Instead, the GLB SUV was rather chunky, giving it a boxier and more angular demeanor.           As a fan of the car company’s sophisticated, flowy design language, this GLB SUV's exterior didn’t appeal to me as other models.           Taking a look at its interior, however, showed that this car's aesthetics were not at its foremost for its designers.           Despite it being a compact SUV, the GLB provided ample space in both the front and back rows, making it an adequate option for families.            Its wheelbase is 2,830 millimeters (111 inches), approximately 100 millimeters longer than the GLA's 2,729 millimeters, and falling just shy of that of the GLC in the company's larger lineup, at 2,875 millimeters. With the second row folded, this SUV has a luggage capacity of 1,805 liters (477 gallons).           Mercedes-Benz Korea said the seven-seater version will launch next year and will bolster its creds as family-friendly vehicle.           Once on the road, its handling wasn’t as smooth as expected. After all, it was a compact SUV, and the expectation was that it should be agile and quick. On an urban road, the vehicle's first impression left me with the hefty, rough feeling of driving an off-road-oriented SUV.           It wasn't until reaching the empty highway that this boxy SUV finally showed off its strong points. At high speeds, the vehicle was extremely stable, although noise from the ground and wind was easily audible. On winding or bumpy roads it felt like the vehicle was firmly gripping to the surface.           The carmaker said the GLB 250 4MATIC comes with an Off-Road Engineering Package that offers stronger control and additional information on the center display, such as the degree of the slope and the condition of the suspension. The test drive course did not include off-road routes, so I didn’t get to try this mode out. But this package seems to lack the endurance for the toughness of unpaved roads.           Its smaller sibling, the GLA 250 4MATIC, has actually been with Korean customers longer, as the company launched its previous version here last year.           It inherits the curving, elegant line of Mercedes-Benz’ SUV family but its swooping roofline and driving performance hews closer to a coupe-like demeanor.           The GLA provided a drastically sportier performance. The steering wheel was much smaller and the handling, therefore, was more responsive.           Its acceleration was quick and its handling was light — both of which were maintained at high speeds as well. The vehicle did, however, rock slightly when travelling in excess of 120 kilometers per hour.           Its backseat would feel a little cramped for some, but what was noticeable was the affluent headroom secured as the latest fully revamped version has gotten 110 millimeters taller.           The GLA 250 4MATIC’s price starts at 59.1 million won ($50,600). The GLB 250 4MATIC’s price starts at 61.1 million won.           The target customers were clearly different for the two SUVs. The GLB SUV is a more practical option for those who have more family members or friends to carry around. The GLA was more of a stylish option for those who will travel shorter distances and want to have some fun inside the city.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Girl group Blackpink poses for photos for the online press conference held on Friday afternoon after the release of its first full-length album. [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               Sometimes it’s better to keep expectations low. But not when it comes to Blackpink — the band’s newest album is guaranteed to beat anyone’s expectations, however high they may be.           “We put our heart and soul into the album,” said member Jennie during an online press conference held on Friday afternoon, an hour after the band’s first full-length album titled “The Album” was released at 1 p.m.           “This is our first new album in such a long time and we felt that a lot of people were waiting for us. We wanted to show everyone the best we could, especially because this is our first full-length album. So we took part in writing the music, all out of our wish to pay back the love we got.”           “The Album” is Blackpink’s first-ever, full-length album, which strikes as a surprise to K-pop fans, considering the band has stormed global music charts with just singles and EPs until now.              The official image for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls,"" the lead track of the group's first full-length album titled ""The Album."" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]                Anticipation for the album had soared ever since the band’s agency YG Entertainment first shared the news of its drop earlier this year in spring, and the countdown began when the release date was set for today in July.           Preorders for “The Album” surpassed one million copies as of Friday, the highest number for any K-pop girl group so far. The 18,888 copies of the limited edition LP have also sold out, and the numbers are expected to go up even more until the day that sales for the hard copies go on sale on Oct. 6, according to the agency. There are eight tracks on the album, including the singles that were released earlier this summer: “How You Like That” and “Ice Cream.”            “We’ve released a variety of music so far, but having the first full-length album is very meaningful in itself I think,” said Rose. “We were so excited when we first found out that we’ll be releasing it. We thought the songs that could go on the album and spent all our time in the studio. Some songs were taken out at the end, but I think the album is filled with a variety of genres such as hip-hop, R&B and dance that will be enough to let listeners have a good time.”              Images from the music video for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls"" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]       Images from the music video for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls"" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               The lead track “Lovesick Girls” marks a first-time venture into a new genre of country folk that Blackpink has never set foot in before, but sees the group maintain its iconic style, poise and flair. The song comes to an exhilarating apex in the refrain when the quartet sings its lines along with a backup chorus of voices, which was a style of music the band had shown beforehand with “Kill This Love” (2019), but with a more accomplished sound this time.           ""Lovesick Girls"" currently sits at No. 3 on Spotify's Global Top 50 chart as of Sunday, while ""Bet You Wanna,"" ""Pretty Savage"" and ""Ice Cream"" sit at the No. 4, 8 and 10 spots on the same chart. The music video for ""Lovesick Girls"" surpassed 10 million views within just an hour of release, nearing the 100 million view mark as of Sunday afternoon. The video has also topped YouTube's list of most-watched videos in 24 hours, and the band's official YouTube channel saw 800,000 new subscribers to near a total of 50 million.            “We were younger girls when we first debuted [in 2016], but now we’ve grown,” said Jennie. “We have in ourselves the urge to run around free, and I think we got that across in the music video. I hope that after listening to the chorus, people would want to sing along and dance with us.”           The members of Blackpink took part in the writing process of the songs on “The Album” like never before. Members Jennie and Jisoo contributed to writing the lyrics of “Lovesick Girls” and Jennie helped with writing the music along with producers Teddy, 24, Brian Lee, Leah Haywood, R.Tee and David Guetta.              The official image for Blackpink's ""Lovesick Girls,"" the lead track of the group's first full-length album titled ""The Album.""

We all fall once, whether because of love or because of something else. But we find something to go on for and then we try again. That’s a story that we repeat in our lives, but it isn’t a sad song. It’s a song that carries a positive message that tells everyone to have hope.”           While the unexpected outbreak of the coronavirus may have kept the band from meeting fans in person, it hasn’t stopped them from collaborating with some of the world’s biggest music stars, like Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez and Cardi B. Blackpink was featured on Lady Gaga’s album released in May through the track “Sour Candy,” while Gomez lent her voice to the band’s single “Ice Cream,” which has been included as a track in “The Album.” Rapper Cardi B has been featured on track No. 4 of ""The Album,"" titled “Bet You Wanna.”           “We grew up listening to their songs, so it’s just such an honor to be able to collaborate with them,” said Lisa.           Jennie added, “I feel like going back to when we were trainees and we were listening to their songs. It’s just so inspirational to be able to work together with them.

It was the fastest time for any K-pop act's music video to hit the 500 million-view mark, and also beat the group's own record of 111 days it had set with ""Kill This Love"" (2019) by almost 40 days. The band also surpassed DJ Marshmello to become the artist with the second-largest number of YouTube subscribers in the world.           “We’re honored to have that nickname,” said Rose. “We’re grateful that we get to accomplish everything with our music. We’re so happy that people related to our music in different ways, not just simply listening to them.”           After the coronavirus subsides, the first thing on the members’ minds is getting on stage to meet with Blink, the official fan club, all over the world. But even before that, they have a variety of new content waiting for fans, such as the first-ever Netflix documentary program “Blackpink: Light Up The Sky,” set to be released on Oct. 14.           “It’s sad to go on stage without Blink,” said Lisa. “When everything gets safer, the first thing we want to do is tour. We miss Blink so much — especially outside of Korea. But we have something in store for Blink, so I hope you all look forward to that.”           BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
47,Retail investors rally against plan to increase taxes,"

     A screen shows the closing figure for the Kospi in a trading room at Hana Bank in Jung District, central Seoul, on Sept. 22. [YONHAP]                With the government planning to increase taxes on retail investors, Koreans are scrambling to offload their stocks in a bid to evade the new charges.           Under the revised enforcement ordinances of Korea's Income Tax Act, which is set to come into effect in April 2021, the government will collect taxes from individuals who own more than 300 million won ($256,000) in stocks of a single entity, or over 1 percent of the total shares. The tax will be set between 22 percent and 27.5 percent of gains on transfers, depending on the size of profits.            Until recently, only people who own 1 billion won of a single stock were obliged to pay the taxes, as they are categorized as a major shareholder. The government plans to add more retail investors to the category.            Regarding the sudden increase in taxes, retail investors are expressing frustration. Some are already selling off their shares to avoid the extra charge.           “When the average selling price of an apartment is Seoul is at about 1 billion won, how can a person who owns only 300 million won in shares be considered a ‘major shareholder?’” Lee Moon-sook, a 51-year-old retail investor, said. “I guess it’s time to sell off all my shares.”           The Korea Stockholders Alliance held a press conference in front of the government complex in Sejong on Sept. 25, voicing its opposition to the revision.           “[If the country’s revised law goes into effect,] many retail investors will have to suffer from a sharp decline in stock prices as more people sell their shares,” said a spokesperson from the alliance during the conference.           A Blue House petition gained over 95,000 signatures as of Sept. 27, expressing strong opposition to the law.           In a response, Rep. Kim Byung-wook of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) said in a Facebook post on Sunday that he will surely do something to “delay the enforcement decree.""           Kim also said the country should approach the issue from two major perspectives, emphasizing that “we should think about how we can move the money that is currently tied up in real estate to the stock market, as well as how we can overcome the so-called Korea discount.”             However, the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee has not indicated any plan to revise the law. According to a source from the DP, the party has not discussed postponing the law with the committee.             Experts say that the Ministry of Economy and Finance is not likely to revise the policy at this time when the country’s financial situation is getting worse due to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic as the law is a good chance to collect more taxes which will eventually help the economy.           “The Ministry of Economy and Finance is following the basic principle that ‘taxation must occur where income occurs’,” a source from the DP said. “However, the Financial Services Commission worries about the future of [the stock market] which will see a sharp decline [due to the revised law].”           BY CHEA SARAH, SHIM SAE-ROM AND IM JANG-HYUK   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

Following wins in both of their last games in the regular season, expectations were high.           The Blue Jays were first to start Game 2 of the Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field in Florida on Wednesday, local time, or 5 a.m. in Korea. As the Blue Jays lost Game 1 3-1 to the Rays, Ryu took to the mound as the last chance for his team to stay in the postseason.           Despite a strong first season with the Blue Jays, Ryu wasn't able to manage this one last trick and the young team ended their postseason journey with an 8-2 loss in Game 2.            Ryu had his worst start yet in a Blue Jays uniform, leaving the mound after just one and two-thirds of an inning having given up eight hits and seven runs.           Ryu started off shaky, giving up a run in the first inning, but the real trouble came in the second. After giving up a hit to Ray’s center fielder Kevin Kiermaier, Ryu gave up a two-run homer to catcher Mike Zunino to allow the Rays to extend their lead.           With just one out, Ryu allowed designated hitter Randy Arozarena to hit a double, and at two outs, Ryu gave up a walk to third baseman Yandy Díaz. With two runners on base, Ryu was desperately looking for an inning-ending out, but a fielding error from Blue Jays' shortstop Bo Bichette allowed the Rays to load the bases.           That's when the unthinkable happened — Rays' right fielder Hunter Renfroe delivered with a clutch grand slam to give the Rays a 7-0 and end Ryu's night early.            Once Ryu left the game, the Blue Jays attempted to catch up with runs at the top of the third and fifth, but that was never going to be enough to cut into the deficit.           The Blue Jays had advanced to the postseason for the first time in four years this year, but that journey will end after being swept out of the Wild Card Series.           Of the seven runs, three counted as earned runs throughout Ryu’s short stint on the mound in Game 2. This was by far the worst start for Ryu this year as he picked up a loss and had a 16.20 ERA.           While the Blue Jays postseason collapse was bad news for Ryu, it's great news for one of the only other Koreans in the MLB playoffs — Rays' slugger Choi Ji-man. It was unclear whether Choi would appear in the Wild Card Series as he's been out for a few weeks with a hamstring injury, but he did manage to make it into the batting box as a pinch hitter.            Although he left the game with a .000 batting average, Choi's appearance suggests that he will be fit to play later in the postseason.           While Ryu suffered a loss and the Blue Jays are headed home, the Cardinals started their Wilds Card Series with a win in Game 1 against the San Diego Padres.           Although the Cardinals picked up a win, Kim’s start was also a disappointment.           Making his first-ever postseason start in the major league, Kim also wasn’t able to fulfill the regulated innings to be eligible for a win as he was lifted from the mound after three and two-thirds of an inning.           Kim gave up three runs off two walks and five hits before being pulled from the mound.           As the Cardinals got off to a strong start by scoring four runs in the first inning, Kim headed onto the mound with plenty of run support. Although Kim never gave up that lead, he did give up a run in every inning.           Thanks to the Cardinals’ strong batting lineup, by the time Kim was pulled off the mound the team had a comfortable 6-3 lead.           With Kim out the game, the Cardinals allowed the Padres another run to finish the game 7-4, winning Game 1.           Although Kim had a no decision, this was his worst start of the season as he gave up three runs and five hits, while striking out two with a 7.36 ERA.           With the Cardinals taking a 1-0 lead in the Wild Card Series, they’ll continue the series in Game 2 on Thursday, local time, or Friday at 6:08 a.m. in Korea, at Petco Park in San Diego.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
49,Buffet restaurants adapt to pandemic by nixing the buffets,"

     A poster introducing a new service by CJ Foodville’s Season’s Table. [CJ FOODVILLE]                With their popularity in a free fall amid the pandemic, buffet restaurants are now trying to claw their way back to profitability by abandoning buffets.           The companies are increasingly shifting to standard restaurant formats or focusing on takeout and delivery orders to keep themselves afloat.           CJ Foodville’s Season’s Table abandoned its buffet completely and started serving food instead. Instead of the variety of foods that buffets usually offer, consumers can choose from one out of its eight menus that can be ordered through a QR code. The company started test-operating the service on Tuesday at its four branches.           “We introduced this service considering the safety of customers’ eating-out culture,” a spokesperson for CJ Foodville said. “We will continuously try to come up with a new eating culture.”           Elandeats’ premium buffet chain Ashley is still offering a variety of dishes in unlimited quantities, but isn't allowing customers to serve themselves. Patrons instead choose what they want at their tables, and employees immediately serve them. Ashley has been operating this service since Sept. 25.             Seafood buffet Viking’s Wharf also changed its system to make their employees to serve its unlimited food to customers.           Hotels are also following the trend. Lotte Hotel Seoul has been running a “Private Gourmet” service in its buffet restaurant La Seine since Sept. 18. Customers can choose up to 70 food items in advance and employees serve them unlimited quantities. The hotel reduced its available seats by 40 percent amid the pandemic.           “We introduced a new service so that customers to La Seine can enjoy eating safely while following the government’s social distancing guidelines,” said a spokesperson for Lotte Hotel Seoul.           The Parkview, The Hotel Shilla’s buffet restaurant, is no longer a buffet anymore. Instead, they offer a full course meal consisting of the restaurant’s signature menus, including crabs and lamb chops.              A banner explains Ashley’s new ’Ashely Home Dining“ service that allows customers to order food through the delivery app Baedal Minjok. [ELANDEATS]               In September, Ashley began operating “Ashley Home Dining,” allowing customers to order their food through the delivery app Baedal Minjok.          Makino Chaya, LF Food’s seafood buffet restaurant, had launched Chuseok gift sets consisting of their popular food items. The sets were available in two options: the “Jesa ceremony pack” which included namul (seasonal vegetables) and grilled croaker; and the “Chuseok party pack” which contained japchae (stir-fried noodles mixed with vegetables) and jeon (Korean pancake). Customers who placed orders through their phones were able to pick up their gift sets at the restaurant’s branches in Yeoksam-dong, southern Seoul, Pangyo, Gyeonggi, and Gwanggyo, Suwon.             “Buffet restaurants in Korea expected to see a long-term struggle from the second wave of Covid-19,” Seo Yong-gu, a professor of business administration at Sookmyung Women’s University, said. “They have been offering delivery and takeout services temporarily or even changing their operating systems in order to survive.”           BY BAE JUNG-WON   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

51,Sale of Doosan Infracore stake could be opportunity for Hyundai Heavy,"

     Doosan Infracore’s excavator, which is being supplied to a construction company in Saudi Arabia. [DOOSAN INFRACORE]               Ever since the Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year, Doosan Group has been busy trying to sell off assets to improve its financial structure.           Among the latest selloffs is Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction’s shares in Doosan Infracore, a leading construction heavy equipment maker in Korea.             The preliminary bidding took place on Sept. 28.           Hyundai Heavy Industries Group, private equity fund MBK Partners and investment company Glenwood Private Equity were among the bidders attempting to purchase the 36 percent stake Doosan Heavy holds in Doosan Infracore.           Doosan group could not confirm the date the final bidder would be selected, but market watchers project Hyundai Heavy to be one of the strongest candidates due to the synergy effect it could generate with its subsidiary Hyundai Construction Equipment.           The country’s No.2 construction equipment maker is 33.12 percent controlled by Hyundai Heavy Industries Group.               Uncertainties      In early August, Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings denied reports that it is considering a takeover of Doosan Infracore. But its stance changed after Doosan Group said that it will repay any additional debts of Doosan Infracore’s Chinese unit.           Currently, Doosan Infracore is in a legal battle with its financial investors.           In 2011, a group of financial investors, including Mirae Asset Global Investment Private Equity, acquired a 20 percent stake in Doosan Infracore China on the condition they retrieve the investment after the Chinese unit goes public within three years. Doosan Infracore China couldn’t go public, and the financial investors tried to sell their shares in the company without success. They filed a lawsuit against Doosan Infracore, saying that the company didn’t cooperate in efforts to sell the shares.           The investors are currently waiting for a Supreme Court decision. In the appeals trial, the court took the side of the financial investors. If the ruling isn’t overturned, Doosan Infracore could face up to 700 billion won ($598.44 million) worth of debt, which is the total amount of investment the investors injected plus the interest that has piled up over the years since the issue was taken to court.           But now that Doosan Group has promised to be responsible for the consequences of the legal battle, the value of Doosan Infracore has risen. The initial date for preliminary bidding was Sept. 22, but Credit Suisse, which arranged the deal, pushed the date to Sept. 28 after Doosan Group made the announcement due to a possible change in value.           The price of Doosan Heavy’s shares in Doosan Infracore is now estimated at between 800 billion won and a trillion won.               Synergy effect      Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings took part in the bidding in a consortium with KDB Investment, a subsidiary of the state-run Korean Development Bank.             The consortium is seen as a major candidate in the bidding due to the synergy effect that can be generated between Doosan Infracore and Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings’ subsidiary Hyundai Construction Equipment.             Following the acquisition, Hyundai Heavy Industry Holdings is projected to become the world’s fifth largest construction equipment manufacturer. In 2018, Doosan Infracore’s global market share for construction equipment accounted for 3.7 percent, ranking ninth, while Hyundai Construction Equipment stood at 20th with 1.5 percent market share.           “Hyundai Construction Equipment will be able to generate a synergy effect through the acquisition because it can secure Doosan Infracore’s supply and distribution networks and share technologies,” said analyst Lee Dong-heon from Daishin Securities. “Securing the networks and technologies has become particularly important due to the intensified competition from competitors in the Chinese market.”           China is one of Doosan Infracore’s largest markets.           But the exclusion of Doosan Bobcat, another construction equipment maker under Doosan Group, from the acquisition deal could be seen as a factor that reduces the value of the deal.           Doosan Bobcat, which is 51.05 percent owned by Doosan Infracore, reported $52.44 million in operating profit in the first half of this year on $788.47 million in sales.             In the second quarter, Doosan Bobcat accounted for 48 percent of Doosan Infracore’s total sales, which stood at 1.98 trillion won.           Following the sales of Doosan Infracore shares, Doosan Group is likely able to raise 3 trillion won. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, its creditors — Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Korea — have injected 3.6 trillion won into Doosan Heavy.           Doosan group is unloading other core assets, including Doosan Tower and Doosan Solus, an electronics parts maker.             BY JIN MIN-JI  [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]               Related ArticleDoosan Tower sells for 800 billion won as financial woes continueDoosan Heavy plans to issue $1.1B in new stockDoosan Bobcat to manufacture small excavators in ChinaDoosan Heavy received key certification for 3D printingDoosan Infracore's excavator sales in China up 10%"

53,South's military overheard order to kill fisheries official,"

     In this file photo, a North Korean patrol boat is observed near the North's Daesuap Island from the South's Yeonpyeong Island on June 21, 2020. [YONHAP]               South Korea was listening in on North Korean military communications when the regime ordered its soldiers to shoot and kill a missing fisheries official found at sea but did nothing, sources from the National Assembly said Tuesday.             According to the sources from the National Assembly's National Defense Committee and Intelligence Committee, the military was eavesdropping on North Korean communications on Sept. 22. Around 3:30 p.m., the North discovered a South Korean civil servant floating in its waters. The man, surnamed Lee, went missing the previous day while on an inspection at sea.             ""We did not announce it because of concerns about our relations with North Korea, but we wiretap and eavesdrop on the North's communications in real time,"" a source from the National Defense Committee told the JoongAng Ilbo. ""We eavesdropped on the communication that a [North Korean patrol boat] was reporting to the Naval Command.""           According to the sources, a written report was sent to President Moon Jae-in around 6:36 p.m. on Sept. 22 that the missing Lee had been captured by the North Korean military.           The North's Naval Command issued an order to the soldiers after 9 p.m. to open fire to kill the man, the sources said, based on the eavesdropped communications.           In an interview with TBS Radio Tuesday morning, Rep. Min Hong-chul of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), who is chairman of the National Defense Committee, admitted that the South Korean military was listening to the North's communications.           ""[The patrol boat that found Lee] asked its upper chain of command what it should do with him,"" Min said. ""During this course of reporting, an order was issued to open fire at him. I was briefed that a speedboat came and shot him.""           Later in the day, Yonhap News Agency reported some details of the eavesdropped communications, quoting sources in the National Assembly. ""I want to confirm it again,"" a North Korean captain asked the command, the sources told Yonhap. ""Shoot and kill? Is this real?""           Min, however, told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday that he did not want to confirm the report.           A source from the Intelligence Committee said soldiers on the North Korean patrol boat were debating whether or not they were ordered to shoot and kill Lee. ""It is true that there was such a dialogue,"" he said.           Another source from the National Defense Committee also told the JoongAng Ilbo that the North Korean soldiers had discussed the shoot-and-kill order.           According to the sources, the military heard the North Korean patrol boat reporting to its chain of command that the man was shot and killed around 9:40 p.m.           ""Before Lee was killed, the military should have made efforts through the United Nations to repatriate him,"" a source from the National Defense Committee said.           The military spent nearly an hour before informing the Blue House around 10:30 p.m. of Lee's fatal shooting. Concerned ministers held an emergency meeting at 1 a.m. on Sept. 23, and President Moon was briefed about the situation at 8:30 a.m.             The South Korean military also confirmed through the eavesdropped communications that Lee apparently had a conversation with North Koreans nearby, which contradicts North Korea's assertion to the South on Friday that it only talked to him from about 80 meters (260 feet) away.             The eavesdropped communications showed that Lee told the North that he wanted to defect, suggesting that the two sides had a conversation at a relatively close distance. Experts have said having a dialogue at sea about 80 meters away is difficult due to the sound of waves and the North Korean ship's engine noise.             According to the eavesdropped communications, the North Korean soldiers initially had the intention of rescuing Lee.       The source said North Korean soldiers first used a rope to tow Lee, who was reportedly wearing a life jacket and was on a floating object, to land. They, however, lost him in the waters.             After two hours searching, they discovered Lee again and held onto him. The situation, however, changed around 9 p.m. when the Naval Command ordered them to shoot and kill him.           Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense denied that it had detected intelligence about the North's order to shoot and kill Lee. The Blue House also denied that it was eavesdropping on the North's communications.           BY HAN YOUNG-IK, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
54,Google Play puts squeeze on app developers,"

     [REUTERS]               Korean IT companies are furious over Google’s Monday announcement that it would collect a 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases in applications downloaded from its Play Store starting early next year.           Game apps have been required to use Google Play’s in-app payment system for in-app purchases by gamers, and Google took a 30 percent commission. Now that applies to apps in all categories including e-book, webtoon, music, video streaming and subscription services. Those apps did not have to use Google's payment system and could use others, such as credit cards.           The official implementation date of the policy is Jan. 20, but apps that are already doing business with Google have an extension until Sept. 30, 2021.           Google clarified that developers can always take payments through their official websites, which would not incur the 30 percent commission, but would be far less convenient.           In an online press briefing Tuesday, Google explained to local media that the billing policy is necessary to re-invest in the platform and that it offers a “safe, reliable” payment system that benefits both users and developers.           Apple already requires apps sold in its App Store to use its payment system and surrender a 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases.           Google’s policy change means a lot to Korean IT services as it runs the largest app store in the country. Google Play has a 63.4 percent market share in Korea. Korean consumers paid 5.9 trillion won ($5 billion) through Google Play’s payment system last year, according to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association (Moiba). Apple took a 25 percent market share last year, and One Store, a domestic service, accounted for around 10 percent.           Google said Tuesday that 99 percent of Korean apps will not be affected by the in-app purchases policy, considering that many mobile apps don't offer in-app purchases.           “To say the impact is small because only 1 percent is affected — that’s just playing with numbers,” said Kim Jae-hwan, policy bureau director at the Korea Internet Corporations Association, or K-Internet, a nonprofit organization that represents domestic IT firms. “That 1 percent was equivalent to nearly 6 trillion won,"" he added, referring to Moiba's data.           According to Kim, many local apps that make revenue through in-app purchases are distributors of content such as e-books, webtoons and videos. Setting aside copyright fees paid to the original creator and costs, these start-ups take 20 to 30 percent of revenue as profit. Paying a 30 percent commission to Google leaves them with almost nothing, he said.           Industry analysts say the burden could eventually be passed on to consumers in the form of price hikes. For some services, customers already pay a different price depending on their device. At Naver Webtoon, for example, one cookie — the token needed to purchase cartoon episodes — costs 100 won on Android devices but 120 won on Apple devices.           Following media reports in July that Google had contacted local IT firms about plans to change the in-app purchases policy, Korea’s IT and start-up industry has been lobbying policymakers to stop the action.           After Google’s announcement, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) announced Tuesday it was starting an investigation into whether the policy change violates the Telecommunications Business Act.           “Unlike Apple, which implemented this policy from the start, Google is making a change after acquiring market dominance based on its open source policy,” Korea Communications Commission Chair Han Sang-hyuk said in a National Assembly meeting on Sept. 2, where he hinted at the possibility of looking into Google’s actions.           As of mid-September, there were three bills submitted for review to the National Assembly that would make reforms to the Telecommunications Business law that would stop app markets from forcing their in-app payment system on app developers.    It’s questionable how effective domestic law would be in stopping Google from implementing a global policy.           “The same issue had been raised with Apple since the early 2000s and yet there was no proper investigation,"" said Choi Sung-jin, executive board director of the Korea Startup Forum, at a Sept. 21 conference. ""This time, regulators should suggest a clear stance.           “Even if they fail to stop [foreign app store operators], they need to make clear that such actions go against the fair trade law or the Telecommunications Business Act. I believe their murky attitude sent a wrong signal to the market that such actions are acceptable.”           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

56,'Made in Korea' becomes a must as supply chains collapse,"

  As the coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy and manufacturing hubs like China went into lockdown, the extent to which Korea relies on foreign suppliers very quickly became clear.           The shutdown of factories abroad triggered shortages of parts for major manufacturers in Korea, pushing companies like Hyundai Motor to suspend factory operations back in February.           That production stopping on the other side of the world could so quickly bring Korean manufacturers to their knees exposed just how important localizing suppliers is. Producing essential parts and materials at home was a hot-button political issue even before Covid-19 arrived, after Japan imposed restrictions on exports to Korea of three key materials last year.         관련기사[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] [Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Letting the robots take over is the secret to social distancing[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Dark stores are all the rage as e-commerce takes over        BY JEON TAE-GYU [jeon.taegyu@joongang.co.kr]    "

[YONHAP]               Health authorities urged travelers to take extra precautions as over 2 million people are expected to hit the road on the five-day Chuseok holiday, even though Korea’s new coronavirus cases dropped to below 50 Tuesday for the first time since early August.           The country kept new cases in the double digits for the fifth consecutive day, adding 38 Covid-19 patients, of which 23 were local infections and 15 imported, as of Monday midnight, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).           This was the lowest number of cases in 49 days, since the country recorded 34 cases on Aug. 11. That was right before a spike in cases especially in the Seoul metropolitan area after new clusters emerged from a church in Seongbuk District and an antigovernment rally downtown on Liberation Day on Aug. 15.             Korea recorded a total of 23,699 Covid-19 cases, with one additional death reported, according to the KDCA Tuesday, raising the death toll to 407, with a fatality rate of 1.72 percent.           There were 11 new cases in Seoul and six in Gyeonggi, the first time since Aug. 11 that daily infections in the metropolitan area dropped below 20. Three cases were in Busan and two in North Gyeongsang.                      Despite recent coronavirus figures showing a downward trend, Second Vice Health Minister Kang Do-tae said Tuesday, “We urge the people to continue to remain vigilant so that the Chuseok holiday does not become a catalyst for a nationwide spread of Covid-19.”           The government continues to maintain Level 2 in its three-tier social distancing scheme but has also introduced some tailored precautionary measures for the holidays.           The Korea Expressway Corporation said that all indoors seating at expressway rest stops will be shut for six days from Tuesday to Sunday as a part of enhanced social distancing measures.           Restaurants at all expressway rest stops will be prohibited from serving food and only be allowed to provide take-out service to visitors, who will be encouraged to eat in their cars. Travelers will also be required to log in with mobile phone numbers when they drop by.           Travelers will not be exempted from expressway tolls from Wednesday to Friday, as they have been on previous national holidays, a move by the government to dissuade people from traveling.             The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport estimates that the number of people return to their hometowns this year will shrink to 2.759 million travelers, or 30 percent less than 2019.           The Transport Ministry estimates that 91.4 percent of travelers will be taking private vehicles, 5.7 percent buses and 1.9 percent trains.           More traffic was expected on the highways this year travelers choose to drive as opposed to taking public transportation. Health authorities urged family members that do not live in the same household to wear masks if they travel in the same vehicle.           Health authorities have been keen on preventing a ""twindemic,"" with Covid-19 infections coinciding with flu season in the fall. Korea next week has another three-day break from Oct. 9 to 11, coinciding with Hangul Day.           Health authorities confirmed as of noon Tuesday that 10 Covid-19 cases are related to a munitions company in Seongnam, Gyeonggi.           An infection cluster traced to a sauna in Gwanak District in southern Seoul has 29 related cases so far. Another traced to an elderly care center in Dobong District in northern Seoul has 27 patients.           Small gatherings continue to remain sources of infections, with seven related to family members living in Gunpo and Anyang in Gyeonggi and another 11 to a group of elderly people in Pohang, North Gyeonsang.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]              An elderly woman at a nursing home in Suwon, Gyeonggi, holds a video call with her daughter Tuesday ahead of Chuseok instead of an in-person visit, following with Covid-19 social distancing guidelines.

""At the same time, we will introduce a bill to appoint an independent counsel.""           After an eight-month probe, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office announced Monday that it found no grounds on which to indict Choo, her son surnamed Seo and her former aide on allegations that Seo had been let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of his sick leave in June 2017. His leave at the time had already been extended once. Choo was accused of using her influence to get a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days.           Seo served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, from November 2016 through August 2018. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).           Joo also criticized the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office for trying to minimize public attention on the case.           ""The people are paying attention to the North's killing of a South Korean public servant and the media are quiet as the Chuseok holidays are about to begin,"" Joo said.

She also received a reply from her aide on how he had handled the extension of Seo's leave.           Their communication appeared to be at odds with Choo's repeated remarks in the National Assembly that she had never ordered her aide to ask the military to extend her son's leave.           ""Why would my aide to take an order for my personal matter?"" Choo said when she attended the National Assembly's Special Committee on Budget and Accounts on Sept. 1.           During a National Assembly hearing on Sept. 14, Choo said, ""I have never made an order.""           Despite the messages, the prosecution said it will not indict Choo because she only received reports from her aide without explicitly ordering him to extend her son's leave.           Meanwhile, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office will continue its investigation into other suspicions surrounding Seo's military service.           Suspicions were raised that improper pressure was applied to assign Seo to the Yongsan Garrison after he finished boot camp, and to select him as a military interpreter for 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

62,"Fisheries official was defecting, says Coast Guard","

     Yoon Sung-hyun, chief of investigation and intelligence at the Coast Guard, gives a briefing Tuesday to reporters on a South Korean fisheries official's shooting death last week. [YONHAP]                A fisheries official who went missing near the maritime border last Monday before being shot and killed by North Korean soldiers last Tuesday, clearly made efforts to move northward against southward currents, the Coast Guard said, in order to defect to the North.           The Coast Guard held a press conference Tuesday morning to announce the conclusion of its investigation so far into the shooting death of the 47-year-old employee of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service. The victim, surnamed Lee, went missing on Sept. 21 in waters south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea. He was shot and killed by North Korean soldiers north of the NLL on Sept. 22.           Exactly how and why Lee ended up in the North has been a mystery, though Seoul military officials said last week they strongly believed he tried to defect to the North, which his family adamantly denies.           According to Yoon Sung-hyun, chief of investigation and intelligence at the Coast Guard, the agency concluded that Lee was trying to defect to the North based on military intelligence and a study projecting his expected movement in the waters.           Because Lee was wearing a life jacket, the Coast Guard believes it is unlikely he accidentally fell into the water or was attempting suicide, Yoon said.           “Our investigators visited the Ministry of National Defense yesterday to confirm some details,” Yoon said. “When an exhausted Lee was found in the North, he was wearing a life jacket and holding onto a floating object.           “According to the military, the North knew some specifics of Lee’s personal information such as his name, age, hometown and height,” Yoon said. “We also confirmed circumstances that Lee had told the North his intention to defect.”           It was unclear how the military became aware of anything Lee may have told the North. The Defense Ministry did not share the information with the Coast Guard.           The Coast Guard’s conclusion differs from details in a recent message from North Korea. Last week, the North told the South that it approached an “illegal intruder” and tried to confirm his identity, but he gave ambiguous responses. The North said Lee was trying to escape after its soldiers fired blanks at him, so it had to open fire.           Although the South’s military said the North burned Lee's body, the North said it only burned a floating object Lee was on, claiming that his body was not discovered.           The Coast Guard also said Tuesday scientific studies back its conclusion that Lee was trying to defect.           Based on studies of four research institutes including the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, Lee, if he was accidentally set adrift, should have floated in a southwestern direction, Yoon said. Lee, however, was shot and killed in North Korean waters about 38 kilometers (24 miles) northwest of where he went missing.             The Coast Guard said it conducted an experiment by using an object similar to Lee’s height of 180 centimeters (5 feet, 11 inches) and weight of 72 kilograms (159 pounds). The object was dropped in waters near Soyeonpyeong Island, where Lee went missing, and its movement was similar to the studies.           “There is a significant difference between our adrift course projection and the actual location where Lee was discovered,” Yoon said. “Without man-made efforts, it is impossible for him to have actually drifted to this location.”           Experts said a man in stable health, assisted by a life jacket and a floating object, is capable of swimming to the location in the northern waters, Yoon said.           “Lee graduated from a fisheries school,” a Coast Guard official said. “He was working on a fisheries inspection ship for nearly 10 years and he knew very well about the waters near Yeonpyeong Island. Based on the findings so far, we believe he was trying to defect to the North.           “Lee had a total of 330 million won [$282,000] in debt,” the official said, “and 268 million won was from online gambling. But we should not jump to the conclusion that he wanted to defect to the North because of the debts.”           The Coast Guard said it will continue forensic investigation of the boat Mugunghwa 10, from which Lee went missing, and question his associates.           While the Coast Guard concluded in the morning that Lee was killed while making an attempt to defect to North Korea, his family held a press conference in the afternoon to refute the notion.              Lee Rae-jin, elder brother of the victim, holds a press conference at the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club on Tuesday to denounce the Moon Jae-in administration for having failed to rescue his brother.  [YONHAP]                Lee’s elder brother, Lee Rae-jin, said the Moon Jae-in administration had two windows of opportunities to rescue the victim.             “After my brother went missing and was adrift in the waters for 30 hours, the government and the military did nothing to find and rescue him,” Lee said. “He ended up crossing the NLL into the North. Although there was time before his death, the military made no effort to save him as it was observing the situation for six hours.           “Although the military said it had no emergency contact with the North, the North Korean military broadcast warnings when my brother reached close to the NLL,” Lee said. “The South Korean military immediately aired its response. What is the truth?”           Lee also said his brother had no reason to defect because he had a solid career as a fisheries official. “My brother must have had faith that his country and his brother would rescue him,” Lee said. “I am ashamed that we failed him.”           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

     LG Electronics presented the world's first rollable OLED TV during CES 2020 in January. [YONHAP]               LG Electronics is reportedly planning to release its rollable TV by the end of October. The company has already been accepting orders from its customers in the highest level of membership.           LG has created a limited-access website dedicated to the LG Signature OLED TV R and began to receive orders from those customers, according to industry experts. The exclusive event for VVIP customers will be held at the Banyan Tree Club and Spa Seoul in Jung District of central Seoul from Oct. 14 to 19.             The new rollable TV has a 65-inch display, offers 4K picture quality and comes with a rectangular speaker. The display has three modes: full view; ""line view,"" for displaying time, music and photographs; and ""zero view,"" in which the television slides down into the sound speaker box upon a click of the remote control. Local media have reported that the estimated price is 100 million won ($85,600), about twice as expensive as LG's 8K OLED TV, which has an 88-inch display.           The company said the product is notable for its paper-thin screen and innovative technology that allows the television to take up minimal space at homes, unlike conventional televisions. The flexible characteristics of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) allow the TV to roll up and down.           LG showcased the world’s first rollable TV during the CES in 2019, and the product was originally supposed to go on sale that same year. However, LG postponed the release date.           BY KIM YOUNG-MIN, LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

65,"Seoul, Washington talk 'creatively' about Pyongyang","

     South Korea’s top nuclear envoy Lee Do-hoon, left, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun speak to reporters after holding bilateral talks at the U.S. Department of State in Washington on Monday. [YONHAP]               U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said he discussed ""creative” and “constructive” ways to prod along stalled denuclearization negotiations with Pyongyang in talks with South Korea's top nuclear envoy, Lee Do-hoon, Monday.             Biegun told reporters after the talks in Washington, ""The United States and the Republic of Korea remain fully committed to diplomacy as a way to reach an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula, to achieve denuclearization, to bring about a brighter future for all of the Korean people, and to bring about normalcy in the United States' relationship with the DPRK.” DPRK is the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.           Lee, Seoul’s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, kicked off a trip to Washington Sunday, a visit which came after a South Korean fisheries official was confirmed to have been shot by North Korea last week.             “I very much appreciate the encouragement and the creative ideas that we discussed today,” said Biegun. “The U.S. and ROK cannot do this by ourselves. We need the DPRK engaged, and we remain open to the discussion with them when they're prepared.” ROK is the acronym for South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.           Denuclearization negotiations between the United States and North Korea have been at a standstill since last year, and the two sides were not able to resolve differences in their last working-level talks in October 2019 in Sweden.           Biegun said he discussed with Lee the tragic killing of a fisheries official in the West Sea — something that was deeply disturbing to the Korean people and certainly to the United States of America.”           He added that they also “talked about constructive ways to continue to advance our diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula together.”           North Korea on Friday made an apology for the fatal shooting of the South Korean fisheries official, who was shot by North Korean soldiers on Sept. 22 after he went missing near the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea the previous day. The rare apology citing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was seen by analysts as a move by Pyongyang to mitigate any international backlash over the shocking shooting, and a U.S. State Department spokesperson Friday called it a “helpful step.”           Biegun’s remark on discussion of “constructive ways” with Lee is seen to encompass Seoul’s proposal for an end-of-war declaration.             Lee told reporters at Dulles Airport in Washington on Sunday that he planned to discuss the issue of signing a declaration to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a ceasefire.           He said, “There were many occasions when the U.S. took interest in and reviewed the idea of officially ending the Korean War.”           President Moon Jae-in in a virtual address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 22 called for global support for an end-of-war declaration to bring about “complete denuclearization and permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.""           Lee told reporters Monday that the latest meeting was the “best one among recent talks.” He stressed that cooperation between Seoul and Washington is more important than at any other time and that they will continue discussions in the future through various methods and opportunities.             Biegun, who doubles as the U.S. special representative for North Korea, has advocated a flexible policy toward Pyongyang and signaled that he is always ready to continue working-level talks with the North when he last visited Seoul in late July.           However, the latest report by a panel of experts published by the UN Security Council released Monday found that as of 2020, North Korea “has maintained its nuclear facilities and has continued to produce fissile material.”           It also found the North “has continued to violate Security Council resolutions through the illicit import of refined petroleum products through ship-to-ship transfers and direct deliveries.”           The report said that Ha Won Mo and Kim Hak Chol, representatives of the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid), North’s state-owned arms dealer that is subject to UN sanctions, were in Iran as of the beginning of 2020.           The panel also found that Syria invited more than 800 North Korean laborers to work in the country in the second half of 2019, and some were reported to have worked at a Syrian surface-to-air missile unit.             Furthermore, deliveries of refined petroleum products to North Korea from Jan. 1 to May 30 “already far exceeded the aggregate amount of 500,000 barrels set by the Security Council as the annual ceiling for 2020.”           According to several assessments, North Korea “probably developed miniaturized nuclear devices to fit into the warheads of its ballistic missiles.” The panel also assesses, citing an unnamed country, that North Korea may seek to further develop miniaturization “in order to allow the incorporation of technological improvements, such as penetration aid packages, or, potentially, to develop multiple warhead systems.”           However, the Security Council is also taking into consideration humanitarian exemption requests related to Covid-19 relief and “exercised flexibility with regard to extensions of the exemption period.”           Lee and Biegun’s meeting in Washington comes amid a series of exchanges between South Korean and U.S. senior officials that have taken place in recent days.           Kim Hyun-chong, the deputy chief of the Blue House National Security Office, visited Washington on Sept. 16 for a five-day trip, the Blue House confirmed Sunday, and met officials from the White House, U.S. State Department, Pentagon and Commerce Department and experts at U.S. think tanks.           Marshall Billingslea, the U.S. special presidential envoy for arms control, visited Seoul Monday and held talks with Ham Sang-wook, the deputy minister for multilateral and global affairs. They discussed ways for the two countries to cooperate in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, including on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Billingslea also made a courtesy call on First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun and the two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations, according to the Korean Foreign Ministry.             U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is also expected to make his first trip to Seoul in two years next week as Washington pushes for support from allies amid intensified Sino-U.S. tensions.             Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is also expected to make a visit to South Korea in mid-October on the heels of Pompeo’s visit to the region, which will also take him to Japan. Wang had been reported in Japanese media as planning a visit to Tokyo following the inauguration of new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.             British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also visited Seoul Tuesday for strategic talks with Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha to discuss trade and security matters, Covid-19 response, Brexit and Korean Peninsula and other regional issues.           Raab, on his first visit to the country, paid a visit to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) earlier in the day.           In his opening remarks, Raab recalled that 80,000 British military personnel fought in the Korean War and said, “We are proud of those ties and we are proud of the solidarity. But we are also looking to the future, eager to take our friendship to the next level.”           He noted, “No other country has a voting record as close to the United Kingdom in international organizations as the Republic of Korea. And I think that speaks for the shared interests and also the shared values. And that is the reason why we’re so keen to come here and have these talks with you.”           Kang likewise said that Britain ""is a key partner for us in all areas,” including trade, policy, culture and finance, and thanked Britain for being “steadfast toward our endeavors to bring about prosperity and lasting peace here on the Korean Peninsula.”           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

67,"This Chuseok, the gift sets are meaty, boozy and pricey","

     Customers line up to buy gift sets ahead of the Chuseok holidays at a discount store in Jung District, central Seoul, Sept. 24. [NEWS1]                Gift sets are flying off the shelves ahead of the Chuseok holiday as fewer people are planning to visit their families due to coronavirus concerns — and need to make up for it.           Expensive sets are particularly popular this year with a temporary lifting of the anti-graft law by the government helping boost consumption.           According to Lotte Mart, sales of Chuseok gift sets from Aug. 13 to Sept. 26 increased 22 percent compared to July 25 through Sept. 8 last year, the corresponding period ahead of last year’s Chuseok holidays.           The record-breaking sales were led by expensive meat products, of which sales jumped by 43 percent on year. Gift sets of alcoholic beverages jumped 39.2 percent on year in line with a growing number of people who prefer to drink at home. Among those, wines priced at 50,000 won ($43) to 100,000 won apparently jumped the most, although the figure wasn't disclosed.           “Many people bought expensive Korean beef gift sets for their parents to make up for their absence this Chuseok,” said a spokesperson for Lotte Shopping. ""The temporary lifting of the anti-graft law, which allowed people to send gifts priced up to 200,000 won, also had an effect.”           At Lotte Department Store, gift set sales went up 5 percent compared to last year. Again, expensive gift sets sold best, with sales of alcohol, fruit sets and meat jumping an average of 15 percent on year. This is a big contrast with last year when the three most popular items were relatively low-priced items like Wagashi-style sweets and nuts.              The meat section is fully stocked with high-end Korean beef ahead of the Chuseok holidays at the Shinsegae Department Store in Jung District, central Seoul, on Sept. 24. [YONHAP]               Premium gift sets performed especially well at discount retailer Emart. Gift sets of premium meat, normally priced above 200,000 won, increased by 16.4 percent compared to the same period last year. Among alcoholic beverages, whiskey gift sets — the most expensive among alcoholic beverages — sold the most with sales increasing by 13 percent compared to last year. Total sales of Chuseok gifts inched up 3 percent as of Sept. 28 on year.             By price, gift sets priced higher than 200,000 won outperformed others with sales jumping 13.9 percent on the year. Gift sets priced in the 100,000-won range also did well with sales increasing 10 percent on year.             “People used to think they have to buy Chuseok gifts for everyone they know,” said a spokesperson for Emart. ""But now, customers prefer to spend their money wisely and focus on those they think really deserve it.""           Wine was also popular at Emart, with sales rising 18.2 percent compared to the previous year. Sales of expensive bottles costing 200,000 won jumped 28 percent on year. In the case of wine sets priced over 1 million won, sales jumped a whopping 40 percent on year.           “Expensive wine consumption has grown as more people could not dine out or go on trips overseas during the holiday season. That demand trickled down to discount stores,” said the Emart spokesperson.           Sales jumped for all types of alcohol. Gift sets of imported beer jumped 64.2 percent on year and traditional liquor sales leaped by 95.4 percent.           “Premium gift sets performed well with more people giving up their annual visit to their relatives. Health supplements sold well as more people were concerned about staying healthy from the pandemic. The jump in wine sales was a result of more customers opting to drink at home rather than go out to bars,” explained Choi Hoon-hak, a marketer at Emart.             With the temporary lifting of the anti-graft law, the government has hinted at the possibility it might keep the suspension going to help farmers struggling from the pandemic.           “We will conduct a careful analysis to see how much of a positive effect the temporary suspension of the anti-graft law had in boosting sales,” said the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs at a meeting Monday.             BY JEON YOUNG-SEON, KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Singer Kim Hyung-jun [JTBC]               Singer Kim Hyung-jun, a former member of boy band SS501, has won the defamation case he filed against a woman referred to as “female A” who falsely accused him of sexual assault, his agency SDKB announced on Tuesday.              Kim sued “female A” for false accusations and defamation after she filed a lawsuit against him in March last year, claiming that she had been sexually assaulted by Kim 10 years ago at her house.           “Female A” was sentenced to eight months in prison for making the false accusations and defamation at a sentencing hearing held at the Goyang branch of the Uijeongbu District Court on Sept. 25.           Police dropped the charges against Kim in June last year after finding no grounds to indict him. He subsequently filed the defamation suit claiming he had to suffer from continuous defamation of character and malicious rumors ever since, which created massive financial and psychological damage.           BY KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

73,Ryu and Kim set for Chuseok starts as Wild Card Series begins,"

     Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays, left, and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals will both start in Wild Card Series games on Wednesday. [AP/YONHAP]               With the MLB’s shortened 60-game season now completed, three of the four Korean major leaguers are expected to appear in the postseason this year.           The MLB's inaugural Wild Card Series will get underway with the American League starting its games on Tuesday, local time, or Wednesday morning in Korea.            This season, the MLB regular season schedule was not the only change caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The postseason has been expanded to a 16-team field, making room for eight teams each from the American and National Leagues.            Along with that, the Wild Card Series is no longer sudden-death. The major league has introduced a series format for the first time ever, to be played as a best of three. All three games, assuming there are three games, will be played at the home of the higher-seeded team.            Following the best-of-three Wild Card Series, the Division Series will be played in a best-of-five format while the League Championship Series will be played in a best-of-seven format. Teams will have be playing without any break between the postseason games.            Finally, the 116th MLB World Series will be played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, with Game 1 scheduled to start on Oct. 20.           Thanks to the new series format, Korean baseball fans will once again get to see the two Korean major league pitchers — Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals — start on the same day.            Although the Blue Jays are stating their Wild Card Series a day earlier than the Cardinals, thanks to the new format, both Ryu and Kim will be making their starts on Wednesday. Kim in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series for the Cardinals, and Ryu in Game 2 for the Blue Jays.           Once again, the Blue Jays will start their game first, as it is set to start at 5 a.m. on Thursday morning, Korea time.            As the Blue Jays’ ace pitcher, there were high expectations that manager Charlie Montoyo would assign Ryu as the starter in Game 1 of the Wild Card Series against the Tampa Bay Rays. Instead, Montoyo chose Matt Shoemaker to start off the series and Ryu to start in Game 2.            “In a three-game series, the goal is to win two of them,” Montoyo was quoted as saying on MLB.com. “Putting our ace in the middle makes sense to us for several reasons. Plus, our bullpen is fully rested. We said we were going to be creative from the beginning, and that’s one of the reasons we got here, being creative.”           By starting in Game 2 of the Wild Card Series, Ryu gets another day to rest after his latest start against the New York Yankees on Sept. 24. However, this also puts a lot of pressure on the 32-year-old — if the Blue Jays lose Game 1, Ryu will be tasked with keeping the club alive. If they win Game 1, it will Ryu's job to take the Blue Jays to the Division Series.           “It’s not like when you play a two out of three when you’re on the road,” Montoyo was quoted as saying, “and you feel like you need to split the series and then you can go home 1-1. There’s a difference here. The three games are going to be held [at Tropicana Field], so all games count. We feel like that’s our best chance.”           Finishing the regular season on a high note, Ryu will be looking to continue that momentum. In his last start of the season, Ryu pitched seven scoreless innings against the Yankees.            Looking at his performance in his first season with the Blue Jays, Ryu lived up to his big four-year $80-million contract.            Ryu got off to a slow start in the 2020 season. In the Blue Jays’ opening game against the Rays, he gave up three runs throughout four and two-thirds of an inning and walked away with a no decision. Then, against the Washington Nationals in his second game, things got worse as Ryu picked up a loss, giving up five runs throughout four and one-third of an inning.            But he slowly picked up his pace and saved the best for last. With a win, Ryu finished his season by picking up five wins and two losses with a 2.69 ERA.            In addition to his personal statistics, that final big win also secured the club’s postseason berth.            Just an hour after Ryu's game gets underway, the Cardinals will start their Wild Card Series against the San Diego Padres, starting at 6 a.m. on Thursday, Korea time.            When the Cardinals announced their starters for the Wild Card Series, Kim getting the nod for Game 1 came as a surprise. Considering Kim is a rookie in the major league this season, being tipped for Game 1 of the postseason adds to an already successful year.            Kim started out his season with the Cardinals from the bullpen, but quickly made it into the starting rotation midway through the season, when a number of Cardinals players tested positive for Covid-19. That move turned out to be a success as he finished his rookie season with three wins and a save with a 1.62 ERA.            As Kim also picked up a win in his last start of the regular season, against the Milwaukee Brewers on Sept. 24, he and Ryu managed to pick up wins on the same day in a major league game, the first time two Korean pitchers have done so since 2005.            In the regular season, the two pitchers started on the same day in four games and it was only in the final one that they managed to both pick up a win. As the Cardinals are the fifth-seeded team in the Wild Card Series, they’ll be playing their games at Petco Park, the Padres’ home ground.               Choi Ji-man of the Tampa Bay Rays hopes to play during the Wild Card Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, starting from Tuesday. [AP/YONHAP]               Along with the two pitchers, Choi Ji-man of the Rays will also be hoping to make an appearance in the postseason. Despite the Rays being the top seeded team in the Wild Card series, it’s uncertain whether Choi will get a chance to play, as he's been out with a hamstring injury since a game against the Boston Red Sox on Sept. 12.            Since then, Choi has been rehabilitating and there has been positive news regarding his comeback. Currently, the Rays are missing two key players from their batting lineup — Choi, Yandy Diaz and pitcher Jose Alvarado.           The Rays still hadn’t finalized their roster for the Wild Card Series as of press time, and manager Kevin Cash has until Tuesday 10 a.m. local time to submit it. Both Choi and Diaz were seen on training with the Rays.            Playing as the Rays’ first baseman and designated hitter this season, Choi had a 0.230 batting average with three home runs, 16 RBIs and 16 runs from 122 at-bats. If Choi does make it to the roster, this will be the second straight season that he has played in the postseason as the Rays appeared last year as well.            In 2019, Choi played in six games for the Rays in the postseason and finished with a 0.188 batting average with one home run and one RBI.            “Positive news on all [three players],” Rays manager Kevin Cash was quoted as saying on MLB.com. “We still have time, and we’ll buy time to make sure that we’re doing right by the decision, and the roster, by 10 a.m.”           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

79,[SPONSORED REPORTS] SK Broadband B tv launches its first original content,"

     A poster for the new drama series from SK Broadband, ’Zombie Detective,“ which premiered on the Sept. 19 as early access on B tv. [SK BROADBAND]         On the Sept. 19, SK Broadband released the first two episodes of its first original content drama, “Zombie Detective” on B tv as video on demand, or VOD. According to B tv’s weekend audience rating survey for Sept. 19 and 20, Zombie Detective was the second most watched content. Taking into consideration that series, such as foreign seasonal dramas, tend to have smaller audiences that binge-watch all the episodes, making its total viewer number low but its combined watched time high, “Zombie Detective”’s high ratings, which were more than double that of any of B tv’s other new releases on the same weekend, came as a pleasant surprise to channel officials.“Zombie Detective” is a drama produced by RaemongRaein, jointly-invested in by KBS, SK Broadband, and Wavve. This comedy-drama follows the story of a resurrected zombie (played by Choi Jin-hyuk) who remembers nothing of his past. He works as a detective to regain his memory and solve the cases he is assigned. This season had a total of 12 episodes and will likely continue the story in upcoming seasons.Apart from its story and presentation, what made the drama extra special was how it was released. “Zombie Detective”’s original airing date was scheduled to be Sept. 21 on KBS, but B tv exclusively released two episodes prior to its television broadcast. This pre-emptive VOD release, which is contrary to the conventional “TV first, rentable/purchasable services later” strategy, proved B tv’s foresight and garnered a sizable number of viewers.However, calling this early-access strategy of B tv a novel, unprecedented measure would be a far cry from the company’s previous works and ambition. Having already released Ocean, a monthly subscription plan which provides the widest range of movies in the Korean television market, B tv aims to jump in the over-the-top (OTT) service market and set itself as a formidable original content creator. With its previous investments in Korean films, animations, and documentaries, B tv is taking its first step with the launch of “Zombie Detective.”“For us, ‘Zombie Detective’ is like a new start, as well as a new challenge. We hope this drama can act as a starting point for B tv’s numerous other original content creations,” said an official from SK Broadband.By Ahn Tae-lahm [ahn.taelahm@joongang.co.kr]   "
80,Magok's Space K Seoul transforms area into arts and culture hot spot ,"

     Kolon Group's new art museum named Space K Seoul in Magok of western Seoul. [SPACE K SEOUL]               Magok, located in a far western area of Seoul, 10 minutes from Gimpo International Airport by car, is emerging as a new hot place for arts and culture as well as high-tech industries. A fortnight ago, Kolon Group opened an art museum named Space K Seoul in the area, after the conglomerate relocated the headquarters of its major affiliates to its new building Kolon One & Only Tower in Magok in 2018.           The new museum, designed by Korean architect Cho Minsuk, is a five-minute walk from the Kolon One & Only Tower, designed by American studio Morphosis Architects. The fan-shaped museum building, whose area totals 2,044 square meters, has a sloped roof covered partly with grass and partly with wide steps, which can be used as an auditorium for small-scale concerts and performances.            People can approach the roof space through another staircase directly from the adjacent small park on the ground level. ""Cho designed the museum to play the role of not only a cultural space but also a park for the residents and workers in this area,"" explained Hwang In-sung, a curator of the museum. Cho, founder of the Mass Studies studio, curated the Korean Pavilion exhibition for the 2014 Venice Biennale of Architecture, which won the prestigious Golden Lion award.            Just a seven-minute walk from Space K Seoul stands the Seoul Botanical Park, which was set up in May 2019. In a site adjacent to the botanical garden, a new building will be constructed — one that has been designed by the renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando to house the LG Arts Center, which will be moved from the current GS Tower in southern Seoul. As one of Seoul's most popular theaters for plays, musicals and multidisciplinary performances, LG Arts Center will reopen in 2022 in an extended form in the new building. The relocation of the theater follows the LG Group's move that opened its research and development complex named LG Science Park in Magok.             Meanwhile, Space K Seoul started its inaugural exhibition ""Distorted Portrait"" which features about 30 pieces including paintings, sculptures, photography and installations by 21 artists that depict human faces or bodies set in a dark reality.                Korean artist Do Ho Suh’s installation work ’High School Uni-Form“ juxtaposed with Chinese artist Zhang Xiaogang’s painting ’Amnesia and Memory No.16“ as part of Space K Seoul’s inaugural exhibition ’Distorted Portrait.“ [MOON SO-YOUNG]                 In a room stands the renowned Korean artist Do Ho Suh's installation work ""High School Uni-Form,"" which is a group of black-colored school uniform pieces linked to each other. The work, based on the artist's memory of his school days when the atmosphere and culture of boys' schools were similar to those of the military, symbolizes the situation that individuals' identities are controlled and unified into that of a group. The work is juxtaposed with the famous Chinese artist Zhang Xiaogang's melancholic portrait painting of a boy, ""Amnesia and Memory No.16"" that suggests suppressed memories of violent events in modern Chinese history.            In another room hangs a group of photographs by the London-based Korean artist Chan-hyo Bae, in which the artist himself poses in old European clothing as some figures of the bloody Tudor history. He is well known for his elaborate mise-en-scene and portrait photos, in which he restages Western folktales and history to explores Western cultural stereotypes and alienation based on what Bae experienced as an Asian man in Britain.               Korean artist Meekyoung Shin’s soap sculpture ’Written in Soap: A Plinth Project“ as part of Space K Seoul’s inaugural exhibition ’Distorted Portrait.“  [MOON SO-YOUNG]                  Another London-based Korean artist Meekyoung Shin's sculpture ""Written in Soap: A Plinth Project"" is also among the exhibits. A different edition of the sculpture, which is the recreation in soap of the 18th-century British statue of the Duke of Cumberland, was installed in a 2013 public art project on the empty plinth in London where the original statue once stood but was eventually taken down. The soap sculpture eroded over time as the artist intended. Shin is famous for condensing and visualizing the flow of time that artifacts go through though her recreations of antiques and classic monuments in soap.            In another room, German artist André Butzer's grotesque portrait of a man, ""Untitled(Wanderer),"" faces an even more grotesque sculpture by Pakistani American sculptor Huma Bhabha, ""One Thousand."" When once asked about her sculptures that often look like combinations of a primitive totem and a mummified human body, the artist said in an interview with ArtReview in March, ""I don't want to scare somebody. But life is pretty horrific. It keeps us all horrified."" However, it scared at least one person seriously in this Korean exhibition. ""A cleaning worker saw the work in the dark on one early morning and she was so scared that she quit the job,"" said Lee Jang-uk, senior curator of Space K, who planned the exhibition.               The view of Space K Seoul’s inaugural exhibition ’Distorted Portrait“ with German artist Andre Butzer’s painting ’Untitled(Wanderer),“ left, and Pakistani American artist Huma Bhabha’s sculpture ’One Thousand,“ right.

""However, I wanted to start with dealing with our reality, which we need to talk about more in this Covid-19 pandemic situation.""             Other big names among the participating artists include Korean artist Lee Bul and British art duo Gilbert & George.             ""We have donated this museum to the Seoul city government, while taking charge of its operation for the next 20 years,"" Lee said. ""As the older art spaces of Kolon, such as Space K Gwacheon [south of Seoul], have focused on discovering young or undervalued Korean artists and introducing foreign artists less known here, the new museum will also attach importance to such activities, while holding solo shows of some famous foreign artists."" The solo exhibitions of American artist Hernan Bas and British artist Ryan Gander are scheduled for next year, he added.               By MOON SO-YOUNG   [symoon@joongang.co.kr]           The exhibition ""Distorted Portrait"" runs through Jan. 29, 2021.

Mark Rosati, the culinary director for the U.S. branches of Shake Shack, developed the line and was inspired by his traveling in Korea.             The Gochujang Chicken Shack is chicken breast cooked using the sous-vide method, which is spiced with gochujang glaze and sesame seeds — a taste similar to Korean seasoned chicken. Crunchy kimchi slaw adds more of a Korean taste to the sandwich.             The Gochujang Shack burger is flavored with gochujang mayo sauce. Gochujang fries are a spicy alternative to original fries.             Shake Shack will give out vouchers to customers who win a quiz contest on the Happy Point application. Coupons will be given to those selected from its social media campaign on its Instagram channel.           “The Korean traditional ingredient, gochujang, will harmonize with the rest of the burger and provide a new experience to Koreans and the rest of the world,” said a spokesperson for Shake Shack. “Going forward, Shake Shack will continue to provide a variety of products that suit its vision for the ‘fine casual’ concept.”             BY LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]         "
83,"Celltrion plans merger, holding company transition","

             Celltrion Pharm’s stock price rose Monday following the company's announcement that it would merge three affiliates and adopt a holding company structure by 2021.           Based on the affiliates' current values, the merged entity would have a market capitalization of 52 trillion won ($44 billion), making it the third-largest company on the Kospi after Samsung Electronics and SK hynix.             As a first step, Celltrion announced in a public filing late Friday afternoon that founder and Group Chairman Seo Jung-jin would cash out 24.33 percent of Celltrion Healthcare and use the proceeds to establish a parent company, Celltrion Healthcare Holdings. Seo owns 35.54 percent of Celltrion Healthcare.           If all goes as planned, Celltrion Healthcare Holdings will be merged with Celltrion Holdings by late 2021. Celltrion Holdings holds the other two affiliates, Celltrion and Celltrion Pharm. That would put all three companies under a single holding company.             On Monday, Celltrion Pharm’s stock closed 6.68 percent higher than the previous trading day to reach 110,200 won. This was the first trading session since the announcement was made. During the session, the price rose to as high as 19 percent over Friday’s close.           Among the three companies, Kosdaq-listed Celltrion Pharm has the smallest market cap. Celltrion Healthcare’s stock closed the same as Friday while Celltrion’s slightly fell 1.35 percent on Monday.             “We believe establishing a holding company structure will strictly separate ownership and management, solidifying the grip of professional managers [over each affiliate]. Merging the three companies will also put development, distribution and sales under a single company — hence increasing cost efficiency and business transparency,” the bio pharmaceutical company said in a Friday statement.           Celltrion develops and produces biosimilars, the business the company is best known for. Celltrion Healthcare is the exclusive exporter of the main affiliate’s three biosimilars, now approved and sold in more than 100 countries. Celltrion Pharm is in charge of domestic sales and the group’s lower profile business of over-the-counter drugs.           The current corporate structure, in which production and sales are controlled by different entities, has raised issues. In a 2019 report from the Fair Trade Commission, Celltrion Group was showed to have raised 41.4 percent of its revenue by internal group transactions. This was the highest ratio among 59 conglomerates.            In Korea, a high ratio of internal group transactions attracts the attentions of the Fair Trade Commission and can make the company a target of investigation for depriving external suppliers business opportunities.            Local analysts generally agree that the merger would eliminate risks related to inter-group transactions and cut some costs. If the three companies combine their cash reserves it could also help fund research and development, mergers or acquisitions.             But analysts are mixed on how big the merger’s effect will be.             “As the planned merger will simply bring together development/production and distribution operations, we do not expect any strong cost reduction effects via an improved transaction structure,” Mirae Asset Daewoo analyst Kim Tae-hee wrote in a Monday report, adding that Celltrion Healthcare already has a “low back-office headcount.”             Some pointed out that the roadmap lacks relevant details to assess its future impact, like the value of the shares of each company in the merger. The plan also awaits a major obstacle: shareholder approval.          “Individual shareholders make up a large group at both Celltrion and Celltrion Healthcare, holding 62.97 percent and 52.39 percent shares,” noted Hana Financial Investment analyst Sun Min-jeong. “Their interests may greatly differ over the valuation of the merged entity. Therefore, we expect the merger of the three [Celltrion] affiliates to have many obstacles.”          BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]        "
84,"Honk against Moon this Saturday, lose your license","






     Gwanghwamun Square in Jongno District, central Seoul, is ringed with steel barricades Monday as police brace for clashes with right-wing civic groups, who promised large protests on Saturday. [NEWS1]         Seoul’s police chief Monday threatened to suspend or revoke the driver’s license of anyone who participates in a so-called car rally anywhere in the capital on Foundation Day this Saturday, as anti-Moon Jae-in activists refuse to comply with government social distancing rules.           Several right-wing civic groups have been vowing to protest the president and his administration this weekend by taking their cars out onto streets and shouting from their vehicles — a car rally. The plan came in response to the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s ban on any congregations of 10 people or more through Oct. 11 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.           The Seoul Metropolitan Government has also designated no-rally zones in several parts of downtown Seoul, including in Jongno District, where even rallies of fewer than 10 people are prohibited.             The car rally was designed to evade any chance of transmitting the virus, but the Seoul government and police claim virus transmission can still occur in the process of organizing the events — plus the fact that long lines of cars would seriously disturb traffic.           Even Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun weighed in last week, saying any participant in massive car rallies would encounter “zero tolerance” by law enforcement — and possibly get arrested or have their license revoked, or both.           Jang Ha-yeun, commissioner of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, went a step further Monday, saying stern punitive measures will be applied to any car rally protestors, including rallies of fewer than 10 cars. Before Jang’s announcement, police had allowed car rallies involving fewer than 10 cars.           In a press conference Monday, Jang said if car rally protestors refuse to follow orders from police officers to disperse three times, they will be slapped with 40 penalty points, enough to get their licenses suspended. If they cause damage to roads or disturb traffic by setting up obstacles, they will receive 100 penalty points, he said, enough to get their licenses revoked.           A large anti-Moon rally held in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, on Liberation Day on Aug. 15 has often been cited by government agencies trying to block protests in Seoul, as more than 600 coronavirus patients have been linked to that rally.                              Korea added 50 new cases of virus infections Sunday, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KCDA) announced Monday morning, the lowest day-to-day figure in 47 days. Health authorities, however, barely celebrated the drop, saying daily cases on Saturday through Tuesday tend to be lower than other days of the week because fewer people get tested over the weekend.           It normally takes about one or two days for a test result to be confirmed.           Of Sunday’s 50 new cases, 40 were local infections: 19 in Seoul, 13 in Gyeonggi, three in North Gyeongsang and one each in Busan, Incheon, Ulsan, Gangwon and North Chungcheong.             Among the rest, which were imported, two were from Uzbekistan and one each from India, Indonesia, Nepal, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, Turkey and Canada.           Five people died Sunday, raising total deaths to 406, while 44 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 21,292. As of Sunday at midnight, a total of 23,661 people have been diagnosed with the virus in Korea.             As the government investigation into faulty free flu shots continue, the KDCA said Monday that one person among 407 people across 10 metropolitans and provinces reported feeling “pain” on the skin where the needle was injected. The KDCA said no other “unusual symptoms” have been reported, and that it was unclear whether the patient received a shot that was left at room temperature.           On Sept. 22, the KDCA announced that a government project offering free flu shots to the nation’s old and young had been abruptly halted after health authorities detected problems in deliveries. Some vaccines were left at room temperature as they were being shipped instead of being refrigerated. At the time, the KDCA said the vaccines in question had not been administered to anyone.           Three days later, the KDCA backtracked on its earlier statement that the vaccines weren’t administered to anyone, saying some medical facilities claim they didn’t receive the notification not to use the flu shots and gave them to patients.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
85,Gov't to enforce new measures to protect aspiring young talent,"

     Many global talents are getting a dance lesson at Global K Center in Paju, Gyeonggi. [GLOBAL K CENTER]         The government will enforce stricter measures to protect the rights of aspiring underage talents working in the entertainment scene.           The Culture Ministry announced Monday that management agencies will have to disclose more information about their practices, such as information about the company, which entertainers it represents, as well as general information like its registration number, on the online system operated by Korea Creative Content Agency (Kocca).            The government will also crack down on any monetary demands in exchange for debut opportunities.           With the global spotlight on many Korean talents like BTS, as well as the actors and producers of the movie “Parasite,” many worry that young entertainers may be exposed to unsafe environments in which someone asks for money in exchange for air time, said the ministry.           The government will also consolidate information about upcoming auditions released through industry-related associations and groups.           It has also created a sample format of a contract specifically for underage talent, which will be updated every three years to reflect any changes seen in the industry. The ministry also vowed to protect young talents' rights to study and rest and enforce stronger measures to deal with cases of sexual harassment.           BY LEE SUN-MIN   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]   "

87,North Korea tried to rescue official: Defense Ministry,"

     A South Korean Navy vessel on Friday patrols waters near the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto maritime border with North Korea, where a fisheries official went missing last week and was later killed by a North Korean patrol. [YONHAP]               North Korean troops attempted to rescue a South Korean fisheries official stranded in their waters for hours last Tuesday before the “situation changed drastically” and resulted in the man’s killing, Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense said Monday.           According to a senior ministry official citing military intelligence, a North Korean fishing vessel discovered the official, surnamed Lee, around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday but he somehow evaded capture. The North then mounted search operations for Lee for around two hours.           “Later, the situation changed drastically and limited [Pyongyang’s] response,” the Defense Ministry official said, apparently referring to Lee’s shooting and killing by North Korean troops at around 9:40 p.m. that evening.             Lee, who was a 47-year-old civil servant at an agency under South Korea’s Oceans Ministry, went missing the previous day in waters south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea, in unexplained circumstances.           The Defense Ministry’s description that the North Koreans lost track of Lee somehow and searched for him for hours was backed up by earlier comments from the ruling Democratic Party’s Rep. Min Hong-chul, chair of the National Assembly’s National Defense Committee, on a radio program on Friday.           According to Min, who cited a military briefing, the North Koreans kept Lee under watch for three hours after his discovery Tuesday afternoon, but then lost him. They then searched for him for around two hours, and upon his second discovery, shot him on orders from superiors.           North Korean leader Kim Jong-un issued a rare apology for the shooting on Friday, contained in a message from Pyongyang's United Front Department with its description of what transpired that day.           But the North’s official account contradicted that offered by the South’s military in key details. The South said North Korean soldiers burned Lee’s body, presumably out of fear of coronavirus contagion.           According to the message Friday, North Korean troops, after shooting Lee, burned only the flotsam on which he was riding at the time of his capture.           Even more controversial, however, was the omission of any suggestion that Lee was trying to defect, which the South’s Defense Ministry said last week was the likely explanation for his enigmatic crossing into North Korean waters.           The “unidentified intruder” floating atop some material failed to respond clearly to questions about his identity from North Korean guards approximately 80 meters (260 feet) away, the United Front Department said. The man attempted to flee after two warning shots were fired, prompting soldiers to fire 10 shots at him from 40 to 50 meters away.           North Korean soldiers approached to within about 10 meters of the floating material, but the South Korean was no longer visible on top of the material, the message added.           While the United Front Department explanation suggested its troops shot the South Korean man after judging him to be an intruder rather than a potential defector, Seoul’s military said it had verified the man had expressed his intention to defect to the North Koreans.           That Lee left his shoes behind on a fisheries monitoring he disappeared from last Monday, wore a life vest and used flotsam to travel to North Korean waters also strongly indicated his intent to defect, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said.           To bolster its argument, the Defense Ministry official said Monday the military would hand over relevant intelligence to the Coast Guard after their repeated requests.           Exactly what such intelligence consists of has not been disclosed. At least some of it is believed to include a wiretap of communications between the North Korean guards who supposedly fired on Lee and their superiors, according to hints by ministry officials in earlier briefings.           As to the controversy over the discrepancy of the military’s explanation with the North’s, the Defense Ministry official said the military planned to review all information it had on the incident from the “perspective of a third party,” though no retractions were made of previous assessments.             But the deceased official’s family members — and opposition lawmakers — refuse to accept the idea he was trying to defect.             On his Facebook page Sunday, Lee’s older brother claimed the South Korean military was attempting to frame the official to cover up its own failure to detect Lee’s capture by the North Koreans in time.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

89,"Three women, one English class and a mystery to solve ","

     Actors Go Ah-sung, Park Hye-soo, Lee Som and director Lee Jong-pil pose for the camera at an online press event on Monday to promote their upcoming film ""Samjin Co. English Class."" [LOTTE ENTERTAINMENT]               As the retro trend continues to dominate Korea these days, lead actors Go Ah-sung, Lee Som and Park Hye-soo will take audiences to a corporate environment in the mid-90s in their upcoming film “Samjin Co. English Class.”           Despite being experts in terms of their working abilities after serving at a company called Samjin for eight years, the three female employees, Jayoung, Yuna and Boram, fail to win promotions due to their lack of university graduation diplomas. The film illustrates the three colleagues taking English classes together in hopes to win promotions, but while doing so they find out that the company is involved in some shady activities.             ""It's a movie based on the real-life example during the globalization craze in the mid-1990s,” director Lee Jong-pil said during an online press event held on Monday. “That’s when the companies started emphasizing the importance of learning English and opened the Test of English for International Communication (Toeic) classes for their employees. The companies gave opportunities for promotion to high school graduates, who may have remained as rank-and-file-level workers, if they passed the Toeic exam.”           ""Jayoung [played by Go Ah-sung] is an employee who wants to be a high-flying career woman, but in reality is treated like a coffee maker by her superiors,"" Go said. ""Nineteen-ninety-five is when I was only 3 years old, so I don’t have many memories myself. But to those who have experienced that period, I think Jayoung will be familiar to those female office workers in the 90s.”           Actor Lee Som plays Yuna who works in the marketing department and whose creative ideas always get stolen by her superiors. Yuna’s hobby of reading detective novels also comes in handy when the three are solving the mystery behind the company.           Boram, played by actor Park Hye-soo, is a math genius who even won the International Mathematical Olympiad and yet remains in the lowest rank after eight years serving in the accounting department.           “Boram is a key figure in uncovering suspicions related to the company's corruption by taking the mathematical approach,” Park said.           In the film, the three portray characters who experience unfair treatment that female workers in the 90s had to go through in the workplace because of their educational background. But instead of getting intimidated in such a working environment, they play ambitious women who study hard to win the opportunity to get promoted by actively taking the English class.           “The three characters with three different charms are expected to present refreshing and cheerful energy to the viewers,” director Lee said. “While solving the mystery behind the company, the three actors will portray the story of growth in one’s workplace that anyone can relate to.”           “To recreate the ways we lived in the 90s, we tried to embody the costumes, settings, makeup, and songs of the 90s,"" director Lee added.           Actors Go and Lee agreed their favorite scene was on the morning commute, which is also the scene portrayed on the film’s poster.           “That scene really put me into a time machine as if I was time traveling into the alleys of Chungmuro in central Seoul,” Go said.           ""For styling, I referenced the photos of my mother taken in the 90s,” actor Lee said. “In the movie, I look just like my mom in her youth. It felt so strange that I can't describe it in words.""           The film is set to premiere next month.           BY KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

91,Average selling price of Seoul apartments hits 1 billion won,"

     A view of apartments on the south side of the Han River from Lotte World Tower in Jamsil, southern Seoul, on Sept. 27. Despite government efforts, apartment prices continue to rise. [YONHAP]               Despite government claims that real estate prices have been stabilized, the average selling price for an apartment in Seoul exceeded 1 billion won ($852,000) for the first time in a single month.           The price of jeonse, long-term deposit rentals, also continues to rise as the result of the ruling Democratic Party’s tenant protection legislation passed in July.           According to a monthly report on real estate prices by KB Kookmin Bank on Monday, the average selling price for apartments in Seoul this month was 1.03 billion won.           That was 19.3 percent more than a year earlier, and a 27.7 percent increase compared to two years ago.           Apartment prices have been rising under the Moon Jae-in government, despite its nearly constant attempts to cool them down.           In March 2017, just two months before the administration took office, the average apartment selling price in Seoul exceeded 600 million won for the first time. It broke the 700-million-won mark a year later in March 2018. In October of the same year, it rose to 800 million won.           Last March, Seoul apartments on average were selling for 900 million won.           According to KB Kookmin Bank, even the northern neighborhoods of Seoul including Seongbuk, Nowon and Geumcheon districts have seen a significant increase in the last two years.           Geumcheon District saw the sharpest increase among apartments in Seoul in the last two years, rising nearly 40 percent.           Other neighborhoods on the north side of the Han River have seen rises of more than 30 percent including Nowon, which rose 39.3 percent year-on-year, as well as Jungnang and Gangbuk districts, which were both up 37 percent.             Increases in the fancy neighborhoods on the south side of the Han River, which were the prime target of government cooling off measures, were less precipitous because they were already high.           Selling prices in Seocho District in the last two years rose 17.9 percent while in Gangnam they rose 18.3 percent.           Gangnam District remains the most expensive neighborhood.           An 85-square-meter (915-square-foot) apartment's average selling price this month was 1.82 billion won. Seocho trailed behind with an average selling price of 1.57 billion won for a same-sized apartment, with Songpa coming in third with 1.27 billion won.           Geumcheon District was the lowest with the same-sized apartment selling for an average of 604.2 million won.           Jeonse prices also continued to rise. The average jeonse price in Seoul this month was 517 million won. Average jeonse prices exceeded 500 million won for the first time in August.           In the 11 districts on the south side of the Han River, the average jeonse price was 603 million won, breaking the 600-million-won mark for the first time. For the 14 districts on the north side of the Han River, the average jeonse price was 420 million won. Average jeonse prices on the north side of the river exceeded 400 million won for the first time in July.           The most expensive jeonse contracts were in Gangnam District, where an 85-square-meter apartment averaged 872 million won. Seocho District trailed behind with 780 million won and Songpa District with 625 million won.             The cheapest was found in Dobong District, where an 85-square-meter apartment's jeonse averaged 325 million won. Geumcheon was the second cheapest at 349.5 million won while Nowon jeonse averaged 355 million won.           In the last couple of weeks, government officials including Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki and Land Minister Kim Hyun-mee have stressed that the real estate market was stabilizing citing the Korea Appraisal Board’s weekly housing and jeonse price assessment.           During a government meeting on real estate measures last week, Hong stressed that the buying frenzy in Seoul has been on a decline.             “What we should take notice of is that the purchasing sentiment that precedes the housing market price increases has started to ease,” Hong said.           Land Minister Kim at the National Assembly as well as in a radio appearance repeatedly stressed that real estate prices in Seoul have been stabilizing since July.           However, Kim was plunged into controversy when she said in late August it was her first time looking at the Korea Appraisal Board’s statistics on the real transaction index, average transaction prices and the median transaction prices presented by a lawmaker from the opposition People Power Party during a National Assembly hearing.           She was accused of cherry-picking statistics from the Korea Appraisal Board.           The Moon government has so far introduced 23 sets of real estate measures to cool off the market since 2017.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

93,New legislation on online shopping proposed by FTC,"

     Parcels are loaded on trucks at a logistics center in Seoul on Sept. 13. [NEWS1]               The antitrust agency announced new legislation to make online retail more accountable after online transactions surged during the global coronavirus pandemic.          Some worry about excessive regulation of online shopping, which already have to comply with the Fair Transaction in Large Retail Business Act as well as the Electronic Transactions Act.             According to the Fair Trade Commission, the government-proposed legislation will affect companies with annual revenue exceeding 1 billion won ($852,000) and who mediate transactions between merchants and customers worth at least 100 billion won.            The new legislation is expected to affect leading big online search engines such as Naver and Google, e-commerce platforms like Coupang and online delivery platforms like Baedal Minjok (Baemin).             While the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) did not name the companies that would be affected, it said at least eight e-commerce platforms, two lodging platforms and at least four food delivery platforms will be subjected to the enhanced accountability.           Some 1.4 million merchants sell products and services via online platforms.           Under the legislation, a contract between an online platform and a merchant must have 14 points of agreement on things like rates of commission, the contract period and detailed terms for cancelation of the contract.           The online platform operator has to alert a merchant to changes to a contract at least 15 days in advance. If the operator plans to suspend a service, it has to warn the merchant seven days in advance. If it plans to shut down a service permanently, it needs to warn the merchant 30 days earlier.           Platform operators that violate the law will face fines that are double the amount of the violation. The maximum fine is 1 billion won.             The antitrust agency said it will actively encourage online platform operators to commit to voluntary changes to unfair business practices like raising commissions or forcing merchants to charge the same service charges on all online platforms.           In June, Apple agreed to change a business practice that charged Korean telecommunication companies for marketing and repair costs.            FTC Chairwoman Joh Sung-wook said the agency hopes companies will adopt fairer business practices ahead of legislation.           The bill will be sent to the National Assembly after a legislative notice period ends in November. The FTC hopes it will pass in the first half of next year.           The FTC said it was speeding up the legislation after a surge in online shopping due to the coronavirus pandemic.           According to the government, online shopping has been growing at a fast rate: from 25.2 trillion won in 2010 to 135.3 trillion won in 2019. In the first half of 2020, online shopping purchases  amounted to 74.3 trillion won.           Online shopping in July hit a monthly record of almost 13 trillion won, 15 percent more than a year earlier.           That figure is expected to rise in August due to the government's toughened social distancing measures.             If the legislation passes the National Assembly, it will likely go into effect in the first half of next year.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
94,"No wrongdoing by Choo or family, prosecutors find","

                           Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae arrives at work on Monday. [NEWS1]               The prosecution on Monday cleared Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae of allegations that she had abused her power to arrange special treatment for her son while he was serving the military in 2017.             The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office announced Monday it found no grounds on which to indict Choo, her son or her former aide after a monthslong probe into the allegations.             Choo and her family have been battling accusations that her son, surnamed Seo, had received special treatment when he was serving in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, from November 2016 through August 2018. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).             Several whistle-blowers have alleged that Seo was let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of his sick leave in June 2017, which had already been extended once. Choo was accused of using her influence to get a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days.             Choo and Seo consistently denied the accusations. After a criminal complaint was filed in January, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office investigated the case for eight months.             ""We do not see any deception or outside pressure involved in the process of Seo's applying and using medical leave days,"" the prosecution said. ""He did not return to the base [after the first extension expired] because the application for using his personal vacation days was granted. Therefore, we cannot press an AWOL charge against him.""             The prosecution said Seo's initial application for medical leave, the first extension and the subsequent use of personal days were all approved by the regional commander. ""Seo was informed verbally about the approvals, and we do not see a purpose for Seo to go AWOL,"" the prosecution said.             The prosecution added that Seo had asked Choo's aide to inquire the military about the extension, not his parents.             The prosecution also dismissed the suspicion that Choo or her husband had asked the Ministry of National Defense to arrange the extension. Although a document purported to be a military record created by Seo's commander on June 15, 2017 said that Seo's parents had made a request to the ministry, the prosecution said it failed to find any record from the ministry to corroborate it.             The prosecution also said it found no evidence that Choo had made any improper orders to her aide to arrange the extension.             While dropping all charges against Choo, her son and her former aide, the prosecutors asked the Army's prosecution to conclude the probe for two incumbent military officers who were involved in the scandal.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "
95,Kakao Pay aims to go public in the first half of next year,"

     Kakao Pay company logo. [KAKAO PAY]               Kakao’s mobile payment service Kakao Pay is preparing to go public by the first half of next year confirmed the company's spokesperson on Monday.           Kakao Pay reportedly submitted an application to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to receive audits ahead of preliminary approval. The mobile payment service will be the second member of the Kakao family, after Kakao Games, to go public.           The underwriter for Kakao Pay’s initial public offering (IPO) is KB Securities. The company did not give any details on exactly when it will start trading on the local stock market.           The mobile payment service said it qualifies for both the Kospi and the Kosdaq market, but is undecided over which it will go public on.           “While there could be many variables including the situation in the stock market, we are preparing for an IPO. We hope to secure a new growth engine through public funding and aggressively grow our businesses,” said an official statement from the company.           Kakao Pay is currently the most used mobile payment service in Korea. It has around 34 million users contributing to more than 70 trillion won ($60 billion) of transactions this year, according to a report by Shinyoung Securities.           Its second-largest shareholder is Chinese Ant Financial, the operator of Alipay, which has a 43.9 percent stake in the company. Alipay Singapore Holdings invested 230 billion won in the company when it first came out in 2017 and made an additional investment of 115 billion won in June. The biggest shareholder is Kakao, which owns 56.1 percent.           The company holds multiple financial businesses under its belt. Kakao Pay acquired Baro Investment & Securities this year and launched a brokerage subsidiary to sell investment products and provide asset management services. It’s also soon to open an online-only insurance company.           “Kakao Pay is currently valued at 7 trillion won among analysts. The company seems to be rushing for an IPO in an attempt to expand its financial business. It will definitely affect other mobile payment services like Toss and NHN Payco,” said analyst Yun Eul-jeong from Shinyoung Securities.           “Whether it will have an impact on commercial banks is hard to know, since the company is smaller in size and closer to an internet platform than a financial institution.”           More affiliates of Kakao are waiting in line to be traded publicly. Kakao’s online-only bank Kakao Bank announced on Sept. 23 that it would push for a public offering this year.           Shares of Kakao rose 4.98 percent or 17,500 won following the IPO announcement.            BY KANG JAE-EUN  [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleKakao Bank to start preparing to go publicKakao Games makes a splash on first day of tradeKakao Pay Securities targets younger investors"

                  Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur is expected to take a short break due to injury.           During the Spurs Premier League match against Newcastle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday, Son once again started the match but was substituted after the first half of the match, while Spurs had a 1-0 lead. Lucas Moura scored the opener in the 25th minute of the game, but Newcastle fought back until the very end with Callum Wilson equalizing in the 97th minute.              Son Heung-min [EPA/yonhap               Although Son wasn’t able to continue his hot streak, during his time on the field he made two goal attempts — in the 30th and 42nd minutes — but both shots hit the post.           Despite initial assumptions that Spurs’ head coach José Mourinho pulled Son out of the game to save him for upcoming fixtures, it was reported after the match that Son was injured.           “It’s an injury,” Mourinho was quoted as saying on Skysports.com after the match. “We’ll have him out for a while. It’s his hamstring.”           With a 1-1 draw, Spurs are ranked seventh with a win, a draw and a loss, totaling four points for this season.           Son is expected to miss a number of Spurs matches including the London club’s EFL Cup match against Chelsea on Tuesday and their Europa League playoff match against Maccabi Haifa on Thursday.           Son was off to probably a career best start to the season. Following a series of successful friendly matches, Son started his season strong by scoring four goals during a Premier League match against Southampton on Sept. 20.           Since Spurs started off their 2020-21 Premier League season with a 1-0 loss to Everton, Son was the first player this season to score for Spurs and became the first-ever Korean footballer to score a hat-trick in a Premier League match. As if that wasn't enough, he became the first-ever Asian footballer to score four goals in a single match.           Following that historic match, Son continued his scoring streak during Spurs’ third-round qualifying match against Shkendija in the UEFA Europa League on Sept. 24. In addition to another goal, Son managed to add two assists during that match.           Son’s absence is expected to be a huge blow for Spurs as he and teammate Harry Kane have proven a lethal pairing so far this season.            BY KANG YOO-RIM  [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
97,Soaring iron ore prices batter Korea's steelmakers,"

     Hyundai Steel's cold-rolled steel. [HYUNDAI STEEL]               The price of iron ore, the key ingredient for steelmaking, reached its highest level in more than six years this month, surpassing $130 per ton.           On top of that, the decreased price of products from Japanese competitors has further raised the pressure on domestic steel companies still struggling to overcome sluggish demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic.                            According to data from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and Korea Resources Corporation, the price of iron ore from China’s Qingdao port as of Sept. 14 was $130.17 per ton — the highest in six and a half years. The price had inched down since to $124.26 per ton as of Sept. 25, but the recent price of iron ore is still much higher than the $80 range in February.             The price fluctuation of iron ore tracks China’s economy, which started to bounce back in the second quarter following the disruptions caused by the country's initial coronavirus outbreak.             China, which produces more than half of the world’s iron ore, was also the world's largest importer of the commodity in July, as its construction and manufacturing industries rebounded. China's iron ore imports in that month jumped 10.8 percent from the previous month to a record high.           Market watchers forecast the price of iron ore to remain in the $120 range per ton throughout the year on the increased demand.               Increase in steel product prices      Following the rising price of iron ore, domestic steelmakers including Posco and Hyundai Steel raised the retail price of steel.           Earlier this month, Posco, the world’s fifth largest steelmaker by output, raised the retail price of hot-rolled coil by 50,000 won ($43) per ton, and cold-rolled steel by 20,000 won to 40,000 won per ton, depending on the types of products.           Similarly, Hyundai Steel recently raised its retail price of hot-rolled coil by 50,000 won per ton and cold-rolled steel by 60,000 won. The second largest steelmaker in Korea after Posco, it also raised the price of steel plates by 30,000 won per ton.             Steelmakers have been attempting to reflect the increased price of iron ore to their major suppliers, including automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors.           Hyundai Steel said it hasn’t yet reached an agreement with them.           “We are still negotiating, and nothing has been concluded,” said Lee Jeong-hwa, a spokesperson for Hyundai Steel.             Posco refused to comment on the matter.               Cheaper imports from Japan          Meanwhile, Japanese competitors are driving prices down for local steelmakers with cheaper H-beams, which are commonly used in the construction of buildings, trailers, bridges and others.           According to data from the Korea Iron & Steel Association, Korea’s H-beam imports from January through August totaled 271,871 tons, down 24.2 percent on year.            Imports from Japan rose 55.1 percent on year during the same period to 114,835 tons. They accounted for 42 percent of the total imports to Korea, which is a large jump compared to 2017 through 2019 when Japanese imports only accounted for around 13 to 22 percent.            “The price of Japanese steel products used to be more expensive than that of domestic steelmakers. But due to the difficulties from the Covid-19, Japanese steelmakers exported the products to Korea at a cheaper price. The price was lower than that from domestic steelmakers.” Lee said.           She added that iron ore prices, Japanese competition and the overall sluggish demand for steel products due to reduced production of automobiles and construction projects have all contributed to difficulties for the steel industry.               Outlook          Market watchers believe steelmakers will see higher earnings in the third quarter than in the previous quarter on the recovery of the manufacturing businesses.           In the second quarter, Posco reported its first quarterly operating loss while Hyundai Steel saw its on-year operating profit drop 94 percent.             Analyst Baek Jae-seung from Samsung Securities pointed out that the increased retail price of steel products has likely raised steelmakers’ performance in the third quarter.             “The retail price of steel in China, which has most rapidly recovered from the impact of Covid-19, is rising rapidly, along with that from the United States and Europe, helped by the production control and recovery in demand,” Baek wrote in a report published last week.            But he said it's unclear when inflation will be reflected on steel prices, along with the recovery of the real economy.           “Although China is leading the recovery of the steel industry, that isn’t enough [for steelmakers] to make up for the rise of the iron ore price,"" Byun Jong-man, an analyst with NH Investment & Securities, said. ""The cost burden is projected to grow bigger in the fourth quarter due to the skyrocketing iron ore price,” Byun added.           According to a report from KB Securities, Posco is projected to report 13.78 trillion won in sales, down 13.8 percent on year, and 478.1 billion won in operating profit, down 54 percent on year in the third quarter. Another report from KB Securities showed Hyundai Steel estimated to report 4.36 trillion won in sales, down 13.6 percent on year, and 35 billion won in operating profit, up 2.7 percent on year.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticlePosco broadens its online selling of steel productsHyundai Steel defies the odds to turn a profit in Q2Hyundai Steel halts production at Dangjin electric arc furnace"
98,Moon calls for restoring communications with the North after killing at sea,"

     President Moon Jae-in hosts a meeting with senior presidential secretaries on Monday at the Blue House.  [YONHAP]                President Moon Jae-in on Monday urged North Korea to restore its severed military communication lines to maintain emergency communications following last week's shooting death of a South Korean fisheries official by soldiers in the North.             ""I offer my deep condolences to the victim's family, regardless of how he ended up in the North Korean waters,"" Moon said in a meeting with his senior secretaries on Monday. ""I can imagine the shock and rage of the people. No matter what happened, the government, responsible for protecting the people's lives and safety, offers an apology.""             It was Moon's first time directly addressing the North's killing of the 47-year-old official, who had been employed by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries' West Sea Fisheries Management Service at the time that he disappeared from a boat in waters near the maritime border. Moon issued a message through his spokesman on Thursday, but did not mention it in a public event, including his speech at the Armed Forces Day ceremony on Friday.             According to Seoul's Ministry of National Defense, the official, who went missing on Monday, was shot and killed by officials aboard the North's patrol boat on Sept. 22. They also burned his body and discarded his remains in the Yellow Sea, the ministry said, prompting public outrage in the South.             On Monday, Moon said it was promising that the North has quickly responded to the South's demand for an explanation, calling it a sign that Pyongyang may avoid any further escalation of tensions.             ""I particularly attach a special meaning that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent a message of a sincere apology to our people,"" Moon said. ""It is unprecedented that the North's highest leader made a direct and immediate apology. Kim is taking this incident very seriously, and I can see that he doesn't want inter-Korean relations to collapse.""             Moon said the two Koreans should resume dialogue and cooperation. He also said military communications between the two Koreas should be restored to prevent possible military conflicts and unexpected incidents.           ""If communications are restored, the two Koreas can easily cooperate for rescue missions when the people of the two Koreas or ships are adrift,"" Moon said. ""I request that the North restore at least the military communication lines and resume their operation.""             It remains to be seen if the North will accept Moon's proposal and reconnect the severed military communication lines. Complaining about the South Korean activists' dispatch of anti-Pyongyang leaflets over the summer, the North shut down all inter-Korean communication channels, including military hotlines and contacts at the truce village of Panmunjom, in June.             In the aftermath of the tragedy, the Blue House revealed that Moon and Kim are maintaining contact, and had exchanged letters earlier this month. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) also received a message from the North on Friday, indicating that communication between the two Koreas is still alive.             ""I expect this tragedy will create an opportunity for talks and cooperation and advance inter-Korean relations,"" Moon said.           Meanwhile, political confrontations between the ruling and opposition lawmakers continued Monday, as the ruling party insisted on adopting controversial resolutions promoting cooperation with North Korea.             At the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee's meeting in the morning on Monday, two resolutions sponsored by the ruling Democratic Party (DP) were introduced for deliberation.             One calls for the two Koreas, China and the United States to declare a formal end to the Korean War. The other was a resolution to urge the South Korean government to allow individual tours to the North.             The first resolution was sponsored by Rep. Kim Kyung-hyup of the DP in June and the latter was sponsored by DP Rep. Kang Byung-won in August. They were automatically introduced to the committee following the mandatory 50-day review period.             Opposition lawmakers refused to discuss the resolutions, citing the sensitivity of the timing, but DP representatives said they want to pass them.             ""Our citizen was shot and killed, but you really want to declare the end of the war and resume a tourism project as if nothing happened?"" Rep. Kim Seok-ki of the PPP said.             Following heated debates, the two resolutions were handed over to the Agenda Coordination Committee. The committee, comprising equal numbers of lawmakers from both parties, will review the controversial agendas for up to 90 days.             The DP and PPP also bickered over a resolution to condemn the North for killing the South Korean official. Although they unified last week to issue a strongly worded resolution to denounce the North, the DP shifted its stance after the North's apology.             As the public rage mounted over the North's killing and apparent burning of the victim's body at sea, the Assembly's National Defense Committee passed a new resolution condemning the North on Thursday.           The DP's floor leader, Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon, vowed to work with the opposition to pass it during the upcoming plenary session.           ""I strongly demand that the North apologize to the South Korean people and victim, and punish those responsible,"" Kim said Friday morning.             The DP's stance, however, changed later in the day after the North sent a message and offered an apology. The DP, which controls the majority, said Sunday it won't cooperate with the opposition to pass the resolution.             The DP and the PPP negotiated on Monday, but failed to reach an agreement. The DP said it had planned to cooperate on the resolution by holding a voting session later in the day, but the PPP issued a new demand, calling for a hearing on Oct. 6 to question the government officials about the incident. The DP said it had withdrawn its support for the resolution because it does not want the hearing.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

[GM KOREA]               YEONGJONG, Incheon — Muddy puddles, steep hills and rocky streams were not enough to stop Chevrolet's new Colorado pickup truck from barging through an artificial off-road course set up at Oseong Mountain on Yeongjong Island, Incheon.           With the camping craze in full swing in Korea, the launch of this partially revamped version of the Colorado pickup truck seems to be very timely.           GM Korea brought the new version to Korea just one year after it debuted the American pickup truck here for the first time in 2019.           While there was some skepticism over how well the pickup truck would appeal to Korean customers who have generally preferred luxurious sedans and more recently sports utility vehicles, Colorado’s sales figures actually exceeded expectations.           It sold 3,078 units in the first half of this year, making it the fifth most sold model in Korea’s imported car market after the Mercedes-Benz E-Class 300 4MATIC, E-Class e250, Volkswagen’s Tiguan and Ford’s Explorer.           The face-lifted version came with a redesigned black grille and a larger bumper to emphasize the strong demeanor of the truck. The rear is now engraved with ""Chevrolet.""           The new Colorado also has a new trim called Z71-X, a premium trim in the lineup that comes with a few design features like a black bowtie emblem and Z71 badge on the grille.           Function-wise, it comes with options like Hill Decent Control that helps the car to safely descend on steep hills and Transfer Case Shield, which protects the powertrain on bumpy roads.           To check out what this vehicle is capable of, the Korea JoongAng Daily got behind the wheel of the Z71-X trim last week.           The courses were driven on auto mode, instead of testing the car's more specific driving modes, in order to test the most basic functions of the vehicle's off-road performance.           At speeds slower than 30 kilometers (19 miles) per hour, the car navigated through deep and thick muddy puddles without slipping or sinking. It was also able to cross a river with water easily reaching the car's bumper. According to Chevrolet, it can drive through water up to 80 centimeters (31 inches) deep.                Chevrolet's face-lifted Colorado pickup truck launches in Korea. [GM KOREA]               Driving down a 35-degree hill in the Colorado really feels like driving off a cliff as the road is not visible from the driver's point of view. With the help of the Z71-X's Hill Decent Control, however, the car controlled its speed on its own without the driver having to press the brake and reached flat ground safely.           Driving a course with deep pits and bumps was similarly safe and stable. With the help of the mechanical locking differential system, the vehicle adequately distributed power to the wheels that needed the most resistance.           The course also included a section towing a 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) caravan. The screen on the center console provided a rear view when necessary to check on the caravan. Chevrolet said the Colorado has the capacity to tow a caravan that weighs as much a 3.2 tons.           Despite its obvious off-road credentials, the Colorado still holds its own on paved roads. The relatively heavy handling could be seen as a plus for those who enjoy a more stable ride. Mixed in among all the river-fording and cliff-climbing features is a basic driver assistant system, which warns the driver through the head-up display if the car is about to collide with an object or is veering out of its lane.           There are hardly any rivals to the Colorado in Korea, with the one exception of SsangYong Motor's Rexton Sports. The model launched in 2018 and has been selling more than 40,000 units each year. In the first half of this year, however, it sold 15,781 units, down 27 percent compared to the same period last year.           The new Colorado's price starts from 38.3 million won ($32,600). The Z71-X trim starts at 44.9 million won.           SsangYong's Rexton Sports starts at 24.1 million won.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "
103,Turning a top Esports franchise into a successful business,"

     John Kim, COO of T1, poses for a photo in his office at T1's headquarters in Gangnam, southern Seoul on Sept. 2. [PARK SANG-MOON]               It may have only been a year since John Kim joined T1, but the Esports team's chief operating officer (COO) is already thinking global.           Kim started his career as the founder of TSB Communications in Vancouver, before moving more firmly into Esports as founder and advisor of an Overwatch team. While Kim is no stranger to gaming himself, he decided to focus more on the business side of the industry to cement T1's legacy.           Founded in 2003, T1 already has quite the legacy. The organization originally earned its stripes in the Starcraft world, winning numerous world championships in the popular game.           For years, T1 operated under the sports marketing arm of SK Telecom. It wasn't until last year that T1 in its current format came into existence, after the old Esports teams were rolled into a new joint venture under SK Telecom and Comcast Spectacor in 2019. At the helm of that new venture are CEO Joe Marsh and Kim.          While the players have competed in and won numerous titles to continue the team’s legacy, Kim had been working around the clock to build T1 on the business operation side.            As the joint venture is still less than a year old, Kim considers his company a start-up. T1 may have already cemented its legacy in Korea long before the current iteration came into existence, but Kim is thinking bigger.            The Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with Kim to discuss the history of T1 and its goals moving forward.                Q. Tell us a bit about T1. You mentioned the organization started earning its recognition with Starcraft, but people seem to be a lot more familiar with T1’s League of Legends team. Can you tell us about it?        A. We won three world championships and we won two other global championships. That aside, we’ve won nine regional titles within Korea. We are by far the most successful organization in Esports in the world.            Before, [the team] was part of SK Telecom's sports marketing division, [and we were] just a division branch of them, like part of their team. Then last October, we embarked on a joint venture with Comcast and SK Telecom to create a new company called T1. That’s sort of how we’ve come along until now.            Of course we have sort of the greatest player of all time, named Faker. He’s considered the best player in all of Esports. He was there for all those titles I’ve mentioned. He continues to be great. He started at a young age and to this day, he is still considered to be one of the top. That’s really hard to do. So we have him.            We were kind of founded by a guy named BoxeR, Lim Yo-hwan. He’s considered the godfather of Esports. He’s the first celebrity star Esports player. He also hails from T1. He was one of our first signings when we first started.                Q. As COO of T1, what does your role look like?          A. Like I mentioned with the joint venture, [T1] became its own independent standalone company [in] October, so it hasn’t been that long. A lot of what I do is establishing that standalone business, an actual company. That’s a lot of work.            Besides that, [I] run the operations here in Korea. We have several amazing teams. We have a business division, operations that takes care of this new headquarters. We have a cafeteria that they run, we have all the sports teams. We have amazing managers who take care of these players and make sure they get their support. And we have an amazing content team. I kind of oversee all that in Korea and focus also on business development.               Q. Some traditional sports fans still see Esports as just computer gaming. How did you get into the field?          A. I always loved video games when I was younger, playing on the Nintendo with games like Street Fighter and 007. But I describe myself as an entrepreneur. I had [my] own company in Vancouver, ran it for about 10 years and was looking for new areas to invest in. Esports, at that time around 2014, was on the rise. It was one of those areas people thought would be a growing market in the future, and it has been.            So I invested — I purchased a team here in Korea. I started a small media company focusing on Esports and gaming. I started a technology company, sort of artificial intelligence [AI]. Through that I took over an Overwatch team — there was a new franchise league by Blizzard based on a game called Overwatch. I had a team there in Korea. Through that, I got connected to a guy name Tucker Roberts, who has an actual team in that franchise, the Philadelphia Fusion.            Of course Comcast Spectacor was the parent company of his organization. Whenever they came to Korea, I showed them around, got to know Joe [Marsh], at that time the chief business officer. Now he’s the CEO of T1. When the joint venture came up, they asked me to take over the Korean operation. That’s how I got into this job.               Q. Do you play League of Legends?          A. Yes I do. For research purposes, yes I do. I actually didn’t play for a long time when I was running my business [because] it’s so crazy and busy and hectic, I just didn’t have time. But I always loved video games. I played Starcraft a lot when I was younger. When I took over the Overwatch team, I started getting back into PC gaming.                Q. As the COO of T1, do you get lessons from the players?          A. I've played Overwatch with some of the pros before. You've got to be careful though. When you play together online, it could look like they are boosting you or carrying you up. So that’s not good in a competitive team. But I have played with the pros on an Overwatch team [before]. It’s really fun.         T1’s League of Legends team poses for a photo at the 2020 LCK Sumer League at the LoL Park — LCK Arena in central Seoul. [OFFICIAL RIOT KOREAN FLICKR]                   Q. Would you say the front office work in an Esports team is different from other sports?        A. We are essentially like a start-up. We are still new, getting everything established. Esports is also new, but there are parallels to other sports. There are similarities like sponsorship, media rights and that sort of thing. But we do have to really innovate and find new business opportunities. So there are those parallels.            But Esports in general, it’s right now mostly an online sort of model — streaming. So there are differences for sure, and similarities. But in our specific case, because we’re all so new, we’re running all over the place. I'd say we are less established than tradition sports organizations.                Q. Does your schedule change on game days?        A. We’re always a little nervous on game days. We’re always eagerly anticipating and watching [games] together. But you know, it’s just a kind of day in the office. Our days get a little longer because the games go late into the night sometimes. But the front office doesn’t usually get involved in the day-to-day, with the particular head coach or coaches [taking care of] the team. We just get updates. That sort of thing.                Q. As COO, how much would you say you are involved in player scouting?         A. There are scenarios where we are very involved. We are involved to a certain extent. I mean last year, when we began the joint venture, we were kind of in a situation where we didn’t have a head coach. It all depends on what contracts are expiring. Last year, the CEO and I were actually running around, trying to sign people. We do get involved in the signing, but after the signing, we usually don’t get as involved.                Q. Speaking of signing, there are always headlines over whether Faker will re-sign with T1 or not. He’s been with the team since its beginning and has now become a part owner of the company. How did you guys manage to retain Faker for such a long period of time?        A. He is T1. He embodies T1, all the values. He’s won all the championships with it so we feel it's important that he gets a share of a company he built. That also, from a business perspective, keeps him connected to the company for a long time. He’s very important to us. Once we started working, one of our first subjects was to sign him and bring him into the company and ownership.                Q. How do people go from being a normal computer gamer to a pro? How does it generally work?        A. I’d say it is similar to sports. There are casual people playing basketball that love it. But there is that top-tier who is phenomenal at these games. There are, I think, 10 million daily active users who play League of Legends and a very, very small percentage is at the top. An even smaller percentage gets to join T1. So I guess you just have to have that talent and ability. After that, it takes a lot of practice and discipline.                Q. What is the most important skill T1 looks at when scouting players?        A. Excellence in the game is just straightforward. Most of these games have this competitive ranking system. You can see who is ranked near the top. Sometimes those players are not on the pro teams yet. That’s one way, we call it the ladder. To scout them directly off the ladder and through statistics and data, it all shows.            One of our players, Cuzz has been on top of the ladder twice and runner-up one time as well. That is one way we can initially pinpoint who we want to look into. Another way is in terms of character, I think just relentlessness. Just not giving up and always trying to get better. I think that’s a good characteristic in everybody.               Q. What was the most unforgettable moment in your career with T1?        A. I’ve been part of T1 since last May, so it hasn’t been that long. But in that period of time, we’ve won three regional titles. I’d say our last spring title, here in [the League of Legends Champions Korea] was the most special for me. That was our first title as a fully independent T1. We lost a sort of legendary coach. He went over to China. We lost several of our top players at the time. And there were some criticisms about losing these players. To win the spring title, it felt really good doing that.                Q. What was the proudest moment for you as COO?        A. From the game performance side, when we won the spring split, that felt good. A lot of the players Joe and I personally signed [were on the team].            From the operation standpoint, just putting together an amazing team that we have here. I believe we have the best Esports employees in the world. Our content team is phenomenal. Even from a viewership standpoint, there’re killing it. They’re getting amazing results. We have an amazing streaming program. That’s improving.            We have an amazing business team and we’ve solidified relationships with Nike, Samsung, BMW and other premium partners. Putting together an amazing team here is what I’m most proud of.         Q. So what’s next?        A. One of our jobs, as a business, is to make money. That’s something that I don’t think Esports teams have done well so far and they’re still trying to figure out. There is a question mark out there over how that happens. We are working really hard to find a formula for that. We have a lot of new exciting projects that are coming out.            I can’t share everything, but there is a lot. We’re like a start-up. Everybody loves their job. We have to tell people to go home — they’re here late at night. But we have a lot of cool things coming up.    One thing we did was launch a membership program for our fans through YouTube. That was quite successful. We are testing that out. We’ll continue to find ways to grow T1’s fan base and expand outside of Korea as well as go international.            BY KANG YOO-RIM  [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
104,Law firm Shin & Kim announces new recruits,"

     Sunny Kim, the new leader of law firm Shin & Kim's international tax practice team [SHIN & KIM]         Law firm Shin & Kim vowed to strengthen its international tax practice with four new recruits, including a new team leader.           The law firm, based in Jongno District, central Seoul, announced in a press release last Wednesday that Sunny Kim, a senior foreign attorney who previously served as chair of the International Taxation Subcommittee of the Legislation Committee within the Ministry of Economy and Finance, has been chosen to lead its International Tax Practice Team.            Kim’s areas of focus are international tax and cross-border M&A, with a key focus on structuring of transactions and optimization of effective tax rates, the law firm said in an English-language press release. Kim received her master's of law from New York University, an M.B.A. from Yonsei University and Ph.D. in taxation from Seoul National University.           Ellen Go, a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (Aicpa), joined Shin & Kim from Samil PwC, where she was “an integral part” of the tax consulting business with a focus on providing advice on transfer pricing and tax examination, said the law firm. Go graduated from the Leventhal School of Accounting at the University of Southern California.           Michelle Kim, a foreign attorney, worked at Deloitte Korea for five years before joining Shin & Kim, and received her J.D. equivalent from Handong International Law School. Shin & Kim highlighted her cross-border tax consulting experience and capabilities.             Baik Sae-bom, a Korean attorney, worked four years at another law firm’s tax practice team before moving to Shin & Kim, who highlighted her expertise and diverse range of knowledge in Korean tax matters. Baik graduated from the Korea University School of Law.           “They add increased depth to our tax, M&A, real estate, asset management and banking and finance practices, with all four new hires having either led or played key roles in many high-profile and complex cross-border transactions,” Kim Doo-sik, Shin & Kim’s managing partner, said in a statement.             Noting that all four new recruits have professional proficiency in both English and Korean, Kim continued that he expects them to be a great asset to the law firm.           “Together and individually, they have diverse experiences and a wealth of knowledge, which provides a fantastic platform for our international tax practice.”           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]         "

107,Tada tries again with new taxi ride-hailing service,"

                   After a legislative reform forced Tada to halt its popular van-hailing service, the company is hoping for a comeback after obtaining a government license to restart its business.          This time it won’t be vans, which Tada had previously used as a loophole in the law that previously banned ride-hailing services. The new Tada vehicles will be sedans, like normal taxis.          Tada's service operator VCNC announced Monday that it obtained the government permit to operate franchise taxis, meaning it can partner with existing taxi companies to offer a mobile platform that connects drivers to customers. The taxis will have Tada's logo displayed on the vehicle.           The plan would give partner taxis access to Tada's IT technology and brand in exchange for commission fees. Kakao Mobility’s Kakao T Blue and KST Mobility’s Macaron Taxi are the two dominant service operators in this segment.             The “Tada Light” sedan taxis will start operation this year in Seoul and Busan, the company said.           VCNC shuttered its van-hailing “Tada Basic” service in April this year after the domestic transportation law was reformed to ban renting out 11-passenger vehicles with a driver. That effectively closed a legal loophole through which the van hailing service had been able to operate without a government license since its launch in October 2018.           For the company, the legislation was a major defeat after more than a year of fierce lobbying by both Tada and, on the other side, the taxi industry.           Since then, the company has been operating vans for airport pick-ups and “Tada Premium” sedans, which directly hires government-licensed taxi drivers that fulfill certain qualifications. Tada Premium, however, can receive customers solely on reservations and cannot pick them up from the streets.           Ironically, Tada's latest move to turn into a franchise taxi operator was partly motivated by the request of taxi companies, which had fiercely opposed Tada's earlier business model, but has since been won over by the company’s IT and management capabilities.           The advent of a new taxi app, particularly with Tada’s brand value, can be an advantage for existing taxi companies as well. Consumption patterns have significantly changed, with domestic users increasingly using apps to hail cabs, along with an overall drop in demand during the coronavirus pandemic.           VCNC also said it is preparing to file for a “regulatory sandbox” regarding a taxi meter app based on GPS.          “We intend to launch many other relevant services that can support a safe and comfortable ride for our users,” said VCNC CEO Jae-uk.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr ]  "

He will meet with Prime Minister Stefan Lofven on Tuesday.           “I am very pleased to welcome my esteemed fellow Speaker Park to Stockholm,” said Speaker Norlen, according to the Swedish Embassy in Seoul. “There are strong ties between the Republic of Korea and Sweden and we have many issues of common interest to discuss.”           Park also plans to meet Kent Harstedt, Sweden's special envoy for the Korean Peninsula, and Swedish Ambassador to North Korea Joachim Bergstrom.           In Germany, Park will meet with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier; Wolfgang Schauble, head of the Bundestag, the German parliament's lower house; and Dietmar Woidke, the head of the Bundesrat, the parliament's upper house.           “Topics on the table for discussion include Germany’s unification experience and the inter-Korean relations,” Park’s office said.             It will be the first time in five years that the Assembly speaker visits Germany, and the first time that they meet both the president and the heads of the parliament in one trip.           “Park will also ask both nations for their support for Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee's campaign for director-general position of the World Trade Organization [WTO],” Park’s office said.             Park had originally also planned to visit the Czech Republic to discuss bilateral cooperation on nuclear power plants, but the trip has been delayed per Czech's request, the office said, due to their Covid-19 situation.             BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         "

Some popular camping sites by the Han River will remain off limits and all restaurants and cafes will be asked to maintain at least a 1-meter (3.3-foot) distance between each table.             Unlike the previous Level 2 measures, however, public institutes such as museums and libraries will be open, the city government said, but they will be restricted to half their attendance capacity.             The restrictions, which have been extended in various forms several times since a recent surge in new coronavirus cases, had been scheduled to expire Sunday night.             The Health Ministry said Friday that the entire country will be subject to many of the same restrictions as the Level 2 system from Sept. 28 through Oct. 11 to prevent the spread of the virus during the Chuseok holidays.           Chuseok, or Korea’s Thanksgiving holiday, is usually a time for family gatherings. Concerned with the possibility of putting elderly parents at risk, some people are opting to take vacation somewhere else in the country.           “Our parents told us not to come see them this time,” a 28-year-old man surnamed Kim told the JoongAng Ilbo. “My wife and I got married in this Covid season and we didn’t get to have our honeymoon. So we decided to take this time off during Chuseok to travel to Jeju Island, just the two of us.”           Kim is one out of 198,000 people expected to travel to Jeju Island over the five-day holiday, according to estimates by the Jeju provincial government. According to the Jeju Tourism Association, 70 percent of the five-star hotels on the island have been booked, as have 79.8 percent of the golf resorts.           It’s a worrying sign for the city government in Seoul, where a majority of cases had been recently.            “Last week, at least 17.5 percent of cases in Seoul were not traceable, and 30.8 percent of cases in the city were asymptomatic,” said Kim Hak-jin. “Think about what it could mean for the nation when silent spreaders of the virus travel from Seoul to other parts of the country. We ask everyone to please refrain from traveling. Your decision to stay at home will prove crucial in our fight to contain the outbreak during this holiday season.”           Korea saw 95 new cases Saturday, of which 73 were domestic cases and 22 imported, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).             Of the 73 domestic cases, 33 were based in Seoul.           Of the newly discovered clusters in Seoul, one concerned a group of cleaners who work at Sindorim Station in Guro District, western Seoul. Of the 17 cleaners, eight had tested positive as of Sunday according to Guro District Office, after eating their packed lunches together earlier in the week.           Other emerging clusters in Seoul include a care facility for the elderly in Dobong District, northern Seoul, which as of Sunday at noon had 24 cases total. A sauna in Gwanak District in southern Seoul also had 24 cases total as of Sunday at noon.           It was the second day in a row that new cases were in the double digits in Korea, after triple-digit daily caseloads were reported for four days earlier in the week.           Korea had a total of 23,611 Covid-19 cases as of Saturday. Two people died on Friday, bringing the country's death toll to 401. Another 82 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 21,248 as of Saturday.           BY ESTHER CHUNG, YI WOO-LIM  [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "
112,North warns South not to violate NLL,"

     South Korea’s Coast Guard conducts a search Saturday for the missing body of the fisheries official fatally shot last week by North Korea after he went missing near Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea. [NEWS1]         North Korea warned the South on Sunday to stop violating the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea, as the search continues for the body of a South Korean fisheries official shot last Tuesday.             South Korea’s Navy and Coast Guard however said that they have been searching for the body of the 47-year-old official surnamed Lee — who was shot and killed by North Korean soldiers last Tuesday after he mysteriously went missing the previous day — in waters south of the NLL.             Pyongyang’s warning came two days after an apology from North Korea Friday claiming that the man’s body had been lost at sea after he was shot, rather than burned, as initially reported by the South’s military.             The North’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported in an English-language dispatch Sunday, “We can never overlook any intrusion into our territorial waters and we seriously warn the south side against it.”           The North urged South Korean authorities to “immediately halt the intrusion across the military demarcation line in the west sea that may lead to escalation of tensions.”             The North may be referring to the West Sea military demarcation line (MDL), a line south of the NLL in the Yellow Sea that Pyongyang unilaterally declared in 1999. North Korean has long disputed the NLL, which was set by the United Nations Command (UNC) in 1953 after the three-year Korean War ended in a ceasefire.           The KCNA said that according to a report of the North Korean Navy’s western fleet, South Korea “mobilized many vessels including warships to an action presumed to be a search operation and let them intrude into our territorial waters since Sept. 25” which “arouses our due vigilance as it may lead to another awful incident.”           The South Korean military first confirmed last Thursday that the official working for its Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service had gone missing late Monday from the fishing inspection vessel Mugunghwa 10, disappearing in waters off Small Yeonpyeong Island. Intelligence indicated, according to the military, that he had been killed and burned by the North Tuesday after crossing the NLL in the Yellow Sea. Seoul’s military officials indicated that the North may have killed and burned him out of fear of the coronavirus and also that Lee might have intended to defect to the North.             The North made a rare apology Friday to the South Korean people and President Moon Jae-in, quoting leader Kim Jong-un, for the suspected fatal shooting of the South Korean citizen.           Suh Hoon, director of the National Security Office in the Blue House, relayed the message from the North’s United Front Department in a briefing Friday and said that North Korean soldiers fired around 10 shots “toward the illegal intruder” from 40 to 50 meters (131 to 164 feet) away in the sea.             The South Korean man was said to have refused to comply with their orders and at one point “hunkered down” on top of his “floating material” before he was shot, according to the North’s message. Bloodstains were said to have been found on the floating material.           However, the North denied that the man’s body had been burned, claiming that only materials left by the man had been burned, contradicting the South’s military’s analysis. There was also no mention of Lee’s intention to defect to the North. This assertion had also been previously questioned as Lee had left his government identification card on the boat before his disappearance.             The KCNA on Sunday described the incident as an “occurrence of an awful case which should not have happened in the present phase of the inter-Korean relation,” and added that the North took “necessary security measures in order to make sure that no more incident spoiling the relations of trust and respect between the north and the south would happen in any case.”             It also reported that the North is “about to organize a search operation in the southwestern waters and the western seashore” and is considering the “procedures and ways of handing over any tide-brought corpse to the south side” in case the body is discovered by its side.             In turn, South Korea's Coast Guard and Navy continued their search Sunday for the missing body of the official mobilizing 39 vessels and six aircraft near the NLL.             A South Korean Coast Guard official said that that the search operations are “taking place in waters south of the NLL,” but also noted that the actual border “considered by the North and South can be different.”           Two CCTV cameras on the Mugunghwa 10 were not functioning.           The Blue House National Security Council (NSC) on Sunday recognized the “discrepancies” in the details of the shooting between the South and North and requested for a joint investigation “to reveal the truth with an open posture and without being bound by the investigation results by each side.           Suh Choo-suk, the first deputy director of the Blue House National Security Office, said in a briefing Sunday after a meeting presided over by President Moon, that the South “takes positively North Korea’s speedy apology and pledges to prevent a recurrence.”             The Blue House also urged the restoration of a military hotline to communicate on the matter.           Suh added that Seoul has asked for the cooperation of Chinese authorities for China’s fishermen who operate in waters near the NLL to help retrieve the body and its belongings.             Political parties are clashing over the possibility of adopting a National Assembly resolution to denounce North Korea over its suspected killing of the South Korean official.           The Democratic Party (DP) initially pushed for the adoption of such a resolution after learning of the shooting, but shifted its stance following the Blue House revealing the North’s apology Friday.             In turn, lawmakers of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) staged a serial one-man rally Sunday, with lawmakers taking turns, in front of the Blue House protesting the handling of the shooting incident .             Rep. Kim Sung-won, a PPP deputy floor leader, during his turn held a picket asking, “We are looking for the president of the Republic of Korea.”             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]                    The Mugunghwa 10, the fishing inspection vessel that a South Korean fisheries official disappeared off of near the de facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea, is anchored off the coast of Mokpo in South Jeolla Sunday.

113,Kia plant hit with infections for second time this month,"

                  Kia Motors said Sunday three assembly line workers at one of its domestic plants tested positive for the new coronavirus, and a decision on whether to suspend the plant's operations will be made soon.           ""The plant is not in operation as it is Sunday. The company will make a decision on whether to [temporarily] halt the Sohari plant in Gwangmyeong tomorrow,"" a company spokesman said over the phone.           Kia, the country's second-biggest carmaker, halted the operations of the Sohari plant in Gwangmyeong, Gyeonggi from Sept. 16 through 21, with all of the 6,000 employees at the plants staying at home.          The plant's operations returned to normal last week as no more infections were reported at the plants. Eleven assembly line workers were infected with the virus last time, with the number of related cases reaching 18.           The company did not provide the value of production losses due to the suspension. The two plants in Gwangmyeong have a combined capacity of 320,000 units a year.           Kia produces the K9 flagship sedan, the Stinger sports car and the Carnival minivan at the No. 1 plant in Gwangmyeong and the Pride subcompact and the Stonic subcompact SUV at the No. 2 plant.           Kia has eight plants in Korea — two in Gwangmyeong, three in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi and three in Gwangju — and seven overseas ones — three in China and one each in the United States, Slovakia, Mexico and India.

114,LG Chem gets a boost in battery patent lawsuit against SK Innovation,"

     Headquarters of SK Innovation and LG Chem in Seoul. [YONHAP]               The legal battle between Korean battery makers has reignited after an investigative organization within the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Friday indicated it was supporting LG Chem over SK Innovation in an ongoing patent lawsuit.            LG Chem announced on Sunday that the Office of Unfair Import Investigations (OUII) had submitted a response to the ITC’s Chief Administrative Law Judge Charles E. Bullock on LG Chem’s motion to sanction SK Innovation for its spoliation of evidence.           LG Chem and SK Innovation have two ongoing lawsuits in the United States. One, filed by LG Chem in April last year, is on electric battery trade secrets, while the other, filed by SK Innovation and subject to a countersuit by LG Chem in September last year, pertains to electric vehicle (EV) battery patent infringement.             The commission's investigative staff publicly announced Friday that it had submitted a response asking the judge to sanction SK Innovation and SK Battery America for the spoliation of evidence.           LG Chem has argued that SK Innovation knew details of LG Chem’s A7 cell prior to “alleged inventions” that SK Innovation patented in 2015. LG Chem claims the A7 batteries were first sold to carmaker Chrysler in 2013.           LG Chem has ""raised a number of affirmative defenses in response to SKI’s [SK Innovation's] Complainant in this Investigation,"" the investigative staff wrote in the statement. ""They include the invalidity for failure to name the correct inventor on the 994 Patent and unclean hands due to spoliation of evidence.""           LG Chem said SK Innovation was found to have deleted emails mentioning LG Chem, even after the ITC judge ordered digital forensic inspection of SK Innovation’s computer systems.            SK Innovation on Sunday denied having deleted relevant documents, saying that the forensic examination shows that all the key documents were saved and submitted to the ITC as evidence.           SK Innovation also argued that its opinion against LG Chem's argument on the patent infringement lawsuit was not reflected in the OUII response made public Friday.           “SK Innovation submitted written opinion on LG Chem’s request for sanctions on Sept. 11, which is the day OUII released the statement,” the company said.             ITC’s final determination on misappropriation of trade secrets is scheduled to be announced on Oct. 26.

115,"Greenland's melting glaciers could have far-reaching effects, including along Korea's coast","

     A view of Russell Glacier in Qeqqata, Greenland. The glacier in Greenland is melting seven times more rapidly than it did in the early 1990s. [KIM IN-SOOK]             The JoongAng Ilbo’s special reporting team, through its 55th anniversary series, explores the impact of climate change on the Korean Peninsula and throughout the globe. The series focuses on climate disaster as seen from the eyes of locals and experts, exploring impacts ranging from changes in Jeju's aquatic ecosystem to the rising sea levels and the melting Arctic glaciers. - Ed.             Glaciers are melting in Greenland at an alarming rate, another warning signal of global warming that is contributing to rising global sea levels.             Kim In-sook is the only Korean national living in Greenland, and works for the country’s tourism office. On Sept. 12, he visited Russell Glacier in Qeqqata, Greenland, just some 50 kilometers (31 miles) below the Arctic Circle.           Kim led a team as part of the JoongAng Ilbo’s 55th anniversary series on climate change to witness the breaking ice shelves and melting glaciers in person. Instead of the usual bluish glaciers, they were greeted by a white layer of snow on the Russell Glacier from snowfall the previous day.           Locals who grew up seeing Greenland's majestic glacier, which covers 80 percent of the island, say they are witnessing the rapidly melting ice firsthand.             “I work in tourism; I’m up here almost every day,"" said Bjorn Luinge, a Greenland tour guide, who accompanied Kim. ""I get to see how things are changing firsthand. And a lot of things have been happening, of course, for the past 20 years.”           Signs of climate change are also evident in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland as melting ice sheets result in waterfalls.           “I can see that the glacier on the mountain is shrinking every year,” said Greenlandic Captain Erik Palo Jacobsen from Nuuk as he led the group to the Sermitsiaq Waterfall in Qeqqata. “I see it gets smaller and smaller. In fact, it’s turning into a waterfall, very clear proof that something is really happening and it’s happening quite fast.”           He continued, “The weather is getting more unpredictable, more severe. I’m thinking about my kids. They may be facing hard times because we don’t know exactly what climate change will do to this place.”                A view of the Sermitsiaq Waterfall in Qeqqata in Greenland. [KIM IN-SOOK]          Experts say that the ice is melting in Greenland some seven times more rapidly than it did in 1990.             According to a study by the ice sheet mass balance inter-comparison exercise (Imbie), an international collaboration between scientists established in 2011, the melt rate in Greenland has risen from 33 billion tons per year, on average, in the 1990s, to 254 billion tons per year over the last decade.           The combined analysis was carried out by a team of 96 polar scientists from 50 international organizations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys and included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass.           Greenland is estimated to have lost roughly 3.8 trillion tons of ice since 1992, according to Imbie.             The Imbie team found that Antarctica and Greenland lost 6.4 trillion tons of ice from 1992 to 2017, resulting in the increase in global sea levels by 0.7 inches (17.8 millimeters).           Experts say a continuous atmospheric high-pressure zone in Greenland is resulting in warmer weather, and that consequently there is less snowfall and ice is melting more rapidly. Global climate change, driven in large part by carbon emissions, is seen as contributing to the phenomenon.             The disappearing glaciers and unpredictable weather is also impacting locals in Greenland, especially dog sledding, a traditional mode of transportation in the wintertime necessary for hunting and fishing activities.             Locals point out that they were historically able to dog sled until June, however this year, they were able to do so until April.             The dogs are spending more time tied up, said one local, Francisca Davidson Olsen, a resident of Kangerlussuaq in Qeqqata.             “The Greenlandic sled dogs have developed to drive out into the cold instead of the heat,” she said. “They are very dependent on the ice that should be frozen so that they can get from one place to another.”              Dogs in Kangerlussuaq in Qeqqata spend more and more time tied up as dog sledding season gets shorter due to warmer weather and melting ice. [KIM IN-SOOK]         Climate experts point out that the glacial melt is not just a far-off phenomenon happening in the Arctic, and that if they continue to disappear at the current rate, it could also impact the Korean Peninsula in the coming decades.           Korean climate expert Kim Baek-min, a professor of Pukyong National University, said, “If the sea level rises just 30 centimeters [12 inches] higher, Busan’s Haeundae Beach, Incheon’s Songdo and other port cities will face major flooding damages. It is also very possible that several kilometers of the coastline of the Korean Peninsula may erode.”           Experts warn of a butterfly effect from the Greenlandic glacial melting and rising global sea levels.             According to a recent study by Greenpeace Korea on the consequences of rising sea levels, over 5 percent of the land in Korea will be submerged by 2030.             Some 3.32 million people living in Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon could be directly impacted by flooding, according to the study. Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport, among other major facilities, could be submerged in water, especially with the summertime typhoons and flooding.             The speed of glaciers melting is accelerating. According to the Imbie study, in the early 1990s the rate of loss of Greenland's glaciers was equivalent to about one millimeter per decade, but it is now roughly seven millimeters per decade.           Scientists stress that it is more important than ever to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to set out specific guidelines for this objective.             “The rise in sea levels due to melting glaciers can bring about super typhoons and other extreme climate phenomena in Korea, resulting in an even more serious, complex disaster,” Prof. Kim said. “That is the reason why we have to become a net-zero society.”           “The government’s Green New Deal can be a good policy to encourage environment-friendly projects but is not a policy that can address the climate crisis,"" said Jeong Sang-hoon, a member of Greenpeace Korea's climate and energy change campaign.           “We need to immediately set forward policies to reduce long-term carbon emissions and build dams to prevent flooding and minimize damages,"" said Ho Chang-hoi, a climate physics professor at Seoul National University.           BY SPECIAL REPORTING TEAM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "
116,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Will Korea's airline industry ever really take off again?,"

     Incheon International Airport stands empty in July as international travelers plummet due to the Covid-19 pandemic. [NEWS1]                                Throughout his 28-year career, Park Yi-sam enjoyed the perks of living as a pilot. He received a higher salary than his friends and often took his family on overseas trips, not to mention the respect people showed toward him and his family.          Like so many others, Park's world came crashing down with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. His lavish lifestyle was quickly overtaken by mounting piles of debt, and Park started to genuinely worry about how he would feed his family. In April, two months after Eastar Jet stopped paying Park's full wage, his wife started working at a restaurant in order to pay the bills.           That didn't last long either — she lost the job after the government imposed stricter regulations on restaurants on Aug. 30 to curb a spike in coronavirus cases.           “I never imagined such a thing would happen to me,” said Park, the head of Eastar Jet’s pilot union, during an interview on Sept. 1. “I have been through numerous viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], but never has any of them lasted as long or impacted the world as much as Covid-19.”          Park is now considering taking on a part-time job as a delivery driver to make ends meet. Many of his colleagues have already taken that step, working as day laborers at construction sites, moving produce in cold storage facilities or even working as an extra in the entertainment industry.                    Pilot unions from different airlines, including Eastar Jet, hold a press event in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Sept. 22, demanding the struggling Eastar Jet file for court receivership and withdraw the decision to lay off workers. [NEWS1]    Unemployment          The aviation industry has been one of the hardest hit by Covid-19. With travel restrictions now in place around the world, airlines have been unable to operate overseas routes, significantly more profitable than domestic alternatives.           As a result, airlines have been forced to either cut down routes or stop operations entirely.           Eastar Jet shut down operations of domestic and overseas routes starting in March.           Korean Air Lines shrunk its international routes from 110 before the virus to 34 as of September, while Asiana Airlines similarly reduced international routes from around 70 to 25 during the same period.           No flights means no money and no work, so airline employees were put on unpaid leave, including those from Asiana Airlines.           But even unpaid leave was a stretch for some airlines, resorting to large-scale layoffs instead.           Eastar Jet employees haven’t been paid properly since February. After bigger budget carrier Jeju Air decided not to acquire Eastar Jet earlier this year, 605 of the remaining 1,300 employees were laid off. Back of March, Eastar had around 1,600 employees.           Among those laid off was a 31-year-old co-pilot surnamed Jang. He was in his third year with Eastar Jet before Covid-19 surfaced.           Jang graduated university with 140 million won ($119,000) in debt due to the expensive pilot training programs, with 70 million won still remaining to be paid back.           “All I have learned my whole life is to be a pilot,” Jang said. “It’s a very specialized job. So no matter how hard I look into different career paths, there just seems to be no other option.”           A stewardess from Asiana Airlines said her colleagues are also fearing layoffs as a result of the collapse of an acquisition deal with Hyundai Development Company.           “Internally, we expect a major layoff,” said a member of Asiana Airlines cabin crew who wished to remain anonymous. “Employee reactions toward potential layoffs are divided into two groups. One group is preparing to prove to the company that they’re valuable assets by studying foreign languages, while the other group is preparing to find a new career. Home shopping channel hosts and TV meteorologists are a few of the careers they are considering.”           Apart from airline employees, those working at airports, duty-free shops, travel agencies, hotels and other partnering companies, like catering service providers or engine makers, have all been affected by the reduced number of international travelers.           According to data from the Korea Economic Research Institute earlier this month, a total of 119,000 jobs linked to the tourism industry that were expected to have been created from March through June this year never came into existence.           During that period, the number of foreign tourists dipped 98.97 percent to 52,487 from 5,105,686.                Plummeting sales          Following the pandemic, the number of travelers plummeted.           Just in August, the total number of passengers passing through Incheon International Airport fell to 235,000, 96.3 percent less than the same month a year earlier.           Budget carriers are particularly vulnerable to the falling numbers.           In Korea, there are nine low-cost carriers, including the newly launched Fly Gangwon, Aero K and Air Premia.           The largest among them is Jeju Air, which saw its sales dip 62.4 percent on year to 265.28 billion won in the first half of the year. It swung to 202 billion won in net loss from 12.64 billion won profit during the same period the previous year, possibly explaining the reason it pulled out of the Eastar Jet deal.           The second-largest Jin Air, 60 percent owned by Hanjin KAL, also saw its sales fall 66.85 percent on year to 167.13 billion won in the first half of the year. It swung to 104.74 billion won in net loss during the same period from 7.42 billion won profit a year ago.           Other budget carriers, including Air Busan and T’way Air, also suffered net losses this year.           Among the three new low-cost carriers, only Fly Gangwon has been able to start operating flights. Aero K and Air Premia are yet to receive air operator’s certificates (AOC) from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The reason for the delay hasn’t been explained, but AOCs are required for an airline to begin operating flights.           Despite the lack of travelers, full-service carriers have seen their earnings improve slightly in the second quarter thanks to a new focus on cargo transportation.             Korean Air Lines’ sales in the second quarter went down 44.63 percent on year to 1.73 trillion won, but it swung to a net profit during the same period to 117.37 billion won, from a loss of 365.06 billion won.           “Around 30 percent of air cargo is transported via passenger aircraft globally,” said Hong Seok-yun, a spokesperson for Korean Air Lines. “But following the international lockdowns, that 30 percent of the air cargo transportation has diminished. The decreased supply helped raise transportation prices, improving the profit model.”           Earlier this month, Korean Air Lines remodeled the interior of two B777-300ER passenger aircraft to carry more cargo.           Asiana Airlines also saw improved earnings from cargo transportation.           Its sales decreased 49.21 percent on year in the second quarter to 886.41 billion won, but it turned to 50 billion won in net profit from 202.44 billion won in net loss during the same period.           Analysts project the cargo boom will continue for the rest of the year.           “The market conditions for cargo transportation in July and August rose 1.4 percent on year,” said analyst Ryu Je-hyun from Mirae Asset Daewoo.           “Cargo transportation will continue to make profits throughout the fourth quarter, which is traditionally the peak season. Losses from sluggish international transportation of passengers are projected to continue.”                    Carriers parked idle at Incheon International Airport in April. [YONHAP]    Attempts at structural reform          Airline struggles are continuing due to uncertainties in the industry, which have already led to the collapse of acquisition deals for both Eastar Jet and Asiana Airlines.           On Sept. 11, Kumho Industrial terminated an acquisition deal it signed with HDC after the construction company continuously delayed closing the deal and demanded further due diligence. In July, Jeju Air abandoned its acquisition of Eastar Jet, saying its shareholders didn’t think it was a good idea.           The collapse of the acquisition deals left more than 600 Eastar Jet employees unemployed and Asiana Airlines being managed by its creditor Korea Development Bank (KDB).           Some experts argue that mergers between airlines are needed to stop them from going bankrupt.           “Instead of waiting for government support or for the virus to come to an end, carriers need to actively find solutions on their own, including merging with another carrier,” said Prof. Hur Hee-young, who teaches business at Korea Aerospace University. “Mergers aren’t common business practice in Korea, but merging could help airlines save a lot of jobs. Aviation is a network business. By merging, they can share routes and fly fewer unseated planes, saving cost.”           Previous mergers by overseas airlines include Air France’s merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in 2004, which changed the company name to Air France KLM, and America West Airlines' merger with US Airways in 2005.           Prof. Choi Jeong-chul, who teaches at the Graduate School of Manufacturing Innovation at Inha University, believes low-cost carriers (LCCs) just have to hang in there a little longer until Covid-19 is over.           “LCCs play the role of connecting local airports in suburbs to overseas international airports in suburban areas, which are routes not easily operated by full-size carriers due to the size of their planes,” said Choi. “It shouldn’t be generalized that LCCs are a saturated market just because they are facing heated competition for domestic routes. Until Covid-19 stabilizes, LCCs should hang in there by cutting costs through various measures, including unpaid leave.”       Future of the industry          Opinions on whether travel demand will ever fully recover remain divided.           Prof. Choi from Inha University believes everything will go back to normal once a Covid-19 vaccine is developed.           “Once a vaccine is developed, Covid-19 will be regarded as a simple flu that people can easily get over. When we reach that period, the repressed desire to travel will burst and boost travel demand,” Choi said.           Prof. Hur from Korea Aerospace University, on the other hand, believes flying will become an expensive transportation means in the post Covid-19 era.           Since seats have been rearranged to ensure social distancing, the price of tickets will increase, especially on long-distance routes like to Europe or America. This is projected to shrink demand for long-distance travel, according to Hur.           Hur added that chartered services will rise as an alternative for wealthy people in the post-Covid-19 era.           “Since airlines hardly fly any international routes, an increasing number of people could turn to private services business aviation to go on trips.” Hur said.           “This is common overseas, especially in developing countries where newly rich people live. In Korea, however, the market has been stagnant because of the general anticonglomerate sentiment, meaning people disagree with the idea of rich businesspeople enjoying special treatment.”           Businesspeople, who are usually on a tight schedule, can save time using chartered and private services with shortened customs processes and by directly flying to the destination instead of having to transit when flying to a destination that can’t be reached by commercial airlines.           “Business aviation contributes to boosting local economies by adding jobs, as aircraft need to be cleaned, refueled and go through maintenance after landing,” Hur added.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]   Related ArticleEastar Jet's pilot union pushes for receivership of airlineHDC may sue Kumho Industrial and Asiana AirlinesAsiana deal falls apart, creditors left to manage airlineAirlines, bankrupt and otherwise, stiff passengers for refunds "
117,[TEST DRIVE] There are few rides more comfortable than the Volvo S90,"

     Volvo's face-lifted S90 sedan. [VOLVO CARS KOREA]               Volvo is hoping to follow the success of brand ambassador Son Heung-min, who recently became the 28th player in English Premier League history to score four goals in a single match, with the release of its partially revamped S90 sedan.           The Tottenham Hotspur star isn't just the Swedish automaker's brand ambassador, but also the model for the new S90, which has been newly released with a facelifted version for the first time in four years. Volvo Cars Korea is hoping the new sedan will change the paradigm in the country’s import car market, where non-German or non-Japanese cars haven't been very successful.           This is first time that Son has served as brand ambassador for an automotive company.           “Just like Son is showing leadership in his field, Volvo wanted to show a similar presence in the E-segment with the new S90,” the company explained.              Tottenham Hotspur's Son Heung-min poses with the S90. [VOLVO CARS KOREA]               To see if the car is really that ""Sonsational,"" the Korea JoongAng Daily got behind the wheel of the B5 Inscription trim of the S90 topped with a 48-volt mild hybrid powertrain for a 100-kilometer (62-mile) round trip from Yeouido in western Seoul to Incheon.           Before hitting the road, this reporter climbed into the second row to check out the rear passenger experience.           The experience was surprising. The S90 offers a genuinely shocking amount of legroom in the rear, taking advantage of a 125-millimeter (5-inch) extension to the body length — now totaling 5,090 millimeters. Its wheelbase has also been extended 120 millimeters to help the back seat become more spacious.           Once on the road, the sedan was able to pull off its signature smooth and quiet acceleration and stable handling. The new S90, like most of Volvo lineup, is not the best car for dynamic driving, lacking the quick acceleration and agile handling at high speeds.   There was also noticeable rumbling when the car reached speeds over 110 kilometers per hour.           But if you're not looking for thrills, the S90 is one of the best cars to drive around the city, getting you from A to B in comfort. And safely, which has always been a priority for Volvo.          In line with that logic, it installed its own safety package called City Safety in all trims. The package includes an automatic brake system and collision avoidance system that helps drivers from crashing into other vehicles, objects and people. The car is also able to brake on its own, keeping a preset distance from the car in front. Up to speeds of 140 kilometers per hour, the car is able to navigate on its own on roads under the Pilot Assist 2 program.           The pilot assist system, once activated, helped this reporter to relax a bit on the highway, driving on its own at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour. It was able to navigate a winding road and control the distance with the car in front while staying in the middle of the lane.           But the system is still routed in safety protocol — if the driver's hands leave the steering wheel for more than 10 seconds, a warning appears on the head-up display.              Volvo's S90 sedan comes with advanced air-cleaner system to control the air quality inside the car. [VOLVO CARS KOREA]               The S90 also newly added what’s called an advanced air cleaner in all trims, which is able to sense the quality of the air and purify it if necessary. A digital monitor on the center console shows the air quality every 10 minutes.           For both the driver and the passenger, the new S90 couldn’t provide a more comfortable and safe ride.           Its price starts at 60.3 million won ($51,400) with a 5-year 100,000-kilometer warranty service.           It has a little bit of a competitive edge in price over its competitors, including Mercedes-Benz’s E-Class and BMW’s 5 Series, all of which have prices starting from 63 million won.           Volvo Cars Korea said that more than 3,200 reservations have already been placed for the model.           In response to the rising popularity of the brand here, the importer and distributor said it is in negotiation with the Swedish headquarters to expand the quantity from the current 1,000 to 3,000 units next year.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "
118,India is the battleground country for Samsung and Apple,"

     Customers in India look at Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip at an exhibition hall in Gurugram, India. [SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS]               Samsung Electronics and Apple are doing everything they can to capture India, with 1.4 billion potential customers and the world’s second-largest market.           They are competitively opening stores, upping the marketing and introducing affordable smartphone models in a race to be the pioneers in the country.             India is considered a land of opportunity as almost half of the population has never owned a smartphone before. The stars seem to be aligning, and world politics is in their favor, as a growing number of Indian consumers are seeking alternatives to Chinese smartphones amid budding anti-Chinese sentiment.             Apple opened its first online store in India Sept. 23, the first direct sales channel for the U.S. smartphone company in the country. Previously Indian consumers could only purchase Apple devices through Bengaluru, India-based e-commerce site Flipkart or via Amazon.               The company plans to open an offline store in Mumbai, India, next year. Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted the U.S. smartphone maker will “connect and expand support in India.”              A tweet of Apple CEO Tim Cook, introducing the company's first online store in India. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               Samsung, which opened its first physical store in India in September 2018, recently rehired Sumit Walia from India’s smartphone maker Oppo as the head of marketing for the India division. He is now Samsung India's marketing head, mobile division.           Sumit built his career at various smartphone manufacturing companies, such as Huawei and LG Electronics, and worked for nine years at Samsung India before heading to the homegrown company. He was largely responsible for Oppo’s remarkable success in the past year. Oppo was the fifth-largest smartphone brand in India in the first quarter of this year and outperformed Realme in the next quarter to reach fourth place.           “Sumit Walia’s appointment is crucial for the company’s efforts to increase its market share in India. The company expects more people who are currently working for Oppo and previously worked for Samsung to follow Sumit Walia in rejoining Samsung’s side,” reported SamMobile, an IT industry publication.             Indian consumers are very sensitive to price. For a long time, the most popular products were Xiaomi devices priced around 200,000 won ($170). Samsung smartphones were oftentimes considered the product for the rich and have been neglected by local consumers.            Smartphone sales in India for the second quarter dropped 51 percent on year and reached 18.4 million devices due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according to CounterPoint research.           Sales of Samsung smartphones are growing. Xiaomi has 29 percent of the domestic market, and Samsung is at 26 percent. Vivo came in third place with 17 percent. In the first quarter, Samsung's market share was 16 percent.             Anti-Chinese sentiment coupled with an informal boycott of Chinese products in India may have helped push sales.             India has been in conflict with China for control of parts of Kashmir. Samsung and Apple have been trying to use this sentiment and increase marketing in an effort to enlarge its share of the pie in the Indian market.             “India’s smartphone market is projected to gradually increase in the third quarter, and we expect manufacturers will aggressively try to target the market,” said researcher Park Jin-seok of CounterPoint Research. “Samsung will likely rack up the most benefits as sentiment against Chinese brands grows in India.”              Customers in India test Samsung's new Galaxy Note 20 at the company's offline store in Bengaluru, India. [SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS]               Smartphone makers are also coming up with affordable options to meet Indian consumer preferences for cheaper products.             “It’s more important to increase market share with cheaper products than trying to attain bigger marginal profits by selling expensive products,” said one industry source. “This is because India is the world’s second-largest market and has great growth potential.”           Samsung will introduce the Galaxy F, an affordable line of smartphones priced between 200,000 won to 300,000 won, in India. LG Electronics has its “India Specific and India First” initiative and has hit the markets with the affordable Model W series.           Apple, known for its high-priced products, is pushing its budget offerings.

121,[ZOOM KOREA] Ceramic artist finds inspiration for his moon jars in the beauty of a pine tree ,"

     Ceramic artist Shin Chul assembles the upper part of a moon jar with the lower part at his ceramic studio Huguro-Bitzun-Dal, located in Icheon, Gyeonggi. [BY PARK SANG-MOON]                Traditional rounded white porcelain, reminiscent of a full moon, is one of the representative cultural heritages of Korea. Often dubbed as a moon jar, the plump porcelain first appeared during the late Joseon Dynasty between the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th century. And three centuries after its advent, the simple white jar is still loved.               From a cultural perspective, moon jars are valuable assets as only about 20 pieces remain both at home and abroad.           Ceramic artist Shin Chul takes inspiration from the potters of the Joseon period.            The artist began making moon jars in 2005 and has produced more than 1,000 pieces so far. No one has ever baked moon jars as intensely as Shin.             Born in Wonju, Gangwon, Shin grew up as an ordinary child in the countryside. As he was entering into adolescence, Shin came across a pottery wheel during an art class back in high school. This chance encounter led to a decisive change in his life.            He firmly believed that making porcelain was meant to be his job for the rest of his life. He eventually decided to learn how to make porcelain instead of advancing to college.             Shin landed a job at Hanyang Porcelain Lab located in Jongno, central Seoul before he had even graduated from high school. But his day job did not appease his thirst for ceramics. He headed to a pottery kiln located in Byeokje, Gyeonggi.             During the day, Shin worked at the porcelain lab and at night he learned the techniques needed for baking ceramics at the kiln in Byeokje.             Senior workers around Shin advised him to go on to college if he was really serious about pursuing a career as a potter. Otherwise, they said he wouldn't be taken seriously as an artist.                Shin makes a moon jar. [BY PARK SANG-MOON]                 His life took many twists and turns before he entered the department of ceramic arts at Dankook University but after he was admitted, his only focus became studying.             As Shin made the best use of his days by studying and spent his nights at kilns in Byeokje and Gimpo, he only found time for some shut-eye while commuting on buses.             Shin, who stood out among his fellow students, made more than 300 pieces of porcelains every day.             After he graduated and completed his mandatory military service, Shin got married and opened a studio of his own in Deokso, Gyeonggi in 1989. He was 28 years old.             Until he moved his studio from Deokso to the Ceramic Arts Village in Icheon, Gyeonggi in 2016, Shin tirelessly baked porcelain in Deokso for 27 years.             After settling down in Icheon, which is known as Korea's ceramics home, Shin began giving lectures at the Chungkang College of Cultural Industries, also located in Icheon. He continued his teaching for the next 15 years.             Shin's expertise is the moon jar but he also used to produce celadon porcelain, or cheongja.             Of all the techniques used for cheongja, Shin is particularly talented at creating yeollimun, or marbled patterns. This technique thrived in the 12th-century Goryeo Dynasty for a short period of time. The pattern was mostly used for tea bowls or containers for loose powder. Only about 10 pieces of cheongja with yeollimun are left across the world.                 Shin’s reproduction of celadon porcelain, or cheongja, with yeollimun, or marbled patterns. [BY PARK SANG-MOON]                Shin dedicated himself to reproducing yeollimun for 14 years from 1983. He also wrote about this particular reproduction procedure as a thesis. His creations sold out the year he held his first exhibition in 2001.             While working on cheongja with yeollimun, however, Shin felt he was limited as an artist. He thought it was hard for him to create something traditional that can show the beauty of Korea with yeollimun.             It was one day in 2005 when Shin saw an exhibition themed on moon jars held at the National Palace Museum of Korea that his ""aha"" moment struck and he realized he had to work on moon jars.             In late 2005, Shin began working on moon jars. A series of trials and errors awaited him.             Over the next nine years he created over 1,000 moon jars. Despite painful shoulders and the tremendous cost of purchasing soil and firewood, he persisted.            But things didn't go as well as Shin hoped. During an exhibition in Tokyo, Japan in 2010, a Japanese professor said, ""I can't find Shin Chul in his moon jars.""             The artist was dismayed and the criticism sent him into a five-year slump.            But a pine tree Shin saw near the Jungyeongmyo Royal Tomb at Samcheok, Gangwon was the inspiration he needed.            Shin decided to make a moon jar that was as confident and healthy as the pine tree, often dubbed the most beautiful pine tree in Korea.                 A moon jar created by Shin. [BY PARK SANG-MOON]                Shin's moon jars are not just round porcelain. The curve that starts from the opening embodies its humble beauty while the foot, which sustains the globular shape, is confident. All these features are created by the hands of Shin and resemble the pine tree the artist saw at Samcheok.             Shin's latest work mainly focuses on reproducing moon jars from the Joseon Dynasty.             In the early days, Shin wanted to address the original personality of moon jars. Then he focused on showing the healthy sides of porcelain. These days, he pays attention to the pure nature of ceramics, which is not only about being good and gentle but also about harmony with nature.             Shin believes the beauty of the moon jar from the Joseon Dynasty lies in its natural state. He wants to go back to the archetype of the moon jar.             BY PARK SANG-MOON   [moonpark@joongang.co.kr]   "

125,Cash is truly king in time of coronavirus,"






     Workers from the note-issuing bureau of the Bank of Korea in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Thursday unload brand-new bank notes to be circulated in commercial banks for the coming Chuseok harvest holidays. [JOINT PRESS CORPS]         The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a craze for contactless payments — one way of avoiding infection.            But that didn't mean that cash was being scorned. In fact, a Bank of Korea (BOK) report on Sunday showed that the coronavirus reminded many people in Korea, the United States and Europe that ""cash is king"" in times of trouble — and hoarding of cash rose.           According to BOK data, the on-year growth of Korean won in circulation hit 15.9 percent in July, up from 10.3 percent in March, 11.7 percent in April, 13.3 percent in May and 14.5 percent in June.            The redemption rate for the 50,000-won ($42.5) note, Korea's largest, dropped to 20.9 percent during the March to August period of this year, compared to 60.1 percent for all of 2019.             That means that for every 10 units of 50,000-won notes issued by the central bank, only two returned to the bank — and eight were kept by either households, in mattresses or cookie jars, or financial institutions, in vaults.             “With the spread of Covid-19 and lockdowns of countries, people’s desire to have cash in their pockets rose as they worried that their access to money might be restricted,” the bank said.             “Financial institutions also scrambled to secure cash in order to meet demand for exchange of currencies and payments as the pandemic triggered unstable supplies of cash.”           The trend was also apparent in other countries including the United States, Japan and European Union member states.             In the United States, the growth rate of its currency in circulation averaged 13 percent between March and August this year, an 8 percentage point jump compared to the same period last year when the figure stood at 5 percent.             According to a U.S. Federal Reserve survey done in May, the amount of cash people carry increased from $69 to $81, a 17 percent increase from the same survey done in October 2019. The amount of cash stored elsewhere such as at home or in the office increased from $257 to $487 during the period.             In the European Union, the growth rate of currency in circulation averaged 9 percent during the March to July period  compared to 5 percent a year earlier.             Japan's figure was 6 percent in July and August compared to 3 percent during the same period a year earlier.       “Economic players prefer cash as a way of securing safe assets,” the bank said.            “The demand for cash centered around high-value notes such as 200-euro [$233] bills in Europe and 10,000-yen [$95] bills in Japan, which is a similar trend seen in financial crises in the past.”           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

Late documentary photographer Lim In-sik (1920-1998), his son Lim Chung-eui and grandson Lim Jun-young are the photographers in question.           The second- and third-generation photographers shared their memories of their father and grandfather with JoongAng Ilbo, in time for the ongoing photo exhibition ""Life Goes On"" at Leica store in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, which runs through Oct. 4. In the exhibit, visitors can take a look at what Seoul looked like in the 1950s through pictures taken by Lim In-sik.           The late Lim took black-and-white photos of central Seoul's Myeong-dong, Jongno, Samcheong-dong as well as Gahoe-dong where his house used to be to show the lives of people after the Korean War.           Some photos show views from above which Lim achieved by getting in a small airplane. He showed great interest in cameras and photos from his early 20s, and started to take more photos after he moved to Seoul from North Pyongan Province in North Korea in 1944.            Since his studio was in Yongsan District while he lived in Gahoe-dong, he was able to photograph many historic events like the day Korea was liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 when the Japanese left the Yongsan station, as well as the event to announce the establishment of Korea in 1948.           He also provided such photos to major media outlets overseas including AP. His older brother Lim Seok-je was also a documentary photographer.              The area around Dongdaemun Stadium in 1954, which is now Dongdaemun Design Plaza. [LIM IN-SIK]               Photos of Dongdaemun Stadium taken by the grandfather, father and again by the son to show how the area has changed act as rare records. The grandson, June-young, held a photo exhibition titled “The Big Flow” to show the works of all four photographers in the family in 2016.           The son and the grandson are particularly proud of their family creating records of how Korea has changed in pictures.           “Since when I was younger, I did work a lot in the dark room to help my father, and I couldn’t help but naturally get comfortable with photo-taking,” said the son, Chung-eui.           “However my father was really against the idea of me becoming a photographer. Basically it was an occupation with which you can’t make much money.""              Dongdaemun Stadium in 1997 by Lim Chung-eui. [LIM CHUNG-EUI]               Yet Chung-eui, as if it was meant to be, chose to follow in the footsteps of his family before him. He started his career as media photographer at the Korea Herald in 1973 where he worked for two years. After he left the company, he really geared up to be a photographer who specialized in taking pictures of architecture as he met architect Kim Swoo-geun. With the Asian Games in 1986 and the Seoul Olympics in 1988 changing the landscape of Seoul so much, Lim took detailed photos of all the updates the city was undergoing at the time.           He also took photos of less-changed areas in Geumho-dong, central Seoul, which was known as a less-privileged neighborhood at that time, to show the contrast between neighborhoods in Seoul. He continued to take photos of architectural subjects for over 50 years and just recently started to focus more on morning scenes across Korea, in which nature harmonizes with man-made buildings.           “I chose to live a life of a photographer against my father’s advice, yet I did the same when my son decided to do what I did,” said Lim Chung-eui.           “I have done it for all my life, and I know that the path isn’t easy, so how can I be [supportive] of what my son says?""              A photo by Lim June-young of Dongdaemun Design Plaza, which was built on the site where Dongdaemun Stadium used to be. [LIM JUNE-YOUNG]               But just like the father didn’t follow the words of the grandfather, the grandson June-young also chose not to heed his own father's advice. He even left for the United States to study photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York. He started what is now his major work, the “Like Water” series, in which he expresses the energy from people in the city bursting out of buildings as they leave work in the evenings.           What he learned was the power of photographs that are taken to record the history.           “Even for a restaurant to be handed down over three generations, it just has to accept the new changes as a more modern system, and its flavor profiles should follow as the generations change,” said Lim June-young.              Lim June-young, left, and his father Lim Chung-eui pose at Leica store in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, where the photo exhibition of their grandfather and father Lim In-sik and June-young, is being held until Oct. 4.

The archive of photos taken by the senior Lim and his older brother. The quantity of film of their work is an unthinkable amount.           “We Koreans were busy getting the new things set up and were lax about getting rid of old things,” said June-young. “Since the past is what connects the present to the future, I want to hand down the photos to the next generation.""           BY LEE SUN-MIN   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]   "
128,Reimagining of Gwanghwamun Square continues,"

     A sketch of the new design for Gwanghwamun Square. [SEOUL METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT]               Construction on Gwanghwamun Square will commence next month as the Seoul city government tries to turn it into something more like a park and less like a traffic island.             “The roads on the east side of the square will be changed in a stage-by-stage manner so as to incur the least possible traffic difficulties,” the Seoul Metropolitan Government said in a statement Sunday. “The construction will start at the end of October.”           The city government’s plan to revamp the square was first announced in 2018. It involved expanding the square westward and incorporating the southbound roads between the square and the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts, and rerouting the roads in front of Gyeongbok Palace to incorporate that area into the square as well.           Some experts warned of traffic nightmares and the public opposed earlier plans, leading to major changes.           The southbound roads west of the square will still be incorporated, but not the roads in front of the palace. Instead the five lanes of northbound traffic on the eastern side will be expanded to three going in one direction and four going in the other.           “This is a plan finalized after holding 61 hearings open to the public from September to December 2019, and an additional 100 this year,” the city government said.           The city government said that there was a high level of interest among those who took part in these hearings to see the square turned into a green space where people can sit and rest under the shade of trees.           “The renovation of the square is part of a larger plan to create a 2.6 kilometer [1.6 mile] green pedestrian-friendly walkway from the Gwanghwamun area to Seoul Station,” the city government said. “We hope this will not only provide a green space for the people but also boost business prospects for local stores in the area due to increased foot traffic.”           The plan includes turning Sejong-daero 23-gil, a road that runs east to west south of Sejong Center, into a pedestrian space.             The new plan also abandoned the idea of creating an underground passageway that connects the Gwanghwamun area to the City Hall area, and from there through the Euljiro area toward Dongdaemun.           “A simpler remodeling of the current underground space under the square will take place instead,” the city government said.             The original plan to bring back a terrace from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) that was outside Gwanghwamun Gate of Gyeongbok Palace for kings to hold public rituals, called woldae in Korean, is to be discussed with the cultural heritage authorities.            “We will have to discuss with the Cultural Heritage Administration about whether there may be ways to bring this back without affecting traffic in the area,” the city government said.             The new plan made no mention about moving the statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sun-sin from the square, which had once been part of the city government’s discussions about the new square’s design.             BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         "
129,Tigers pitcher's son recovering from accident,"

                  Kia Tigers' pitcher Aaron Brooks took to social media to thank his fans and fellow players in the KBO for their support for his son, who is recovering from injuries sustained in a recent auto accident.           In a video clip posted on his Instagram page Friday, Brooks and his wife, Whitney, provided an update on Westin, who was seriously hurt in a crash caused by a driver running a red light in Kansas City earlier this week. Brooks left the Tigers to be by his family. Whitney and the couple's daughter, Monroe, escaped with relatively minor injuries, and Westin took the brunt of the hit.              Aaron Brooks [NEWS1]         ""If and when you see the picture of the car, it's a miracle that they're all here, especially Westin,"" Brooks said. ""We're doing as well as we can as a family. We're so thankful for everyone's support. I think it's what's keeping us somewhat sane through this. Obviously, it's hard for any parent to go through something like this. We're just trying to stay strong for Westin and just let him know it's going to be okay.”           Brooks said his son is ""a trooper"" as he battles through his injuries. Whitney said Westin was supposed to be intubated for 48 hours but that he was already out of the intensive care unit.           ""Every time doctors come in, they're blown away, literally in awe of how well he's doing,"" Whitney said. ""It's because of the prayers. We really appreciate it. It's so overwhelming, the love and support that we have. I wish I can line you guys up and give you hugs personally because you deserve it.""           Whitney said she has completely forgiven the driver who crashed into her car by running a red light because she believes it was an accident, and pleaded with her supporters to do the same.           ""I think he has enough guilt in his life...He stood there and watched them pull the kids out of the car. That's enough for a person,"" she said. ""I pray that he's okay, too. I want anybody who's holding on to any grudge against him [to] let it go. It's not worth it. We need to be thankful that Westin is with us and that he's progressing so well.”           Whitney said Westin loves pictures and videos with messages of support for him, including the one of Tigers players holding up the ""W"" sign for his name when they get on base, and asked followers to keep sending them pictures and videos.           With his young son still ""not out of the woods,"" baseball remains well down the list of priorities for Brooks.           Yonhap   "
130,[Heroes from afar] South Africa's 'Flying Cheetahs' took to the air during Korean War,"

     Ambassador of South Africa to Korea, Zenani N. Dlamini. [EMBASSY OF SOUTH AFRICA IN KOREA]   ━   The allied nation lost dozens of troops and scores of fighter jets                 Lt. Piet Visser had a bird’s-eye view of Korea in 1952, arriving from South Africa to a land he remembers as populated mainly by rice paddies and thatched-roof houses.           “I never did any fighting on the ground, I was always in the air on the Mustang aircraft,” Visser said in an Aug. 3 phone interview. “We would be given the ground position of either the tanks or the bridges that the North Koreans and Chinese were using [...] and we would be dispatched to destroy them, always in groups of fours, and never less than four at a time.”           Visser was one of 826 South Africans who served in the Korean War (1950-1953). They served as part of the No. 2 Squadron of the South African Air Force, assigned with the U.S. Air Force’s 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing, flying a total of 12,067 sorties throughout the war, according to the South African Embassy in Korea.              No. 2 Squadron personnel at the K-46 advanced air base at Hoengsong, Gangwon, in 1952. [SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE MUSEUM/ SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         They provided much-needed relief for the United Nations forces on the ground, as was the case near the frontlines on May 4, 1951.           “I’ll forever recall with minute detail the most spectacular feat I’ve ever lived to witness and tell about,” American Private First Class J.P. Megnin recalled in a June 23, 1951 letter addressed to the “Flying Cheetahs” — a nickname given to the South African Air Force's No. 2 Squadron.            “We had gained the ridgeline of our objective, upon which we were catching all hell because of an overwhelming enemy counterattack,” he wrote. “The tide of battle was leaving casualties in its wake-like seashells cast upon a [beach's] sands [...] It was then we saw four silvery streaks plummet from the skies above with guns blazing.             “It was so wondrous a sight we completely forgot our whereabouts or line and just stood up in our foxholes and cheered,” Megnin continued. “I’ll never forget the astonishment on the men’s faces, nor their remarks of ‘those c-r-a-z-y bastards,’ as those four mighty F-51’s barely cleared the tree-tops. Our carelessness of standing and cheering from our foxholes was offset by the fact that every enemy was turned to rout. To us it was a miracle and blessing from above.”              Lt. Piet Visser during his service in the Korean War (1950-1953). He is one of only five surviving South African Korean War veterans. [SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         Temporary Captain Jan. A. Joubert, who led the operation, later received the Distinguished Flying Cross from the U.S. president.           Many of the South African fighter pilots were already decorated soldiers from World War II. Of the 826 in the No. 2 Squadron, 243 were Air Force officers, 545 were Air Force ground personnel and 38 were Army officers and others.           “It is estimated that 177 of the 243 officers who served in Korea had WWII experience,” Zenani N. Dlamini, ambassador of South Africa to Korea, wrote in a Sept. 14 email. “The majority of first pilots sent to Korea were highly decorated WWII fighter pilots.""             Names of first pilots dispatched to the Korean War, published in a newspaper in South Africa on Aug. 28, 1950. [SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         The pilots provided crucial support in holding back the Chinese and North Korean offensives as the war raged on, especially in the spring of 1952, according to the Korean Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.             “In his prologue to the publication titled ‘The Eternal Partnership: South Africa and Korea — A History of the Participation of the South African Forces in the Korean War,’ [...] then-ROK Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Park Sung-choon wrote that the squadron proved its worth in the spring of 1952 when they successfully blocked the Chinese Communist Army's general offensive at Imjin and the Han River and contributed to the lifting of the Koreans' morale by mounting their air-interdiction operations successfully in the enemy's rear,” wrote Dlamini. “During this period the enemy were subjected to repeated air attacks, despite low clouds with rain and snow storms.”           But the South African forces paid a heavy price as well. They lost 36 South Africans — 34 pilots and two ground crew members — during the war. Part of it had to do with their aircraft.           “The South Africans suffered heavy losses in aircraft over the period 1951 to 1952 due to enemy groundfire [both antiaircraft and small arms fire] while flying the propeller-driven North American F-51 Mustang,” Dlamini said. “The enemy aircraft, the Russian MiG-15 jet aircraft, was far superior to the propeller-driven Mustang as it was faster and could operate at a much higher altitude.”           Beginning in November 1950, the South Africans flew on F-51 Mustangs, until January 1953 when they started receiving the North American F-86 Sabre jets, according to the embassy.                 South African Air Force ground crew in front of a Sabre. [SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         The transformation, Visser said, was phenomenal.           “The entire 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing was equipped with the latest jet aircraft that was available at that stage, and it was very much a safer situation for us because when you fly the modern jet, you can get to […] 30,000 feet above ground, where the enemy cannot reach you so easily,” Visser said.             And the pilots had another significant issue with the Mustangs, Visser recalled.           “The Mustang had one very dangerous problem,” he said. “It used glycol to cool the engine, so if they shot a small hole into the cooling system, you had about two minutes to bail out, because if you didn’t, your aircraft would catch alight.”           By the end of the war, 74 out of South Africa’s 97 Mustangs and four out of its 22 Sabres were lost, according to the embassy. Many of their pilots went missing when the planes were shot down.             War stories rarely lend themselves to feel-good moments. But one event did lift the spirits of many South Africans near the end of the war.           “Second Lt. R. E. Gasson, a [No.] 2 Squadron pilot, [was on a] plane [when it] was shot down over enemy territory in January 1952,” Dlamini said.           His father, Fred Gasson, came to Korea in May 1952 upon hearing the news at his own expense. He waited for news every day, hoping to learn whether they had found his son’s remains or, better yet, that he was captured and alive.           “He returned to South Africa empty-handed seven months later,” Ambassador Dlamini said. “[But] Mr. Gasson and his wife never gave up hope that their son was still alive, hope that was proven correct five months later when it was announced in April 1953 that their son was to be repatriated together with other prisoners of war. You can just imagine their reunion when 2nd Lt. Gasson arrived back in South Africa in May 1953.”              A newspaper article details 2nd Lt. Gasson’s arrival in South Africa following his release from a POW camp in Korea. [SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE MUSEUM/ SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         Of the 36 South Africans who lost their lives during the war, 11 are buried in the United Nations Military Cemetery in Korea in Busan, according to the embassy. The remains of the 25 others have not yet been found.             Their return is still hoped for at home, said Dirk Louw, president of the South African Korean War Veterans Association.           “During a monthly UN Command Ambassadors’ Roundtable meeting in 2019 [...] Director of the ROK Ministry of National Defense Agency for KIA Recovery and Identification [Makri] gave a presentation on the repatriation efforts undertaken to date,” Louw wrote in the association’s monthly newsletter in July.             “He indicated that these efforts have so far resulted in over 9,000 sets of remains being unearthed since the recovery project started in 2000, with only 116 having been identified. He noted that Makri believes that some of the unidentified remains are not American or Korean, but from other sending states and therefore encouraged sending states to have families of those fallen soldiers who have not been accounted for yet to submit DNA samples which can be used to identify remains.”           The first batch of DNA samples have been collected and were submitted earlier this year for testing, Louw said.             “Finding the remains of missing pilots will bring closure to those families who have lost a dear one in the war,” he added.           Louw is a retired South African colonel. When the war broke out in Korea, he was not yet born. But growing up, the country was a regular part of conversation in his household.             “My father often made an effort to show us his Korean colored slides on an old projector,” Louw wrote in a Sept. 15 email interview. “The slide’s images were not very clear and he always had to enhance the slides with colorful explanations. He was very fond of the Korean people.”           Louw's father, Sergeant J.J.E. Louw, served in Korea from Sept. 4, 1952, to Nov. 12, 1953. He was one of the last South African Air Force members to leave Korea, the so-called “Bitter Einders.”              Sergeant J.J.E. Louw, second from left in second row in Korea in 1953. [SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         “The Afrikaans Word ‘Bitters Einders’ means those that have endured to the end,” Louw said.             Upon his return, Louw's father married Deleen Loubser in 1954. They had four sons, two of whom became career soldiers.           “As it is with young children, we did enjoy the slideshow but [never] really listened or understood his stories as this was something beyond our frame of reference at that time,” Dirk said. “The one thing that I could remember very clearly, was the effect that the fate of the orphans in Korea had on him. Every time he was talking about them he became very emotional and we did not understand why. Looking at the enhanced photographs I can understand.”              Korean orphans running along the fence of the K-55 air base, where South African forces were stationed, in a photo taken by Sgt. Louw. [SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         Dirk went on to serve in the South African Air Force, beginning in 1976. He retired in 2017.           “I did serve unknowingly with many of the Korean War veterans such as Lt. General Muller, Lt. General Earp, Brig. General Thom and many of the non-commissioned officers,” he said.                Col. Dirk Louw, son of Sgt.

[SOUTH AFRICAN KOREAN WAR VETERANS ASSOCIATION]         Dirk and his wife saw Korea for themselves years after the war, as had his father and mother.           “My father and mother were fortunate to visit Korea with the South African contingent in 1993,” he said. “My father told us upon his return that it can only be described as a miracle what happened in Korea after all these years. There was no trace of devastation he witnessed during the War. He and my mother could not express their gratitude enough for the way they were treated in Korea. They said that the friendliness and that gratitude of the Korean people were overwhelming.”               South Africa      A total of 826 South Africans served during the war, according to the UN Korean War Allies Association.

131,When settling for a studio apartment is too expensive,"

     Postings on the window of a real estate agency in Mapo District, western Seoul, on Sept. 22. The average jeonse price of a one-room apartment in Seoul that is smaller than 30 square meters (323 square feet) was about 162.5 million won ($139,000) in August, a 16 percent increase from January. [YONHAP]                A 28 year old was recently looking for a one-room apartment close to work in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul. His family lives in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, and he wanted a place that would reduce the commute. That plan fell through the second he walked through the door of the real estate agency on Sept. 19.           Earlier this year, he had visited the real estate agency in Dobong District, northern Seoul. Back then, the jeonse price for a 26-square-meter (279.9-square-foot) studio accommodation was about 90 million won ($76,900). In his recent visit, that same room was trading at about 130 million won, up almost 45 percent.             Under Korea’s jeonse system, a person puts down a large lump-sum deposit in order to live in a property for a fixed number of years. The deposit is refunded without interest at the end of the contract.             “I was about to sign a contract early this year, but postponed it when the Covid-19 pandemic got serious. I'm really confused,” he said. “I didn't take it seriously, nor did I think it would be my problem when people talked about rising real estate prices. I never imagined the price jump would affect one-room apartments as well.”              Many Koreans who can’t afford jeonse deposits are now turning to studio accommodations. The demand has been pushing jeonse prices of small rooms through the roof.             According to real estate brokerage app Dabang, the average jeonse price of a one-room accommodation in Seoul smaller than 30 square meters was about 162.5 million won in August, a 16 percent increase from January.             During the same period, the jeonse price of rooms sized between 45 to 60 square meters increased 7.6 percent to 210 million won.           The increase is most evident in Dobong District, where apartments have been relatively cheap.           The average jeonse price of an apartment smaller than 30 square meters in Dobong District was about 128.3 million won in August, a 57 percent increase compared to January.             During the same period, the average jeonse price of the same-sized room in Jungnang District, eastern Seoul increased 40 percent to 172.2 million won, while in Geumcheon District, southern Seoul, the price rose 25 percent to 162.7 million won. In Guro District, western Seoul, the price soared 24 percent to 139.6 million won.             The recent rise in jeonse prices of one-room apartments may be due to tenant protection laws passed in July. The law forces landlords to renew contracts and limits price increases.           Also, more homeowners are shifting from jeonse to monthly rent. The number of jeonse transactions of the tiny accommodations in August was only about 8,558, a 23 percent decline compared to last month.             Jeonse loans, which are a relatively easy option for tenants, are another driving force behind the price increases.             “As interest rates for jeonse loans are only about 2 percent a year, landlords who want to raise the jeonse prices are even suggesting tenants borrow money from banks,” said a real estate agent in Jungnang District, eastern Seoul.              Jeonse prices of officetels are also increasing at a rapid rate.             According to Sangga Jeongbo Research Center, officetel jeonse prices were 14.61 million won per pyeong in August, a 490,000 won jump in a month. A pyeong is 3.3 square meters.            “As government regulation on loans now also applies to people with only one apartment, demand for jeonse has been spiking recently,” Shim Gyo-eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University, said. “In order to cool down the jeonse real estate market, [the government] should approve deregulation on loans below 900 million won so that people who are really in need can purchase houses.”             BY CHOI HYUN-JU, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]                 "

[YONHAP]         A pending revision to the retail law to help traditional markets is causing panic among merchants at malls.      A total of 12 bills to revise the Distribution Industry Development Act are pending at the National Assembly. One of them would force malls and department stores to close during the Chuseok holidays and at least two Sundays per month.     Currently, only big supermarket chains such as Emart are subject to the mandatory closure. The government plans to add malls and department stores to the list.     “Closing malls won't save traditional markets,"" said Mr. Kim, 41, who runs a shoe store at the Starfield Hanam megamall in Gyeonggi. ""It'll just kill merchants operating stores here.""     Malls like Starfield rely heavily on weekend sales. They invest heavily in leisure activities to attract families on weekends. This is evident in the number of visitors: According to Shinsegae Property, Starfield's operator, the daily number of visitors to Starfield Hanam on Saturdays and Sundays was 90,000 to 100,000 in July and August, double the number on weekdays.      Lotte World Mall in Songpa District, southern Seoul, has 13 percent more visitors on weekends than on weekdays.     Due to their names, it's easy to regard these operations as big businesses. But more than 60 percent of Starfield Hanam and Lotte World Mall's stores are small individual brands who can't afford to lose weekend customers.      At Lotte Mall’s Suji branch in Yongin, Gyeonggi, more than 70 percent of all the stores are owned by small- and medium-sized companies.     Merchants complain that tighter regulations couldn't come at a worse time. The coronavirus has already made business difficult. Mr. Kim’s store, for example, saw monthly revenue drop to 60 million won ($51,000) after the pandemic — a huge drop from the monthly average of 100 million won before Covid-19.     “Closing the store on Sunday alone will cut sales by 30 to 40 percent,” Kim said. “If the bill passes the National Assembly, I'll have no choice but to lay off all employees except one. This will surely not be good for employment.""     Another businessman who runs hair salons at the Starfield Hanam, Central City Seoul in southern Seoul and a department store in Daegu, is considering shutting down his stores completely as a result of the government’s plan. His salons have been in the red since March.     Sundays account for 18 percent of his revenues. People who want relatively expensive beauty procedures such as perms or dye jobs usually visit over the weekend.     In hair salons, owners hire employees as regular workers and train them for two or three years. According to the owner, the monthly wage of a worker was only about 1.25 million won five years ago when he started his business, but rose to 1.79 million won this year due to rises in the minimum wage — a 43 percent increase.     “If sales drop, the first thing I consider is firing regular workers,” he said. “We pay tax; we work overnight to keep our business afloat. But who cares about individual business owners like us?     “If [the government] thinks supporting traditional markets is that important, they should impose more taxes on retail conglomerates and directly give money to owners in traditional markets,"" he added.     Retail companies are also in a panic. E-commerce operators have been growing at a rapid speed. Brick-and-mortar operations have been struggling after Covid-19 spread.     “Mandatory closures are unreasonable because shopping malls today are more like a place for leisure than shopping,” an anonymous source from one of the shopping complexes said. “The government should come up with a measure that can protect the business owners in traditional markets and in shopping malls at the same time, like forcing days off on week days instead of weekends.”     BY CHU IN-YOUNG, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]  "
133,Kim Jong-un sends rare apology for death of South Korean official,"

     Suh Hoon, South Korea’s director of the National Security Office in the Blue House, relays North Korea’s message about its recent killing of a South Korean official at a press briefing Friday. [YONHAP]         North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was quoted by Pyongyang’s inter-Korean agency Friday as saying he was “immensely sorry” for the “unexpected” killing of a South Korean fisheries official earlier this week.           Suh Hoon, South Korea’s director of the National Security Office in the Blue House, relayed the remarks to local reporters during a press briefing Friday, saying it was part of a message Seoul received earlier that day from the United Front Department, an organ in the North’s ruling Workers’ Party that deals with South-North ties.           Exactly how Seoul received the North Korean statement was unexplained.             It was the first time North Korea has ever spoken out about the incident, after South Korean military officials and President Moon Jae-in pressed the regime to offer an explanation.             South Korea’s military said Thursday they had intelligence indicating the South Korean official was killed and burned by the North at around 9:40 p.m. Tuesday after crossing the inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea, known in the South as the Northern Limit Line (NLL).           Exactly how and why the South Korean official ended up in the North is still a mystery, though Seoul military officials say they strongly believe he tried to defect to the North, which his family adamantly denies. Seoul military officials also said they think the North killed and burned him out of fear of coronavirus contagion.            The South Korean official has been identified as a 47-year-old who worked for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service.           In Friday’s message, the North said the South Korean official was “suspected” to have been fatally shot by North Korean soldiers after he was found in North Korean waters by fishermen, who reported the man to the North Korean military.           But the North denied that his body was burned.             North Korean soldiers were said to have fired around 10 shots “toward the illegal intruder” from 40 to 50 meters (131 to 164 feet) away in the sea after the South Korean refused to follow orders from them and at one point “hunkered down” on top of the “floating material” he was on, “acting as if he was about to wear something over his body.”           After the 10 shots were fired, the North Korean soldiers approached to within about 10 meters from the floating material, but the South Korean was no longer visible on top of the material, the North Korean message read.             “Many bloodstains” were said to have been found on the floating material. North Korean soldiers assumed he was dead and burned the material on nearby land, the message continued, without offering any further details about the body.           The North expressed “grave regret” toward the South Korean military for “groundlessly” accusing the North of brutality, but said it was “sorry” that such an unfortunate incident had happened in its waters.           Towards the end of the message, North Korean leader Kim, in a rare sign of contrition, was quoted as saying he was immensely sorry to President Moon and the South and North Korean people for “disappointing” them with the unexpected and unfortunate incident.           South Korea’s National Intelligence Service said later Friday that Kim appeared not to have given the order to fatally shoot the South Korean official.           While relaying the North’s latest message, National Security Director Suh also mentioned that Kim and Moon exchanged letters earlier this month before the killing.           Moon was said to have sent a letter to Kim on Sept. 8, to which Kim responded four days later. How the letters were exchanged was not revealed.           According to Suh, Moon told Kim that both Koreas were going through tough times this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, torrential rains and typhoons, and that he was rooting for the North to overcome the obstacles.             “Collapsed houses can be rebuilt, disconnected bridges can be reconnected and fallen rice plants can be set upright again, but people’s lives are an absolute value that cannot be restored and cannot be traded with anything else,” Moon said, adding it was pertinent to “protect the lives and safety of our 80 million people.”           Kim was quoted by Suh as responding he felt “brotherly love” from Moon’s consoling letter, and that he, too, would use “this opportunity to show unpretentious sincerity” to Moon and the South Korean people.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

135,Naver to stop ranking news stories by number of views,"

                           Naver unveiled its new layout for the news section on the mobile app, which will no longer have the list of ""most-viewed"" news. [NAVER]               Naver has decided to scrap the list of ""most-viewed"" news articles from its mobile app.          The portal site had been offering a list of the most-viewed news articles in different sections — politics, economy and society — based on the number of views or comments.            Instead, it will use an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to choose which articles are shown to users on the landing page. The company has been developing its news recommendation algorithm to consider qualitative standards like relevance, popularity and the viewing behavior of other users, rather than simply relying on numbers.           “The decision came as news consumption has been diversified and people are developing strong personal preferences for news brands,” said an uncredited post on Naver's official blog. “We will apply this to mobile news first and then reform the PC news service afterwards.”           After the overhaul takes place, news items that are the most widely viewed will not necessarily show up on every user’s newsfeed. Naver’s intention is to move away from showing the same lists to all of its users, regardless of their personal preference. The change is in line with Naver’s emphasis on ""diversification over concentration.”          In April, Naver changed news that appears on its landing page, prioritizing news from media outlets that the user has subscribed to. This won't change, but users will be able to access the AI-curated list with a simple swipe to the left.            “After we implemented the subscription and AI suggestion services, news consumption has become much more diverse,” said Naver.           According to the portal, the number of articles with more than 100,000 page views has gone down by 24 percent since the change. The company's analysis shows that page views are now spread across a wider range of articles instead of being focused on a few.           Naver is also removing a section from its main page which shows the most popular story in each section. Instead, it will show popular stories specific to different media outlets, randomly selected from the 71 media outlets Naver's news service is partnered with.          Naver believes this will be fairer to the media outlets offering articles to its platform, since they each now have a one in 71 chance of showing up on users’ mobile news feeds.           Naver is also reinforcing the customization of news feeds.           Users will be more frequently exposed to news articles from media outlets or individual journalists they subscribe to. The ""most-viewed"" rank will now apply to articles published by the same media outlet. For instance, for a subscriber to the Korea JoongAng Daily, a ranking of articles by the Korea JoongAng Daily will be available to the user.           Since October 2017, Naver has been displaying news on its landing page organized based on the media organizations that users subscribe to.           Naver plans to give more authority to individual journalists as well, allowing them to handpick the articles that are prioritized on their individual journalist page.           While Naver has been emphasizing its AI algorithm after a series of scandals over the manipulation of news stories rankings, it remains to be seen if the new system is actually better in terms of fairness and credibility.           BY SHIM SEO-HYUN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]               Related ArticleMachines haven't taken over yet, and that angers some"

137,"Level 2 restrictions, with few exceptions, to remain in place over Chuseok","

     In a Friday press briefing held at the Central Government Complex in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo announces measures to be imposed nationwide during the so-called Special Prevention Period from Sept. 28 to Oct. 11 in time for the Chuseok holidays. [YONHAP]         The entire country will be subject to many of the same restrictions as the Level 2 social distancing system from Sept. 28 to Oct. 11, central health authorities announced Friday.           But there are a few changes.           Public institutes such as museums and libraries, which were closed under Level 2 of the three-tier social distancing system, will reopen nationwide, though a limited number of people will be allowed to enter at a time.           Outside the greater Seoul area, clubs and bars that involve dancing and table-hopping will be forced to shut from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4, and local government offices, unlike before, won't be offered leeway to open them. From Oct. 5 to 11, each local government office will be able to decide whether to keep entertainment businesses closed in their area. Door-to-door sales businesses must stay closed from Sept. 28 to Oct. 11, during which local government offices cannot allow them to open.            In the greater Seoul area, the aforementioned places plus several other types of ""high-risk businesses"" — where people have higher risks of contracting the coronavirus due to their crowded environments — will remain shut until Oct. 11. They include noraebang (singing rooms), buffets and indoor fitness centers involving “intense” group exercises.             Eating in internet cafes will be allowed again nationwide, though minors still aren't allowed to use the facilities.           The other restrictions imposed nationwide until Oct. 11 are practically the same as those in the Level 2 social distancing system.           Indoor meetings involving 50 people or more and outdoor meetings involving 100 people or more will be banned, sports games will be held without spectators, and other businesses where people tend to keep a short distance from one another, such as theaters and coffee shops, must space out their customers and require them to wear face masks.           Central health authorities have declared a so-called Special Prevention Period from Sept. 28 to Oct. 11 as they brace for the Chuseok holidays, set to kick off next Wednesday. Concerned that people may spread the virus to their relatives and loved ones, officials have warned the public not to leave their homes this year, especially given the recent rise in daily coronavirus cases.            Korea added 114 new cases Thursday, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) announced Friday morning, down from 125 the day before.

     The National Museum of Korea closes its doors on Sunday after a staff worker was diagnosed with the coronavirus on Saturday. [NEWS1]               State-run cultural facilities will reopen their doors on Sept. 28, more than a month after closing due to a spike in Covid-19 cases in the greater Seoul area, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said Friday.           According to the culture ministry, 23 state-run museums and libraries as well as 11 performing arts facilities will reopen on Sept. 28, after ""thorough disinfection measures"" following guidelines laid out by the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters.            Museums and libraries to reopen include the National Museum of Korea, National Library of Korea, National Folk Museum and the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA). Performing arts facilities such as the National Theater of Korea, National Gugak Center and the Seoul Arts Center will also reopen on the same day.           However, the Gyeongju National Museum and the Jeju National Museum will remain closed at the discretion of the relevant local governments.           The facilities will only operate at 30 percent capacity to minimize any potential spread of the virus. Visitors will be asked to stay at least 2 meters (6 feet 7 inches) away from each other at museums and sit at least one seat away from each other at theaters.            Reservations can be made online on the facilities respective websites.

139,Ryu and Kim end seasons on a high note with wins on the same day,"

                           Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays throws a pitch during a game against the New York Yankees at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York on Thursday. [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]               For the first time in 15 years, two Korean major league pitchers have picked up wins on the same day.           Appearing on the mound simultaneously for the fourth and final time this season, Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals both picked up wins to finish their seasons on a high note on Thursday.            The two have been locked into the same rotation for more than a month now, but have never both managed to walk away with a win on the same day, until Thursday. The dual win follows in the footsteps of former major leaguers Park Chan-ho and Seo Jae-weong, the only pair of Korean pitchers to pick up wins on the same day back in 2005.          Ryu was first to secure his victory. Pitching against the New York Yankees at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, there were some concerns about how well he'd do as the 33-year-old has never really had a “good game” against the Yankees.            But on Thursday, it seemed as if Ryu was saving the best for last.            Ryu tossed seven scoreless innings against the Yankees to pick up his fifth win of the season and to help the Blue Jays advance to the postseason in the Wild Card slot.           Throughout seven innings, Ryu gave up five hits and two walks while striking out four. Seven innings is the most Ryu has pitched this season for the Blue Jays.            Once again, Ryu was well supported from the start of the game as the young Blue Jays scored a run in the second and third innings. The young squad added two more at the bottom of the sixth to carry that lead late into the game.           Ryu left the mound when the Blue Jays had a 4-0 lead. The bullpen continued their strong performance as they only allowed one run to the Yankees at the top of the eighth inning to pick up a 4-1 victory.            With another win, Ryu finished his shortened 60-game season with five wins and two losses with a 2.69 ERA.       Ryu's performance allowed the Blue Jays to clinch a Wild Card playoff spot, securing a postseason berth for the first time since 2016.     ""This is what I expected when I signed with the Blue Jays,"" Ryu was quoted as saying on the Blue Jays website. ""Even last year, with this young core group of guys and talent, I knew it would translate to this year as well. During Spring Training, I was able to witness their talent with my own two eyes, so I knew going to the postseason was a possibility. I like winning, and I came here to win.""      Ryu is expected to start in the first game of the Wild Card series, once they finish their season with a game against the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.        Ryu's first season with the Blue Jays has been a success, cementing his role as the club's ace pitcher. The final game, overcoming his old nemesis the Yankees, likely feels like the perfect way to cap off another strong season.          Before Thursday’s game, Ryu has faced the Yankees three times throughout his career and has struggled in all three games, picking up two losses and a no decision.            Thursday's seven scoreless innings has hopefully shut the door on that period in Ryu's pitching history.              Kim Kwang-hyun of the St.Louis Cardinals throws a pitch during a game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Busch Stadium in St. Louis on Thursday. [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]               Hours after Ryu’s victory, Kim also had another solid start for the Cardinals.            Pitching against the Milwaukee Brewers for his last game of the regular season, Kim got off to a strong start by tossing three scoreless innings.            The Cardinals were the first to take the lead by scoring a run at the bottom of the third but Kim gave up a run at the top of the fourth to tie the score.            The Cardinals fought back, wasting no time taking back the lead by adding two more runs at the bottom of the fourth. Thanks to the Cardinals’ batting lineup, Kim was given another shot at picking up his third win of the season.            And he made sure to do so.            By tossing a scoreless fifth inning, Kim left the mound with the Cardinals up 3-1. The bullpen continued the scoreless streak against the Brewers until the very last inning. Heading into the top of the ninth with the Cardinals holding a 4-1 lead, they faced their first serious struggle of the game.            Right when they thought the game was almost done, Cardinals pitcher Alex Reyes found himself with runners on first and second with only one out. The Cardinals lifted Reyes and substituted pitcher Andrew Miller, hoping to finish the game, but it took longer than expected.            Miller allowed a single to pinch hitter Eric Sogard to allow the Brewers to add a run. However, Miller quickly regrouped and struck out center fielder Avisali Garcia. Ending the game on a high, Miller struck out Brewer's All-Star Christian Yelich to end the inning.          With the victory, Kim was also able to secure his third win of the season. By giving up five hits, one run and two walks, while striking out three throughout five innings, Kim successfully picked up another win and will end the regular season with a 1.59 ERA.            Kim’s rookie season in the major league has been impressive. He started out in the bullpen and cemented his position as a starter mid-way through the season. Kim earned his shot as a starter after a number of Cardinals players tested positive for the coronavirus.            Although Kim briefly left the roster due to a kidney ailment, that didn’t affect his performance as he quickly made his return and rounded off the season with solid performances despite ongoing medical treatment and the need to wear additional uncomfortable protective gear.            Kim ends his rookie season with three wins, no losses and an ERA of 1.62.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]               "
140,SuperM discusses new album and becoming actual superheroes,"

     Boy band SuperM poses for photos prior to the online press conference held on Friday morning ahead of the release of its first full-length album ""Super One."" [SM ENTERTAINMENT]               A year after its debut, boy band SuperM is proud to bear the nickname K-pop Avengers and will even be releasing its very own Avengers comic book series in an official collaboration with Marvel Studios.           The group discussed the project as well as new album ""Super One"" in an online press conference immediately before the album drops on Friday afternoon.           “Super One” is the band’s first full-length album, following the release of the EP “SuperM ” when it debuted in October last year. A K-pop supergroup, SuperM brings together Taemin of SHINee, Kai and Baekhyun of Exo, Taeyong and Mark of NCT 127 and Lucas and Ten of WayV.           The creation of the group with members from existing bands came as a surprise at the time, although the debut EP quickly topped the Billboard 200 albums chart to prove that the concept worked. ""SuperM"" was the first debut record from an Asian group to top the Billboard 200, and also took the No. 1 spot on either other Billboard charts, including Artist 100 and Top Album Sales.            “We are a group with members that have all gone through different experiences and years of career,” said Taeyong. “And I believe that we are a coalition of different people who are able to show a different uniqueness as SuperM. There is chemistry and synergy within the members, and the fact that this new form of coalition was tried is innovative in itself. We promise to live up to the nickname K-pop Avengers with the best performances.”              SuperM's collaboration with Marvel Studios. [SM ENTERTAINMENT]               The group received the K-pop Avengers moniker when they debuted, but now they've truly earned it with a collaboration with Marvel Studios, home to the non-K-pop Avengers. A new comic book featuring the SuperM members as the main characters will be available as official merchandise, which the members say makes them feel proud and honored.           “I always pictured us as the image of the real Avengers, ever since [producer] Lee Soo-man introduced us as the K-pop Avengers upon our debut,” said Mark. “I am honored as a member of SuperM and also as an individual to be able to collaborate.”           The 15-track album “Super One"" includes the pre-released singles “Tiger Inside” and “100,” as well as the lead track “One,” which was also released earlier this week. While the members described the album as a chance for people to learn the new synergy and harmony the members have developed over the last year, the lead track “One” is actually symbolic of the merging of existing band members to form a new group, according to Swedish producer duo Moonshine.              Swedish producer duo Moonshine explain the track ""100."" [SM ENTERTAINMENT]               The duo, consisting of songwriters Ludwig and Jonathan, took part in SM Entertainment’s online song camp, through which they produced the tracks “Monster” and “Infinity.” After listening to the songs, they were asked by Lee to combine the songs together to create one — just like the members of SuperM were combined from different groups.           “We couldn’t layer the two songs with each other at first,” said Jonathan. “The transition was the hardest part, especially from the prechorus to the chorus. It took at a lot of works and a lot of versions of the song. We tried to make the blend as smooth as possible.”           “At last, we were able to come up with a song that we were happy with and SM Entertainment was happy with,"" said Ludwig. ""We are very proud of it and it may be one of the greatest songs we’ve ever written.”           This isn’t the first time SM Entertainment has created a hit by combining two completely different songs. SHINee’s 2014 hit “Sherlock” was created from the songs “Clue” and “Note.” Having already performed a song that was made up of two songs, Taemin urged listeners to listen to the two separate songs “Monster” and “Infinity” — which will be included on the album — after listening to “One,” to find the similarities and differences and enjoy the listening experience to the fullest.              Boy band SuperM poses for photos prior to the online press conference held on Friday morning for the release of its first full-length album ""Super One."" [SM ENTERTAINMENT]               “The two songs are very unique on their own,” said Taemin. “So they come together in a peculiar way that it seems like they don’t belong together, but they do at the same time. The synergy is very unique and it will be fun to listen to the songs separately to compare them.”           Earlier this year, SuperM became the first ever K-pop group to hold a paid online concert, kicking off a series of online concerts under the “Beyond LIVE” brand in April. The concert opened up the possibility that people around the world could enjoy music together at the same time, in the safety of their own homes but still connected to each other and the artists through the digital platform.           “We talked with the fans through video chats and felt like we were being cheered on through the individual videos of fans around the world,” Baekhyun said. “I thought face-to-face communication would be the only way people could interact, but it felt so good to be able to see fans from all around the world online and even get to see fans that we wouldn’t have. But I do hope that things will get better and we get to see everyone in person on stage.”           He added, “If we get to cheer people up even just a little with our music, then we will be content. I hope everyone will remember the messages of positivity.”           BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
141,Son Heung-min's hot streak continues with a goal and two assists,"

     Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur, left, celebrates with his Joe Hart and head coach Jose Mourinho after scoring the club's second goal of the match against Shkenjija during the third-round qualifying match at the UEFA Europa League at National Arena Todor Proeski in Skopje, North Macedonia on Thursday. [REUTERS/YONHAP]                Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur is on a roll.           After scoring four goals in an already legendary appearance in the English Premier League last week, Son was back at it during Spurs’ third-round qualifying match against Shkendija in the UEFA Europa League at National Arena Todor Proeski in Skopje, North Macedonia on Thursday, netting one and picking up two assists in a 3-1 victory.           Spurs got off to a strong start with Erik Lamela opening the scoring just five minutes into the match, assisted by Son. Finishing the first half of the match with Spurs up 1-0, Shkendija quickly responded in the second half as Valmir Nafiu scored an equalizer in the 55th minute.            “After their goal, we had to react,” Spurs head coach Jose Mourinho was quoted as saying on the club's website. “I reacted on the bench, the players reacted on the pitch and we scored two goals to win it.”           With the score tied, it was once again Son who broke the silence as he scored in the 70th minute. Then, just nine minutes later, Harry Kane cemented Spurs victory with the club’s third goal of the match, assisted by Son.            “It was a job done,” Mourinho was quoted as saying. “That’s the most important thing. Job done, no extra time, no extra 30 minutes that we don’t need and no injuries. It’s about that.”           The 2020-21 season may have just kicked off but Son seems to be off to the best start of his career, as he’s scored five goals in just the past two matches.            Son continued his scoring streak from Spurs’ recent Premier League match against Southampton, when he scored four.            The Southampton game was the very first time that Son has scored a hat-trick in a Premier League match and four goals allowed him to become the first-ever Korean footballer to achieve such a feat in the Premier League.            Although a bit less dramatic when it comes to scoring, Thursday’s match still proved Son’s worth on the pitch, as he was involved in all three goals.            With the assist for Kane's goal, the duo once again showed off their unrivalled chemistry. In the match against Southampton, Kane assisted all four of Son’s goals.            The two players’ teamwork has proven to be the best in the Premier League. Since August 2015, when Son joined Spurs, the two have teamed up on 24 Premier League goals, more than any other duo in the league over the same time period.            With Spurs’ 3-1 victory, they will now be advancing to the Europa League playoff, where they’ll be facing Israeli football club Maccabi Haifa.            “It’s not a moment for great performances,” Mourinho was quoted as saying. “The Bulgarian game or this one, no, it’s job done and now one less match, finally at home, to get into the group phase.”           Before Spurs return to the UEFA Europa League, the team will continue their season with a Premier League match against Newcastle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sept. 27.           In the Premier League standing this season, Spurs are ranked sixth with a win and a loss, totalling three points.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

144,Covid opens new realm of possibilities for music industry ,"

     Jaeson Ma, co-owner of Triller, gives a keynote speech under the title of ’Anticipating the Future of the Global Music Industry in the Post-Pandemic Era“ for 2020 MU:CON on Thursday. [KOCCA]               The future of music is digital and will continue to be even after the Covid-19 pandemic, co-owner of video-sharing platform Triller Jaeson Ma said on Thursday during an online conference held via YouTube for the 2020 MU:CON, organized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and held by the Korea Creative Content Agency (Kocca).           ""Crisis creates creativity and it forces us out of the old and into the new,"" Ma said, holding a keynote speech under the title ""Anticipating the Future of the Global Music Industry in the Post-Pandemic Era.""            ""I really believe we’re just completely going digital. We have to accept it. This is 2020. We’re not going backwards. Everything else in the past was the past. The world’s never going to be the same again. It’s not going to be like a year from now we say, ‘Hey, remember a year ago with the pandemic? Man, that was really crazy.’            ""No. This is going to be here for the next decade or more, meaning — whether it’s Covid or something else — we have to be prepared as human race. But it doesn’t mean we can stop making music, entertaining and getting that music and entertainment out to as many people as possible.""              Yoon Sang, singer and art director of 2020 MU:CON, gives an opening speech on Thursday. [KOCCA]               Ma explained that the current transition into the digital realm may seem temporary, but it signals a long-term and permanent move to the ""virtual world"" that we all reside in, where content is shared among everyone according to their taste and demographic, not according to place or time.            ""We are now on a new digital continent, not planet earth as we know it. We’re living a digital world... a digital continent,"" he said.            ""In fact, now that we’re in the pandemic, we’re going to be able to get [content] out to more people and reach everyone everywhere at any place and any time through the mobile phone, through a digital experience and through this new virtual world we live in.""           Consequently, it will be up to the individual platforms in the digital world to differentiate themselves from others to meet the specific needs of its audience, where targeting its set users becomes crucial. For instance, Triller offers a similar experience to TikTok, but targets an older demographic and also offers musicians a chance to earn money by getting their Triller streams counted on Apple Music's charting system.            ""I really believe that the future is music premium content, digital technology, distribution. And we’re going to see more and more collaborative ways of making music in the midst of Covid and being in your homes.

[YONHAP]               The Supreme Court on Thursday sentenced singers Jung Joon-young to five years in prison and Choi Jong-hoon to two years and six months in prison for raping unconscious women.           Jung and Choi lost their appeals of the verdict handed down by the Seoul Central District Court last November.           Three other defendants, one of whom is the older brother of the girl group Girls’ Generation’s Kwon Yu-ri, also lost their appeals and were found guilty of taking part in the sexual assaults with Jung and Choi. Their sentences ranged from an eight-month suspended sentence to a four-year prison term.           The court ruled “there is no illegitimacy in the original court’s decision regarding their crimes of rape and sexual assault.”           Jung and Choi were indicted for raping drunk unconscious women in Hongcheon County, Gangwon, in January 2016 and again in Daegu in March that year.           Jung was additionally indicted on charges of secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the videos 11 times in mobile chat rooms.           During the initial trial, the two claimed that some of the encounters were consensual, but the court ruled in favor of the victims and sentenced Jung and Choi to six and five years in prison, respectively.           The appeals court, however, reduced Choi’s sentence to two years and six months taking into consideration that he had reached a financial settlement with one of the victims.           BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "
146,Big business recoils at new legal legislation,"






     Sohn Kyung-shik, chairman at Korea Employers Federation (KEF), comes out of an office after meeting Kim Chong-in, an interim leader of the main opposition United Future Party at the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Wednesday. [YONHAP]               The government is facing mounting criticism over legislation containing new rules for companies, with business leaders squawking about how they will hurt local firms.           A day after Sohn Kyung-shik, chairman of the Korea Employers Federation (KEF), visited lawmakers at the National Assembly to express concerns about revisions to the Commercial Law and Fair Trade Act on Wednesday, the Justice Ministry announced new legislation designed to expand the legal scope of class-action suits and punitive damage awards.           On Tuesday, Park Yong-maan, chairman of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, made a visit to the National Assembly with the same agenda as Sohn.           As for the proposed legislation, one bill would extend compensation from a class-action suit with more than 50 plaintiffs to nonplaintiffs if those people have been similarly affected by a situation.           Another bill would make punitive damage claims easier. Current laws allow punitive damage suits if their products cause damages. The new bill will hold companies liable for actions or activities.           Companies could be sued for damages if they act “in an antisocial manner,” according to the legislation, which could include distribution of fake news.           Punitive damages are awarded to plaintiffs in addition to compensatory damages to punish a defendant for outrageous conduct. The new bill will allow punitive damages up to five times compensatory damages.           Big business circles consider the bills out of synch with modern times and dangerous to companies.           They say that even in the United States, a stronghold of such lawsuits, questions are being raised about class-action suits.           “The new rules are worrisome since they will increase uncertainties already highlighted by the coronavirus pandemic,” said Lee Kyung-sang, economic research chief at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.          “The bill for punitive damage would hold companies accountable for verifying that they didn’t commit irregularities, which is harsh on companies,” Lee said.           The class-action suit bill could be flawed too, some say.           “In principle, class-action suits are needed,” said Chang Young-soo, a professor at the Korea University School of Law.           “But what matters is how it can be implemented in a rational manner.”          BY KANG KWANG-WOO, PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
147,Some Chuseok social distancing restrictions could be 'tougher' than Level 2: Official,"

     A worker disinfects the fruit section of an agricultural wholesale market in Daejeon Thursday morning. [NEWS1]          Health authorities said Thursday that the so-called Special Prevention Period set to kick off next week in time for the Chuseok holidays might include ""tougher"" measures than those in the Level 2 social distancing system.           The warning came as the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said Thursday morning that Korea added 125 new virus cases Wednesday, higher than the 110 cases tallied on Tuesday.             Korea had managed to keep the daily figure below 100 on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.           Since last Sunday, health officials have warned of a new set of restrictions for the entire nation starting Sept. 28 and lasting through Oct. 11, calling those two weeks the Special Prevention Period.             The central government said it won't disclose details about the rules until Friday.             Yet in one vague hint offered during a press briefing Thursday at the Central Government Complex in Sejong City, Sohn Young-rae, an official at the Central Disaster Management Headquarters, said that some measures could be tougher than those in the Level 2 social distancing system, while some others “that are too tough” could be “modified.”           The entire nation is already under Level 2 measures in the three-tier social distancing system, with the rules set to last through Sunday midnight. Immediately after the Level 2 measures expire, the whole country will be subject to the Special Prevention Period rules.                              Sohn blamed increasing virus infections over the past two days on sporadic clusters in the Seoul metropolitan area and the fact that fewer people tend to get tested over the weekends, which normally leads to fewer positive test results through Tuesday. It takes about one or two days for a coronavirus test result to be confirmed.           Other than the Chuseok holidays, which kick off next Wednesday and last through Friday, health authorities are also concerned about a slew of big rallies planned by right-wing civic groups on Oct. 3, when Korea celebrates Foundation Day. President Moon Jae-in has threatened a stern legal response against anyone who protests on the street that day in large crowds, but many demonstrators say they won't budge.             The secretary general of one coalition of conservative civic groups told the JoongAng Ilbo Friday that it would go ahead and hold a rally on Oct. 3 in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, with more than 1,000 people, and would soon file an administrative suit asking a local court to strike down the police’s congregation ban on any demonstration in Seoul involving 10 people or more.           An anti-Moon rally held in Gwanghwamun on Aug. 15 Foundation Day drew some 20,000 people and led to at least 623 virus infections.           Among 125 people who were diagnosed with the virus Wednesday, 109 were local infections: 43 in Gyeonggi, 39 in Seoul, 10 in Incheon, seven in Busan, two each in Gangwon and North Gyeongsang and one each in Daegu, Daejeon, North Chungcheong, South Chungcheong, North Jeolla and South Gyeongsang.             Sixteen cases were imported: Six from Uzbekistan, three each from Turkey and the United States and one each from Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and Russia.           Five people died Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 393, while 182 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 20,832.

148,Moon and Suga have their first phone call,"

     President Moon Jae-in, left, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga had their first phone conversation on Thursday. [YONHAP]                In his first phone conversation with new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, President Moon Jae-in said the two countries should work together to find a resolution to the issue of Korean workers forced into labor during World War II, the Blue House said Thursday.           According to presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok, Moon and Suga had a 20-minute conversation starting at 11 a.m. Thursday. Suga took office last week.           “President Moon said the two countries should step up efforts based on a new attitude to resolve pending bilateral issues, including the forced labor issue,” Kang said. “Prime Minister Suga said he will encourage efforts to resolve the issues through talks.           “Moon, in particular, said the two countries have differences in their stances on the forced labor issue, but he hopes to find the best resolution that will satisfy both governments and all parties involved,” Kang said.           The Korean Supreme Court made a landmark ruling on Oct. 30, 2018, ordering Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal, renamed Nippon Steel last year, to pay 100 million won ($82,000) each to Korean victims of Japanese forced labor during World War II. It made a similar ruling on Nov. 29, 2018, against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The top court acknowledged the illegality of Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule and recognized that individual’s rights to compensation had not expired.           The Japanese companies have refused to comply, and plaintiffs began the process of seizing their assets in Korea. Tokyo maintains that all compensation issues related to colonial rule were resolved through a 1965 Korea-Japan claims settlement agreement.           Following their phone conversation, Suga briefed reporters about the call. “I told President Moon that we must not leave bilateral relations in the current serious state, such as the feud over the forced labor issue,” Suga was quoted as saying by Japanese media.           Suga told reporters he will continue to “strongly urge Korea to take appropriate action” based on Japan’s consistent position on how to settle the forced labor issue.           It was the first time the leaders of the two countries have spoken since a meeting between Moon and Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, in China in December 2019. Since taking over from Abe, who stepped down due to health problems, Suga had phone conversations with several world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. He is scheduled to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.           During their conversation, Moon and Suga agreed to work together to counter the Covid-19 crisis. Moon said he hoped the pandemic will stabilize so that the Tokyo Olympic Games can take place next year, Kang said.           According to Kang, Moon and Suga welcomed an upcoming arrangement between the two countries to ease entry restrictions on essential travelers such as businessmen. “They expressed anticipation that the special entry measures will serve as an opportunity to resume people-to-people exchanges between the countries and improve bilateral relations,” Kang said.             The two leaders also agreed to cooperate on Moon’s Korean Peninsula Peace Process concerning the denuclearization of North Korea, according to Kang. Suga also asked for Korea’s continuing support to resolve the issue of North Korea’s abductions of Japanese citizens, and Moon agreed to do so, Kang said.           According to a presidential aide, the phone call was arranged at the request of Moon.           During the talks, no discussion took place about Moon’s recent proposal that the two Koreas, Japan, China and Mongolia form a regional public health organization, although they did address cooperation on the coronavirus pandemic. Moon made the proposal in a videotaped United Nations General Assembly speech Tuesday.           The source also said no specific discussion took place on Japan’s export restrictions or other thorny issues. “They exchanged compressive opinions on various pending issues,” he said.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

[MMCA]               The online preview of a rare exhibition for dogs and their human companions will be uploaded on the YouTube channel of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) at 4 p.m. on Friday. Although the show, titled ""A Museum for All, a Museum for Dogs,"" is ready to open to the public at the national museum's Seoul branch in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul, the museum is closed indefinitely as Seoul remains at its Level 2 social distancing measures since the rebound of daily new Covid-19 cases.            An offline press preview for the exhibition, which features 20 works by 13 teams of artists, architects and landscape architects, was held on Monday. Two dogs, Sesang and Sedong, were invited to enjoy the exhibits. They are the companions of veterinarians Seol Chae-hyeon and Cho Kwang-min, who consulted on the show from its initial stages. First, the furry audience played with a variety of tools that artist Kim Yong-kwan developed and installed in the museum. The human audience will view the tools titled ""Beware, I Am Big and Non-dangerous!"" as abstract sculptures.           Sesang and Sedong then entered another room, where architect Kim Kyung-jae presents furniture and spaces specially designed for dogs. They are mainly in yellow and blue colors in consideration of the canine perspective characterized by red-green colorblindness. Sedong bravely climbed one of the furniture pieces and barked at the dogs in the film ""Can't Wait"" by artist Ellie Kyungran Heo, being screened on a nearby monitor.                Dogs Sedong, left, and Sesang walk on a hill installed by landscape architect Smooth Yoo as part of the ""A Museum for All, a Museum for Dogs"" exhibition at MMCA Seoul on Monday. [MOON SO-YOUNG]               Along the edges of the exhibition room are tiny hills and trees, which quickly caught the attention of the canines. They are part in ""The Forest for All"" by landscape architect Smooth Yoo, who intends to create ""ambivalent 'natureculture,' something that can never be completely humanized or remain as intact nature,"" according to Sung Yong-hee, curator of the exhibition.           ""Togo and Balto — A Group Sculpture of a Canine Hero Who Saved Humanity"" by artist Jung Yeon-doo was sniffed and licked, an unsurprising reaction considering the piece, which depicts two iconic sled dogs who transported diphtheria antitoxin across Alaska in 1925 to save children from an epidemic, is made of dog food.           Finally, the pair of pups played in the ""Dream of Dog,"" a group of white-, yellow- and blue-colored sculptures reminiscent of dog agility equipment, installed in the front yard of the museum. Its creator, Jogakscout, a collective of sculptors, intends the work to be ""a future forest for dogs,"" according to curator Sung.           The 3-year-old female Sesang was more cautious, while 1-year-old female Sedong was very active in enjoying the artworks. ""Sesang was rescued from a puppy mill and she had little chance to learn socialization before the rescue,"" veterinarian Cho explained. ""But she became much more lively and active after Sedong came from an ordinary family as her friend.""        Sedong plays with a piece by artist Kim Yongkwan during the preview of ""A Museum for All, a Museum for Dogs"" exhibition at MMCA Seoul on Monday. [MOON SO-YOUNG]                       There are also works for the human companions of dogs to enjoy such as a humorous animation by artist David Shrigley and the two-channel video ""Blind Walk"" by Hanne Nielsen and Birgit Johnsen.           ""Now, Korea has more and more spaces and establishments offering services for both people and their companion animals,"" curator Sung said. ""Amidst such change, this exhibition tests the boundary of the 'all' that a public space of the museum seeks to include. We experiment how far a museum, as a human-oriented construct, can be considerate of nonhuman entities.""            Unfortunately the exhibition is scheduled to wrap up on Oct. 25, and it remains uncertain whether the museum will be able to open its doors before then.

150,Bill creates new rental protections for small businesses,"

     A shuttered store in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul, with a sign seeking new tenants is pictured on Sept. 18 as the coronavirus continues to take a heavy toll on small shops. [YONHAP]               Lawmakers in the National Assembly overwhelmingly passed a series of reforms Thursday to protect small businesses from being evicted by their landlords as the coronavirus pandemic continues to contribute to a sluggish economy.           Already given a grace period of three months of overdue rent, businesses will now be allowed to delay those rent payments for a maximum of six months.           It passed the National Assembly with 224 lawmakers of the 252 in attendance voting in favor. Only eight voted against it.          The commercial rent legislation follows a similar bill, spearheaded by the ruling Democratic Party (DP), that strengthened protections for residential tenants.           The latest reform bill, as was the case for the residential rent reforms, has been criticized as impeding landlords' personal property rights.           Additionally, the new law also allows commercial renters to demand that landlords lower the rent under the condition of business being impacted from a viral disease spread.           The broader scope now gives renters more reasons to ask for reductions in their rent. While the law does not require landlords to accept those requests, it gives tenants more legal leverage if they end up going to court with their landlords.           The DP has argued that the new legislation will protect small businesses and self-employed workers that have been heavily affected by the resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic and the subsequent tightening of social distancing restrictions.             The ruling party and the government argue that landlords will not be financially affected in the case of late payment, as they can recoup the late payment from the tenant’s deposit.             On the issue of the lowering rents, the DP and the government argued that the landlords could raise the rent to its previous level once the coronavirus ends, and there is no limit as to how much the rent could be raised later on.             They denied reports that allowable rent hikes after the pandemic would likely be limited to 5 percent, similar to the maximum cap on rent hikes for housing rents under the legislation that was passed in July.           The government also stressed that various tax incentives were given to landlords who voluntarily lower the rents in the first half and that the National Assembly is currently working on changing the legislation to extend this benefit.           But critics argue that some of the landlords are also facing difficulties, as some of them purchased buildings or stores through loans, meaning that they are also under financial pressure.           The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) on Tuesday announced that they will bring the issue to constitutional court as the reform legislation violates personal property rights.           “The legislation of the Moon Jae-in government’s real estate policies have seriously violated the people’s basic rights,” said Song Seok-jun, a PPP lawmaker. “The government is meddling in people’s personal lives, which cannot happen in a free democratic country.”           According to the Small Enterprise and Marketing Service, 21,178 stores run by self-employed workers have closed between April and June due to Covid-19.           And the trend likely intensified after the government applied stricter social distancing due to the resurgence in mid-August, the situation is likely to get worse. In a survey the service conducted at the end of August on 3,415 small-store owners, 50.6 percent said they were considering closing their business.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
151,Moon gets creative with New Deal as funds are established,"

     President Moon Jae-in emphasizes the need to strengthen digital cultural and entertainment industries at an online exclusive performance center in Gimpo, Gyeonggi on Thursday. This is his fifth tour regarding the Korean New Deal agenda. [YONHAP]                Culture and entertainment companies are to be supported by a 35 billion won ($29.8 million) government Covid-19 fund next year in an effort to make up for creative output that was lost during the pandemic.              In addition, a 46 billion won fund for video programs and a 26 billion won fund investing in intellectual property for cultural and entertainment are to be formed.           The government will help create an online exclusive performance center, maximize the use of intellectual property appropriate for the digital environment, establish an online distribution platform for Korean cultural and entertainment and support state-of-the-art production technologies.             It also promised to expand the social security system, including allowing artists to subscribe to employment insurance.           “Digital society, which has been suddenly thrust upon us due to Covid-19, is a crisis that our society needs to overcome and also an opportunity for the content industry of expanding to overseas markets while breaking existing boundaries,” said President Moon Jae-in during his visit to Concert Studio CAMP1, an online exclusive performance stage in Gimpo, Gyeonggi, on Thursday.             He especially praised Korea's creative industries, including the outstanding movies like ""Parasite"", which snatched four Oscars including Best Picture, and BTS, whose latest song became the first K-pop track to debut No.1 on the Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart.            Moon emphasized the growing potential of non-contact cultural and entertainment industries.              “SM Entertainment’s success with online concerts and BTS's paid online concerts drawing more than 760,000 viewers show the potential for non-contact concerts,” Moon said.             “Thanks to the sharp increase in the exports of Korean games and webtoons, in the first half [of 2020] the balance on culture and art copyrights among the intellectual property trade balance reported a surplus,” Moon said.             The president stressed that strengthening the competitiveness of the digital content industry is key to Korea’s new future.           “This is the opportune time in raising our digital content industry’s competitiveness by combing our digital capacity with our cultural capacity represented by Hallyu,” Moon said. “It is our time to lead a warm digital era with our inclusiveness that puts people first.”             In the first half, while a $1.7 billion deficit was reported for industrial intellectual property, the copyright balance was in surplus by $1.04 billion.             The visit to the performance hall was part of Moon’s Korean New Deal tour, which kicked off in June.             It is his fifth tour. President Moon visited New Deal-related companies and promoted the so-called data dam, green energy, green smart schools and smart green industrial complexes.             Among the presenters on Thursday were KakaoPage CEO Lee Jin-soo, who talked about the success of webtoon intellectual property, and SM Entertainment CEO Chris Lee, who discussed the latest technology, including augmented reality (AR) used for K-pop concerts held online amid the pandemic.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]               "

They aim to roll out the hydrogen-fueled forklift to the public by 2023.             The hydrogen forklift is a medium-and large-sized machine that can lift up to five tons. When it is fully charged, it can be operated for five hours continuously. According to the company, it is the first hydrogen forklift of its size to be developed.             In the process of developing the forklift, Hyundai Mobis independently developed the “fuel cell power pack.” It is a system that integrates a fuel-cell stack, a high-voltage battery, a hydrogen tank and a cooling device. The company developed it as its existing system for automobiles cannot be applied to forklifts.           The hydrogen-powered forklift will be introduced at a demonstration event this year.             “Besides cars, hydrogen fuel cells can be applied to many different sectors,” a spokesperson for Hyundai Mobis said. “We will try harder to discover new business ideas utilizing the hydrogen fuel cells.”             The three companies are also working on hydrogen-powered excavators. They said it will be developed by the end of the year and commercialized by 2023.             Hyundai Mobis has been expending its hydrogen fuel cells-related business since 2017.             BY CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
154,"[SPONSORED REPORTS] Era of Urgency, a New Horizonfor Political Norms","

     A view of the Roundtable discussion on the Sept. 23. From left: Seo Sae-jong, a student participant from Kyung Hee University. Park Yong-Shin Yonsei University’s honorary professor. Kwon Gi-bung, rector of Kyung Hee Graduate Institute of Peace Studies. Song Jae-ryong Kyung Hee University professor. [KYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY]         The Peace BAR Festival 2020 took place from Sept. 22 to 23 in celebration of the International Day of Peace under the theme “Era of Urgency, a New Horizon for Political Norms.” Various renowned scholars and experts from across the globe, such as professor Naomi Oreskes (Harvard), Scott Sagan (Stanford) and G. John Ikenberry (Princeton/ES professor of Kyung Hee) participated. Due to Covid-19, this year’s ceremony was held online.Kyung Hee University and the  International Day of Peace          With Kyung Hee University’s founder, Choue Young-seek’s suggestion via the Costa Rican government and International Association of University Presidents in 1981, the International Day of Peace and International Year of Peace were unanimously set by the 157 member countries of the 36th United Nations general assembly in November of the same year. UN general assembly resolution 36/37 reads: “The International Day of Peace was set in hopes that every citizen of every nation can commemorate and foster the idea of peace, therefore encouraging all UN general assembly member countries and their affiliated corporations, local societies, and NGOs to remind what International Day of Peace stands for through educational means with UN’s help.” The UN designated the third Tuesday of every September (the 21st of September after 2011) and the year 1986 as the International Day of Peace and the International Year of Peace, respectively.           Since 1982, Kyung Hee University has been holding international academic conferences to celebrate the declaration of the International Day of Peace. After the name change in 2004, the Peace BAR Festival(PBF) succeeded the celebration with the new zeitgeist: making a “spiritually Beautiful, materially Affluent, and humanly Rewarding” society.           PBF 2020, commemorating the 39th annual International Day of Peace, aimed to discuss the upcoming threats humanity will have to face collectively, with the new theme: Era of Urgency, a New Horizon for Political Norms.                           Climate crisis, polarization and  Covid-19          The term “new normal” was coined after the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc, insinuating our past ways of living became a thing of history. But Covid-19 is not the first crisis humanity has had to face. The polarization of society and climate crisis has dogged civilization for years, but humans refused to change their lifestyles. Instead, the responses were division and conflict, such as the United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and Britain’s Brexit.           A sustainable future would be far out of reach even if a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. Climate crisis is what’s waiting, and it can only be addressed with international cooperation and collaboration between not only nations but also among citizen. Just as stemming the spread of Covid-19 required personal, and national efforts, collective efforts to overcome nationalism and revamp people’s ideas of cosmopolitanism can shift the balance of the world toward a better end.           This year’s PBF 2020 saw the participation of various scholars such as professor Oreskes and Sagan.           Naomi Oreskes is the recipient of the National Science Foundation’s Young Investigator Award, former consultant of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Her works, one of which was published by the renowned Science magazine and quoted in Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth,” fervently criticize modern capitalism and warn of our impending climate-bound doom.           Political science professor Scott Sagan from Stanford, an eminent expert in nuclear weaponry and national security, known for his research on nuclear weapons policy and nuclear disarmament, shared his insights on the venue. He had previously visited Korea in 2019 for the “International Conference on Nuclear Nonproliferation” to stress his thoughts on the matter.                           International Day of PeaceCommemoration and discussions          Along with this year’s theme, PBF 2020’s roundtable discussion mainly focused on “Crisis upon humanity and its solutions.”           The International Day of Peace celebration kicked off on Tuesday Sept. 22 with a congratulatory message from Irina Bokova, the former director-general of Unesco and the honorary rector of Kyung Hee Humanitas College. Her message was followed by a discussion with Naomi Oreskes (professor of the history of science at Harvard University), John Ikenberry (professor of international relations at Princeton University) and Ahn Byong-jin (professor of Kyung Hee Global Academy for Future Civilizations) who acted as a moderator. Commemorative remarks by Kyung Hee University System Chancellor Choue In-won followed. Participants discussed the imminent climate crisis and how important it is to change the current political systems and civil societies to face those challenges. “The 200 years of competitive capitalism have lessened hunger and disease, but they have not eliminated them. They brought us new problems. […] The urgent question is never what is the alternative, [but] how do you come to believe that a given alternative can be achieved,” said professor Oreskes.                           Roundtable with our newgenerations and scholars                On Wednesday Sept. 23, a roundtable discussion was held with eminent scholars and future generations under the topic: “Existential crisis and our lives’ grand turnover.” Rector Kwon Gi-bung, from the Graduate Institute of Peace Studies, took the role of chairperson for the discussion. Professor Scott Sagan, Yonsei University’s honorary professor Park Yong-Shin and professor Song Jae-ryong of Kyung Hee University participated as panelists as well as Kyung Hee student Seo Sae-jong who acted as a spokesperson for the future generation.           The roundtable discussion started with diagnosing the menaces facing today’s society. “Covid-19 pandemic, climate crisis and nuclear problems. Menaces are prevalent around, us but I do not believe these dangers we face will be everlasting. However, the real problem we have to take on is our deep-rooted distrust against our government, press and society as a whole,” said Professor Sagan.           Professor Park Yong-Shin agreed. “We have to accept that this is not a local but a global problem we face right now. Thus, we should not expect a certain group of professionals to suture our wounded world, or even thinking of falling into petty nationalism.” He also stressed that the current climate crisis is a burden every human has to share.           Professor Song Jae-ryong compared the current reality to the movie “The Perfect Storm.” In the movie, crew members of the ship did not give up the overloaded goods in hopes of a large profit, consequently sinking their ship in a storm before making any use of the precious goods. “Our greed is blinding us in this storm called capitalism. I see a lot of us in the crew members of the ship from the movie,” professor Song said.           Seo Sae-jong, a student participant from Kyung Hee University, suggested a different, microscopic view of the aftermath of this Covid-19 pandemic and environmental changes. According to a report from the World Bank last June, around 100 million people are projected to join the absolute poverty class, making the polarization of the world more severe than yesterday. “The benefits of the advancement of globalization and technology were not distributed evenly around the world. In the same vein, when man-made environmental changes approach, a lot of poor people will get hurt, more than those well-heeled ones. We need to come up with a way to help those people,” Seo said.                           Breakthrough by Education and Trust          After an energetic discussion, a consensus was made among participants that the current economic, social crisis was due to hardwired distrust within society.           As a solution, professor Park suggested a notion of a society of philosophers like Plato once adhered to. “We need to foster a society where every citizen could be a driver, a protagonist of the world, not just a mere spectator who delegates their rights to governmental representatives. In other words, we need to take people’s opinions into accounts when a certain law or plan directly affects a certain group of individuals,” he added.           Professor Song went one step further and said that developing a cosmopolitan and self-reflective citizen culture is what is needed. “Thanks to the advancement of technology, we find it easier than ever to gain access to various information and knowledge. Therefore, to reflect our globalized society and its hyper-connected information grid, we need to develop a new pedagogy model to teach our newly defined social responsibility as cosmopolitan society,” professor Song stated.           Participants then moved onto the subject of education. “Our current educational system is focused on a myopic view of human society. The higher form of education must inform students that our lives lie with humanity, not a single human society. Consilience is what this world needs to embrace,” Professor Park said.           “Kyung Hee University taught students values of humanity, nature, society and universe within its Humanitas College for the past 10 years. We tried to ask our students what our duty is as a citizen and a human being. This might seem alien to the common form of education, but we found it imperative to include those messages to teach students a critical viewpoint to the world we live in,” professor Song added.                 By Ahn Tae-lahm ahn.taelahm@joongang.co.kr   "
155,Life as CEO of an Esports team isn't just about the LoLs,"

     Joe Marsh, CEO of T1 [T1]                          When Esports was first introduced, it was seen by many as regular old computer gaming posing as a competitive sport.           But slowly Esports has made its way into the main stream — or at least close to it — even being included as a demonstration event at the 2018 Asian Games. Of the many games that are competed in competitive Esports, League of Legends (LoL) is perhaps the most popular of all.           Within that world, T1 is a household name. A dominant team in competitive LoL, the Korean Esports team counts Lee Sang-hyeok, better known as Faker, among its members.           As one of the very best Esports competitors in the world, Faker is perhaps the only pro gamer to have crossed over into regular celebrity culture, signing lucrative advertising agreements and becoming the face of Korean Esports.           But while Faker may be a well-known figure, little is really known about the people behind the scenes. Esports is a serious sport with all the officials and infrastructure that goes along with that. Whatever the critics might say, pro gamers aren't spotty teenagers in their parent's basement, they're serious athletes competing in professional teams with comprehensive front office staff, just like baseball and football clubs.           At T1, that behind-the-scenes control falls on two people: CEO Joe Marsh and COO John Kim.               Early adaptor          Marsh has been in the Esports industry long before it was ever called the Esports industry. He started out his career as an intern at Comcast Spectacor, the sports entertainment arm under Comcast Corporation in Philadelphia.           “I interned and never left,” Marsh says.           Having started out in the analytics department of the sales division and moving his way around different departments, it wasn’t until late 2017 that Marsh finally moved from more traditional sports to gaming.           “In late 2017, Comcast Spectacor bought an Overwatch franchise, the Philadelphia Fusion,” Marsh says.           Until the company bought the Philadelphia Fusion, Comcast Spectacor was known for its National Hockey League (NHL) team, the Philadelphia Flyers. With the hope of trying to build up the newly bought team, Marsh, one of the younger employees, was assigned to the project.           Working alongside Tucker Roberts, the president of the organization at the time, Marsh made his very first trip to Korea in March 2018.           And this is where the T1 story begins.               Arriving in Korea          When March and Roberts flew to Korea in 2018 they only had one thing in mind: Buying a League of Legends team.           “My first trip with Tucker to Korea was in March of 2018, where I met John Kim, who is now my COO,” Marsh says. “I got to have all these great meetings, and everyone’s saying the same thing: 'Great, thanks for coming, but if you’re really serious about coming to Korea, come back in October, when [the] Worlds is here.' Because it was 2018.”           Marsh took that voice and returned to Korea in October for the 2018 League of Legends World Championship, known as the Worlds. After flying into Incheon International Airport, Marsh remembers taking the KTX down to Busan.          “I remember going 200 miles an hour, great, perfect Wi-Fi the entire way,” Marsh said.           Having talked to a bunch of teams like Riot, Marsh says that ironically, the very last team he and Kim met was SK Telecom. The team, called SK Telecom T1 at the time, was already a strong competitor with a history of winning the world championship.           “They’re the best partner you can possibly have,” Marsh says. “The reason no one ever thought SK Telecom would [partner] with anyone is because they are a big company and we were talking with another big company in Comcast Spectacor and Comcast.”           Although it took almost a full year for the deal to be done, it was worth it, as T1 ended up backed by two huge companies: Comcast and SK Telecom.               A day in the life          Marsh may be the CEO of one of the top teams in a cutting-edge sport, but he's still a CEO. He spends most of his day taking phone calls, answering emails and running between meetings.           The front office at T1 may be different from the front offices in traditional sports in the sense that it’s smaller, but that doesn’t mean the work doesn't pile up. Most of the decisions are made by Marsh and Kim, who operate like executives in any other company with one huge exception: Marsh is based in the United States, but lives and works in Korea time.          “I don’t want to bother people and talk to them at midnight their time,” Marsh says.           Due to this, Marsh’s day normally starts at 2:30 or 3 a.m., as that’s when he can talk to his employees in Korea.             “Typically, because of the 13-hour time zone change, I’m trying to be on duty because that’s how I get to talk to everyone,” Marsh says.           Marsh says that he gets a little time to himself between 4 a.m. to 9 a.m., and that’s when he gets his work done. Since T1 is trying to expand globally, during the day, when his employees are asleep in Korea, Marsh has no time to rest as he still has calls and meetings to get through.           Despite his busy schedule, he says that he is fortunate to have Kim as COO of T1 as “he’s able to hold things down in Korea while I’m over in the States.”           While his normal day includes a lot of desk work, on game days, things are a little different. Also operating on Korea time, Marsh says the earliest match for him would be around 4 a.m. But of course there's a pre-match routine to get through first.          “[I] see the posting and check with John and stuff,” Marsh says. “Who’s playing, what’s the mood. And then I try not to tweet too much because on game days I get hyper-focused about what’s happening. I don’t want to jinx the team or say something dumb.”           During the match, Marsh says that he texts Kim and the board. However, as T1 has been the top team for years, Marsh says every game is important and stressful to watch.           “For us, every game is important, especially in League of Legends,” Marsh says. “When we get to the playoffs, even more. We have a legacy to uphold, fans that are very active and want us to do well. We're always working hard to achieve those goals for ourselves and the fans. Game days are stressful.”           Of the stressful moments throughout the game, Marsh says it’s the team fight that makes him the most nervous as it sometimes feels like a math problem.              Left: T1 CEO Joe Marsh takes photos with T1 players Teddy, left, and Faker, right. Right: T1’s League of Legends team compete at the 2020 LCK Summer League at the LoL PARK - LCK Arena in central Seoul. T1 finished the tournament in fourth place. [SCREEN CAPTURE, RIOT GAMES]              Active and involved          Having spent years working his way up from bottom of the industry to get to where he is now, Marsh isn't exactly the ""sit back and watch"" type of CEO.           Despite T1 having a dedicated social media team, Marsh is also very active on social media.           “I just think it’s really important there be kind of a face to the name and the fans not think that we’re like a soulless corporation, like they can feel connected to the [organization],” Marsh says. “Especially as you go global, it’s really important to have that connectivity with the fans.”           Marsh says that actively communicating with the fans even allowed him to pick up a few League of Legends tips.           In addition to the business aspect of becoming a friendly company, another reason behind Marsh’s activity on social media is his effort to protect the team.           “Like if [fans] want to have an outlet after we win or after we lose, I’d rather have that feedback come directly to me than to the players,” Marsh says. “I'm just trying to interact and engage. I stream like every other week with the fans. Just chat with them.”           While Marsh enjoys interacting with the fans, he admits there are highs and lows. This summer, T1 hasn’t played their best, finishing fourth in the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) Summer 2020 season. Of course, Marsh still believes in his team.           “Even if we’re not winning right now or whatever it is, I think we’re always going to get back to those winning ways,” Marsh says. “Just because of the infrastructure we have placed ourselves in our building. We invest heavily in our players and staff to give them all the tools necessary.”               Headquarters        The T1 organization has spent years planning their new headquarters in Seoul, currently under construction. The end result will focus on providing the best possible atmosphere for both the gamers and staff.           While many traditional sports fans may think that Esports lacks the physicality of other sports, Marsh really believes that it is “really about mind, body soul.” For this reason, T1 is building a fitness center so the players can concentrate on their off-screen fitness.           “Traditional sports found that many years ago,” Marsh says. “Nike and T1 are trying to bring that into gaming. It’s really important to take care of everything, not just how great you are at the game. You have to eat right. The guys are working out. They do a lot of yoga and stretching and those kind of body weight movements. Some of them are lifting, which is really cool to see. So we just want to give them every opportunity to keep growing as people.”           Along with the fitness center, Marsh made sure to include every possible feature in the building to make everyone feel at home. To do so, the construction is heading into its 10th month now, with the majority of the building finished between January and May. Of the many features, Marsh's favorite addition is the the heated floors on the players’ floor.           “A lot of love went into that building,” Marsh says. “My favorite is the heated floors on the players’ floors, so in the winter the boys are comfortable. Most of the time, they wear slippers or no shoes. We’re a shoe-free building anyway. It’s good to have some comfortable floors for them.”               Looking forward        For years, T1 has been Korea’s top Esports team, but only Korea’s. Marsh and his team are slowly working on expanding the company in the United States to make T1 a truly global organization.           T1 has managed to keep hold of Faker — who’s sort of like Lionel Messi, LeBron James and Christian Yelich rolled into one in the League of Legends world — despite lucrative offers from other leagues. But as a first-generation pro gamer, Faker may already be nearing retirement. The team has been actively looking to develop his successor, but it’s not all about the individual players.           “It’s not just about having the best individual player, it’s about how those five players can work together,” Marsh says. “That’s the most important part. You can have more skilled mechanical players than someone else, but if they’re not working as a team, you’re not going to win. It’s like a recipe, finding the right ingredients for the chance to win.”           Of course that doesn’t mean they aren’t thinking about the next Faker.           “Just know that we are investing in future athletes, especially in Korea,” Marsh says, although he’s not allowed to discuss specifics. “It’s really important to invest in that next generation. Not just in the sense of gaming. I’d like to be global in gaming and Esports.”           It’s important to find a great player, but Marsh believes that it’s even more important to teach them how to present themselves in public.           “Teaching them things other than just how to be good at games is really important,” Marsh says.             “How you look, how you present yourself, how you dress are really important. Who’s the next Faker? Finding that and cultivating that. There’ll be people similar to him, and hopefully they’re on T1. But for now, we are lucky to enjoy the one and only Faker.”           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

Institutions offloaded a net 154 billion won.           The Kospi dipped to its lowest level since Aug. 3.           Investor sentiment worsened due to dimming U.S. stimulus hopes and weaker-than-expected policy moves by the Federal Reserve, analysts said.           ""Investors seem to be disappointed by the latest FOMC meeting results, because it didn't signal concrete measures [to tackle the pandemic's fallout] that the market had expected,"" said SK Securities analyst Han Dae-hoon.           With Covid-19 flaring up again around the world, investor sentiment worsened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that economic recovery would take a considerable time.           In Seoul, most large caps closed lower.           Market bellwether Samsung Electronics lost 1.37 percent to 57,800 won, while No. 2 chipmaker SK hynix advanced 0.84 percent to 84,300 won.           Pharmaceutical firm Samsung Biologics sank 4.54 percent to 673,000 won, and Celltrion plummeted 6.02 percent to 250,000 won.           Internet portal Naver retreated 0.84 percent to 294,000 won, with its rival Kakao dipping 3.69 percent to 352,000 won.           Chemical maker LG Chem shed 3.02 percent to 611,000 won, and rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI sank 6.07 percent to 410,000 won.           Hyundai Motor declined 4.46 percent to 171,500 won, and steelmaker Posco lost 3.59 percent to 188,000 won.           The Kosdaq fell 36.5 points, or 4.33 percent, to close at 806.95.             The local currency closed at 1,172.7 won against the dollar, up 8.3 won from the previous session's close.           Bond prices, which move inversely to yields, closed mixed.

                  Covid-19 is weighing heavily on charities this Chuseok season, with funds drying up and volunteers slow to offer their services due to fear of the virus.           Chuseok, the Korean equivalent of Thanksgiving, falls next Thursday this year at a time of heightened vigilance over the possible further spread of the coronavirus.           The government has urged the nation to refrain from the Chuseok tradition of traveling to hometowns and meeting in large groups with relatives, in a bid to contain the virus.           Charity organizations said they worry the various virus-related restrictions will cause the poor and vulnerable to feel greater neglect.           ""One of our sponsors, who used to account for a large portion of all the funds we receive, recently told us they can't fund us any longer because of the difficulties their business is experiencing due to Covid-19,"" said Yoon Yoo-jeong, an official at a charity based in Anyang, Gyeonggi.           Yoon's organization helps homeless people and provides free meals to vulnerable social groups. She lamented that the number of people needing help has not changed, but funding and volunteer services continue to decline.           ""A little while ago we were asked to take back a charity box we had placed at a restaurant because the restaurant is closing permanently next month,"" Yoon said, adding that her organization is struggling to pay its staff's salaries.           In pre-Covid times, schools donated leftover food to the charity, but even that has stopped with many classes going online.           Yoon said her organization still plans to offer free meals during the Chuseok holiday that runs from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2.           As temperatures drop, there is a growing demand for coal briquettes, but ""briquette banks"" are seeing a dearth of supply, as well as workers.           ""Every September we used to get lots of calls asking for volunteer opportunities, but this year we've received one such call,"" said Shin Won-gyu, who heads a briquette bank in the central city of Daejeon. ""We also see very little donations of briquettes.""           More than 1,300 households in Daejeon still rely on coal briquettes for heat. Many of them live on hills and elevated areas that can't be accessed by car.            Typically dozens of volunteers stand in a line passing the briquettes from one person to the next until they reach the designated household.           But with the lack of volunteers, some briquette banks have had to pay delivery firms to do the job.           Special Chuseok programs are being canceled due to the virus.           Won Yong-cheol, the lead pastor at Bethel House, a Christian charity in Daejeon, said he has canceled annual programs involving jjokbang residents, or tiny rooms often found in shantytowns.           ""It's likely that more people will stay in jjokbang because of the government's guidelines against traveling to hometowns, and I'm afraid that without these programs it will feel lonelier,"" he said, noting that in past years, these residents were invited to go to public bathhouses together, share food and play the traditional game of yut.           At a nursing home in South Gyeongsang, workers said they are trying to find ways to comfort the elderly patients who will be without visiting family members over the holidays.           The provincial government said that as of Thursday, it had received only 4.8 percent of the Chuseok donation items it received during the same period last year.           Yonhap         "

160,"Fisheries official confirmed killed by North, burned","

     General Ahn Young-ho, head of operations for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirms on Thursday that a fisheries official who went missing Monday had been killed by North Koreans. [YONHAP]               A North Korean maritime patrol shot and killed a South Korean fisheries official who went missing this week, then burned his body and discarded the remains in the Yellow Sea, said Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense on Thursday.           Citing intelligence, a South Korean military official told reporters Thursday the fisheries official had apparently tried to defect and that the North Koreans seem to have killed him out of fear of coronavirus contagion.           A spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff condemned the killing of the 47-year-old official and demanded punishment of those responsible.           “We sternly warn that all responsibility for the brutal act committed towards our citizen lies solely with North Korea,” General Ahn Young-ho, head of operations at the JCS, said in a ministry briefing.           South Korea’s presidential office, the Blue House, also denounced the killing as an “act contrary to international norms and humanitarianism” that “cannot be justified with any reason,"" calling on Pyongyang to explain and apologize for the incident. President Moon Jae-in called on the North to take ""responsible measures"" for the incident, which he said could not be tolerated, according to his spokesman.            The South Korean official in question, who worked for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service, disappeared Monday from a monitoring boat with several colleagues around 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) off the coast of Small Yeonpyeong Island.           The colleagues became aware of his absence at 11:30 a.m. and reported him missing after discovering his shoes, prompting South Korean authorities to start a search operation at around 1:50 p.m. that afternoon.           According to a South Korean military official, a figure believed to be the missing civil servant was observed the next day atop flotsam in North Korean waters around 38 kilometers northwest of where he disappeared, wearing a life vest and looking haggard and exhausted.           A North Korean fisheries control boat approached the figure at around 3:40 p.m., and a person onboard the vessel — who was wearing a gas mask — exchanged dialogue with the castaway from a distance, the military official said.           Hours later, a North Korean patrol boat arrived and an individual on board shot and killed the South Korean official at around 9:40 p.m. The South’s military concluded the official’s body had been cremated sometime after 10:11 p.m. Tuesday, after a military surveillance device on Yeonpyeong Island detected light emanating from the area, the military official added.             “The North Korean patrol appears to have received orders to fire at the missing person, but we cannot determine who [gave the instructions],” the military official said, adding a North Korean soldier wearing a gas mask and a fireproof suit was seen burning the body with gasoline.           South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it lodged a written complaint to North Korea through the United Nations Command Wednesday afternoon, but that no reply had been received.             Pyongyang broke off all official communication with Seoul in June — followed by its unilateral demolition of the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong — so the South has few means by which to contact the North.             According to officials in Seoul, the North Korean patrol’s decision to shoot the official may have been prompted by heightened border security guidelines imposed as a result of Covid-19.             Pyongyang claims it has no confirmed virus cases, but the regime has been on high alert throughout the year, shutting down its borders with China and Russia. In July, a former defector to the South returned to the North by swimming across a narrow strait between the two countries, prompting the regime to shut down its border town of Kaesong in fear of Covid-19 contagion.           The regime’s state media at the time said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered serious punishment for military units that failed to detect the infiltration — a measure that appears to have raised the anxiety of maritime patrols on the western coast.           Various outlets, citing sources in the regime, have reported that orders are in place in border areas with China and Russia allowing guards to shoot on sight any person attempting to enter the country.           Whatever the North’s reasons for killing the official, the South Korean military’s explanation of this bizarre incident has generated more questions than answers.                        Defense officials could not provide a clear reason why the fisheries official intended to defect to the North, but said the facts that he left his shoes behind, used flotsam as a raft and apparently attempted to appeal his case to the North Koreans upon contact suggested his actions were intentional.           The family of the official, who had two children, denied he had any reason to attempt to defect to the North. One of his colleagues at the West Sea Fisheries Management Service also denied the possibility of defection in a phone call with the JoongAng Ilbo Thursday, saying the civil servant was a regular family man who showed no peculiar signs.           But another military official expressed confidence in the government’s conclusion, saying there were three or four pieces of evidence that could not be publicly disclosed at the moment. Another government source said the individual exhibited signs he was disillusioned with his life in South Korea.           Equally enigmatic was how the official managed to brave a sea crossing of 38 kilometers with practically no equipment, all the while evading patrols in one of the world’s most heavily scrutinized maritime borders in what is known in South Korea as the Northern Limit Line (NLL).              The Mugunghwa-10, a fisheries control boat that the deceased official was on board when he went missing on Monday, in waters just south of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. [NEWS1]               Even military officials were unsure as to whether the man swam or floated his way dozens of kilometers into North Korean waters or whether he arrived there atop the flotsam he was observed riding when he made contact with the North Koreans.           At the time of his disappearance, the fisheries official was aboard a 500-ton monitoring vessel that had departed from Mokpo, South Jeolla, that morning and was inspecting waters near South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Islands, located just 10 kilometers south of the NLL.           Though further investigation may illuminate the case further, the official’s death — which echoes the shooting of a South Korean tourist at Mount Kumgang in 2008 — is likely to strain already beleaguered inter-Korean relations even further.           South Korean presidential officials reportedly discussed a response to the killing as President Moon Jae-in was delivering his United Nations address on Tuesday, in which he called for the two Koreas to sign an end-of-war declaration to guarantee permanent peace on the peninsula.             As with the killing of tourist Park Wang-ja at the Mount Kumgang tourist area more than a decade ago, the North’s aggressiveness is inflaming public sentiment in South Korea.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
161,Colin Powell downplays threat from North at military conference ,"

Bush administration, on the right screen, and former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, on the left screen, talk about the 1950-53 Korean War and the future of the Korean Peninsula during a virtual military forum held Thursday at the Korea Military Academy (KMA) in Nowon District, northern Seoul. [PARK SANG-MOON]          Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said Thursday during a virtual military forum that South Korea and the United States should not be terrified of the North, saying that whenever he sees a photo of Pyongyang test-firing a missile on television, he “kind of smile[s] at it.”             The retired four-star general said Pyongyang would be committing “suicide” if it ever fires a missile at the United States — and “disappear” the next morning, which is why he doesn’t think the North would actually fire.             Another reason that the North wouldn’t fire, he continued, is China.           The “Chinese are not going to let this little country start another war in Northeast Asia,” he said, adding, “And so I’m confident that the Chinese would play a role in making sure that North Korea would not take aggressive actions that would result in a war in the region.”           Powell, who served as the top U.S. diplomat during the George W. Bush administration, relayed the remarks during a virtual military forum co-hosted by South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, the 70th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration Office at the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs and the Korea Military Academy (KMA).           The Hwarangdae International Symposium, normally held each year at the KMA’s campus in Nowon District, northern Seoul, was held virtually this time due to the coronavirus pandemic.             In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War, Powell was invited to speak at the first session of the forum Thursday alongside former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon about the devastating war, and the future that lies ahead for the peninsula.             Ban and a small crowd of cadets and military officials gathered at a makeshift studio on the KMA campus while complying with social distancing rules, as Powell attended virtually from abroad.             Looking back at his years serving as the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) from 1989 to 1993, Powell stressed the power of diplomacy and negotiation over military options, saying talking to others was more useful than putting them on notice that they’re in danger of being attacked.           “I had a monstrous military force behind me. I had more nuclear weapons than anybody. I had a larger force than anybody. I had everything necessary to take any country that I wanted to if that became necessary,” he said.             “But I didn’t use that very much. I found it more useful to sit down with somebody and say, ‘How are you? Let’s talk about things,’ and try to persuade them that there’s a better life for their country if they start to follow the right rules — economic rules, rules of democracy.”             Powell also noted he would not vote for U.S. President Donald Trump again in November, criticizing him for “moving away from all inter-agency, international organizations” and “taking some shots at South Korea because they’re not spending enough” for the hosting of American troops in the country.           “I think that’s all trivial and irrelevant compared to what South Korea does with that part of the world and keep it stable, but more importantly, what it has done for its own people,” he said.              Distinguished guests gather on stage after Ban’s discussion with Powell.

We need dialogue,” the former UN chief said. “I think our brothers and sisters and partners in North Korea should be more realistic. They should understand where and what kind of world they’re living in.

167,Pompeo expected to make October visit to Korea,"

     U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks in the Senate chamber of the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin, Wednesday, warning state Republican legislators of the risks of China. [AP/YONHAP]               U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to visit Korea next month, sources said Wednesday, during a critical juncture for Sino-U.S. tensions and uncertainty in the direction of North Korean denuclearization talks.             One government source said that Pompeo is expected to make a two-day trip starting Oct. 7, right after Korea’s five-day Chuseok holiday, which kicks off next Wednesday.             This would mark his first visit to Seoul in two years, as Pompeo last visited the country in October 2018, immediately after his fourth trip to Pyongyang.             If such a visit is arranged, Pompeo is likely to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, and make a courtesy call to President Moon Jae-in.             Pompeo, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), has played a key messenger role for U.S. President Donald Trump to Pyongyang since he was named the top U.S. diplomat in 2018. He made a secretive first trip to North Korea over the Easter weekend in early April 2018, which helped set in motion the first North-U.S. summit in Singapore on June 12 that year.             U.S. officials have pushed to expand the U.S.-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, involving its regional allies Australia, Japan and India, countries considered key to Washington’s Indo-Pacific Strategy aimed at containing China.           Pompeo during the trip may try to gain Seoul’s support amid rising Sino-U.S. rivalry over trade and security matters and push for South Korea to participate in such an expanded Quad structure.             Pompeo came down on the challenges posed by China, including in the telecommunication sector, at the Wisconsin State Capitol on Wednesday stressing the United States will build over time ""a system of services that we know we can rely upon that will have Western values, Western rule of law, a central understanding about transparency and openness.”           He had been asked by a state senator about the risks China’s investment in other countries pose to U.S. foreign and economic policy interests.            Pompeo noted the U.S.'s efforts to turn countries away from using the services of Chinese telecom giant Huawei by stressing political, military security and economic risks.           “Going out there and making sure everybody recognized the risk, has in fact led there to be big changes in how the world thinks about engaging with the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said.           Pompeo is also expected to travel to Tokyo and meet with Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK.           A Seoul Foreign Ministry official however said Thursday said that “nothing has been confirmed so far” on the timing of Pompeo’s potential visit.           While it is not expected that Pompeo will visit Pyongyang if he makes a trip to East Asia as planned, there will be interest to see what messaging he has for North Korea. The top U.S. envoy has continued to push for the regime’s final, fully verified denuclearization while stressing the door dialogue remain open.             Such a visit to the region could fall ahead of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10, which is usually marked by a massive military parade. It also comes just ahead of the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 3.             Seoul and Washington have not always seen eye-to-eye on the pace of inter-Korean cooperation. U.S. officials have often said that such initiatives need to happen in lockstep with progress toward denuclearization.             The U.S. State Department on Wednesday gave a lukewarm response to President Moon Jae-in’s push for a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War in his virtual address to the 75th United Nations General Assembly in New York.           “The United States and the Republic of Korea [ROK] coordinate closely on our efforts related to the DPRK, and we are committed to close coordination on our unified response to North Korea.” The DPRK is the acronym for the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.             Moon in his speech rallied support for an “era of reconciliation and prosperity through the end-of-war declaration” to “open the door to complete denuclearization and a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.""           However, U.S. experts have been skeptical of the feasibility of Moon’s proposal and its timeliness.           “I think normalization requires an end to the DPRK's nuclear weapons program and its return to the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty],"" Robert Gallucci, the chief U.S. negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994, told Voice of America (VOA) Wednesday.           Gallucci addressed the challenges of “sequencing” when talking about a formal end to the war, which could involve the process of lifting sanctions, disbanding of the North's nuclear weapons program and steps to address human rights concerns.             “All this suggests to some of us that the best way forward is step by step, rather than waiting to make some grand bargain,” he said. “If the formal step to end the war is taken alone, I would be concerned that the importance of the move would be lost.”           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

     [TONGBANG BOOKS]    Rage    AUTHOR : Bob Woodward       PUBLISHER : Simon & Schuster             Bob Woodward’s new book, ""Rage"", is an unprecedented and intimate tour de force of new reporting on the Trump presidency facing a global pandemic, economic disaster and racial unrest.     Woodward, the No. 1 international bestselling author of ""Fear: Trump in the White House"", has uncovered the precise moment the president was warned that the Covid-19 pandemic would be the biggest national security threat to his presidency. In dramatic detail, Woodward takes readers into the Oval Office as Trump’s head pops up when he is told in January 2020 that the pandemic could reach the scale of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed 675,000 Americans.     In 17 on-the-record interviews with Woodward over seven volatile months — an utterly vivid window into Trump’s mind — the president provides a self-portrait that is part denial and part combative interchange mixed with surprising moments of doubt as he glimpses the perils in the presidency and what he calls the “dynamite behind every door.”     At key decision points, ""Rage"" shows how Trump’s responses to the crises of 2020 were rooted in the instincts, habits and style he developed during his first three years as president.     Revisiting the earliest days of the Trump presidency, ""Rage"" reveals how Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats struggled to keep the country safe as the president dismantled any semblance of collegial national security decision-making.     ""Rage"" draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses as well as participants’ notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents.     Woodward obtained 25 never-seen personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who describes the bond between the two leaders as something out of a “fantasy film.”     Trump insists to Woodward he will triumph over Covid-19 and the economic calamity. “Don’t worry about it, Bob. Okay?” Trump told the author in July. “Don’t worry about it. We’ll get to do another book. You’ll find I was right.”                         [TONGBANG BOOKS]    Troubled Blood (A Cormoran Strike Novel, 5)    AUTHOR : Robert Galbraith       PUBLISHER : Mulholland Books             A breathtaking, labyrinthine epic, ""Troubled Blood"" is the fifth Strike and Robin novel and the most gripping and satisfying yet.     Private Detective Cormoran Strike is visiting his family in Cornwall when he is approached by a woman asking for help finding her mother, Margot Bamborough — who went missing in mysterious circumstances in 1974.     Strike has never tackled a cold case before, let alone one 40 years old. But despite the slim chance of success, he is intrigued and takes it on, adding to the long list of cases that he and his partner in the agency, Robin Ellacott, are currently working on. And Robin herself is also juggling a messy divorce and unwanted male attention, as well as battling her own feelings about Strike.     As Strike and Robin investigate Margot’s disappearance, they come up against a fiendishly complex case with leads that include tarot cards, a psychopathic serial killer and witnesses who cannot all be trusted. And they learn that even cases decades old can prove to be deadly.                           [TONGBANG BOOKS]    Caste (Oprah's Book Club): The Origins of Our Discontents      AUTHOR : Isabel Wilkerson     PUBLISHER : Random House             “As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power — which groups have it and which do not.”     In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.     Beyond race, class or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people— including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself and many others— she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their outcast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.     Beautifully written, original and revealing, ""Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents"" is an eye-opening story of people and history, and a reexamination of what lies under the surface of ordinary lives and of American life today.                          [TONGBANG BOOKS]  Shorter: Work Better, Smarter, and Less Here's How    AUTHOR : Alex Soojung-Kim Pang     PUBLISHER : PublicAffairs           You and your company can work less, be more productive and make time for what's really important.     The idea of success embraced by the global economy means being always on, never missing an opportunity and outworking your peers. But working ever-longer hours isn't sustainable for companies or individuals. Fatigue-induced mistakes, whether in the operating room or factory line, cost companies billions, and overwork alienates and burns out valuable employees.     But what if there is another way? Shorter tells the story of entrepreneurs and leaders all over the world who have discovered how to shrink the workweek without cutting salaries or sacrificing productivity or revenues. They show that by reducing distractions, eliminating inefficiencies and creating time for high-quality focus and collaboration, four-day workweeks can boost recruitment and retention, make leaders more thoughtful and companies more sustainable and improve work-life balance. Using design thinking, a business and product development process pioneered in Silicon Valley, futurist and consultant Alex Pang creates a step-by-step guide for readers to redesign their workdays.                                         "

They are reminiscent of the tradition of Ido chawan (tea bowls), which refer to the old Korean bowls from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) admired and used for Zen-style tea ceremonies in Japan in the 16th century. One of the Korean bowls, called Kizaemon Ido chawan, is now registered as a National Treasure of Japan.                Bowls by ceramic artist Kwon Dae-sup now on view at Park Ryu Sook Gallery in Seoul.

171,Conservative groups shift Foundation Day plans to drive-thru rally,"

     Leaders of conservative groups hold a press conference in front of the National Assembly on Thursday, saying they will not hold massive antigovernment rallies on National Foundation Day on Oct. 3. Instead, they announced a plan to hold a drive-thru rally.  [YONHAP]                Leading conservative activist groups on Thursday said they will alter their plans for a massive antigovernment protest in downtown Seoul, and instead hold a drive-thru rally to avoid potential blame for subsequent coronavirus infections.            A group of well-known conservative activists, including former Gyeonggi Gov. Kim Moon-soo and Pastor Suh Kyung-suk, held a press conference on Thursday to announce the change. The conservatives earlier had vowed to organize a rally near Gwanghwamun in central Seoul on National Foundation Day on Oct. 3, despite the government ban.             ""We will not hold a street gathering on Oct. 3 near Gwanghwamun,"" the civic group said in a statement. ""We urge other right-wing groups to join our position.""           By law, it's illegal to rally in large numbers in Seoul under the Seoul Metropolitan Government's ban on any congregations involving 10 or more people through Oct. 11. Police warned they would arrest anyone who participates in rallies exceeding that limit.           ""No matter how serious the Covid-19 outbreak is, we must still express our rage toward the Moon Jae-in administration's evil deeds and faults,"" the statement said. ""We believe holding a car parade is the only way to express our voices without falling into the trap of the government.""             Earlier this month, Suh's group applied for permission to hold a drive-thru rally on Oct. 3 in central Seoul. Suh said over 200 cars will march from Yeouido, western Seoul, to Seocho Police Station through Gwanghwamun from 1 to 5 p.m.             ""Because the authorities banned drive-thru rallies with more than 10 cars, we will march in groups of nine cars,"" Kim said.             Some activists maintained that they will hold rallies as planned, dismissing the drive-thru protest plan. The group, which includes the controversial Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, who was the one of organizers of the Aug. 15 Liberation Day rally, and his followers of the Sarang Jeil Church has been blamed for the resurgence of infections.                Streets of central Seoul near Gwanghwamun are filled with antigovernment protesters on Aug. 15, 2020.  [YONHAP]                The group said it will invite more than 1,000 people to the Oct. 3 rally. Choi In-sik, a leader of the group, told local media on Thursday, that he will file a lawsuit with a local administrative court to challenge the government ban.             According to the police, it received 835 applications to hold rallies in downtown Seoul on National Foundation Day. The police said they rejected 112 plans including many events that planned to invite more than 10.             Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said Thursday that the government will enforce its ban on drive-through rallies.             In a meeting with senior members of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), government and the Blue House, Chung said no rallies will be allowed on the National Foundation Day.             ""Some people said they want to hold rallies at the Gwanghwamun,"" Chung said. ""They are also precious citizens of our country, but the government has made clear that no rallies on the National Foundation Day will be allowed near Gwanghwamun. No matter what their reasons are, and no matter what methods they will use, we won't allow Gwanghwamun rallies.""             ""Anyone who does not respect the law will be held accountable,"" he said.           Politicians are split on the idea of drive-thru rallies.             Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the conservative opposition People Power Party (PPP), said Wednesday that the activists have the right to hold drive-thru rallies as long as they don't disturb traffic and violate disease control measures.       Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung, an influential ruling party politician, also said freedom of expression, if it does not harm the disease control measures, must be allowed. His position notably differed from many DP politicians' strong condemnations toward the conservative groups' plan to hold drive-thru rallies.           ""There can be many ways to hold rallies,"" Lee said in his interview with CBS Radio. ""If the methods minimized the risk of infections, there is no need to limit freedom of expression,"" he said.             Some conservative politicians have expressed concerns that they will face yet more public blame. The PPP has repeatedly stressed that it will not take part in the Liberation Day rallies. Its acting leader, Kim Chong-in, asked the party members to refrain from attending the events.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "

     General Ahn Young-ho, head of operations at South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday confirms a fisheries official who went missing on Monday had been killed by the North Koreans. [YONHAP]               A North Korean maritime patrol shot and killed a South Korean government fisheries official who went missing in the Yellow Sea this week and then burned his body, said Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense on Thursday.           Citing intelligence, a South Korean military official told reporters Thursday the fisheries official had apparently tried to defect and that the North Koreans seem to have killed him out of fear of a coronavirus contagion.           A spokesman for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff condemned the killing of the 47-year-old official by Pyongyang and demanded punishment of those responsible.           “We sternly warn that all responsibility for the brutal act committed towards our citizen lies solely with North Korea,” General Ahn Young-ho, head of operations at the JCS, said in a ministry briefing.           The South Korean official in question, who worked for the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries’ West Sea Fisheries Management Service, disappeared Monday from a monitoring boat with several colleagues around 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) off the coast of Small Yeonpyeong Island. The colleagues became aware of his absence at 11:30 a.m.           They reported him missing after discovering his shoes, prompting South Korean authorities to scramble a search operation at around 1:50 p.m. that afternoon.           According to a South Korean military official, a figure believed to be the missing civil servant was observed the next day atop flotsam in North Korean waters around 38 kilometers northwest of where he disappeared, wearing a life vest and looking haggard and exhausted.           A North Korean fisheries control boat approached the figure at around 3:40 p.m., and a person onboard the vessel — who was wearing a gas mask — exchanged dialogue with the castaway from a distance, the military official said.           Hours later, a North Korean patrol boat arrived and an individual on board shot and killed the South Korean official at around 9:40 p.m. The South’s military concluded the official’s body had been cremated sometime after 10:11 p.m. Tuesday, after a military surveillance device on Yeonpyeong Island detected light emanating from the area, the military official added.             “The North Korean patrol appears to have received orders to fire at the missing person, but we cannot determine who [gave the instructions],” the military official said, adding a North Korean soldier wearing a gas mask and a fireproof suit was seen burning the body with gasoline.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

[SCREEN CAPTURE]               ""I found again the people I love — the other members, my family, my friends,"" he said. ""I found the music I love, and I found myself. Thinking about the future and trying hard are all important. But cherishing yourself, encouraging yourself and keeping yourself happy is the most important. In a world of uncertainty, we must cherish the importance of 'me,' 'you' and 'us.'""           ""Our tomorrow may be dark, painful and difficult,"" said RM. ""We might stumble or fall down. But the stars shine brightest when the night is darkest. If the stars are hidden, we’ll let moonlight guide us. If even the moon is dark, let our faces be the light that helps us find our way. Let’s reimagine our world. We’re huddled together tired, but let’s dream again.""           BTS ended the speech with each member saying, ""Life goes on.""            This is the second time for the band to speak at the UN General Assembly. They gave a speech at Unicef's Generation Unlimited program at the 73rd General Assembly held in 2018, sharing a message of antiviolence through their ""Love Myself"" campaign.            BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]    "
174,Kwak Hyun-hwa wins civil case over nude scene,"

     Actor Kwak Hyun-hwa, left, and director Lee Soo-sung. [JOONGANG ILBO]                Actor and comedian Kwak Hyun-hwa won damages from director Lee Soo-sung for having released a scene in a film that showed Kwak’s breasts without her consent.           On Thursday, the Seoul Central District Court ordered Lee to pay Kwak 20 million won ($16,900). She had sued Lee for 100 million won.           After Kwak agreed to appear in the 2012 film “House with a Good View,"" Lee verbally agreed to not film scenes that exposed Kwak's breasts. During filming, however, Lee persuaded Kwak that a partially nude scene “was necessary for the narrative.” Kwak agreed on the condition that she could decide whether the scene could be used in the film.           She decided it shouldn't, and it wasn't in the theatrical release in 2012. The scene was restored when the film was released on IPTV and file-sharing services.           Kwak sued Lee for 100 million won: 30 million won for releasing the scene without her consent and 70 million for her mental suffering.           “Lee infringed upon Kwak’s privacy by releasing a scene that exposes her chest without her consent, which [could] be sexually humiliating,” the court ruled. It cited a phone conversation in which Lee acknowledged he needed Kwak’s consent for the scene to be released.           The court pointed out that the film with the nude scene is still being illegally distributed, causing pain to Lee.           Kwak filed a criminal complaint against Lee in 2016 and he was indicted for violating the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc, on Sexual Crimes. The Supreme Court acquitted him in 2018.           “I won the lawsuit. Thank you for supporting me,” Kwak wrote on Twitter.           BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "

176,[SPONSORED REPORTS] Hyundai Card pioneers online approach amid Covid,"

                   The credit card industry has not escaped the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. With social distancing measures common place and the “new normal” being defined by “untact” practices, corporations from myriad industries are finding it necessary to improvise, adapt and overcome the current hostile and unprecedented circumstances.Therefore it comes as no surprise that Hyundai Card’s recent online LAN meeting with customers and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) enthralled many. Hyundai Card’s “Online customer panel conference,” which took place on July 29, was the first online customer meeting held in the card business field in Korea. Unbounded by a time limit or physical venue, the meeting engendered fervent reactions from customers, especially those from outside the Seoul metropolitan area. Thanks to the remote meeting, various responses from all around the country were heard including numerous complaints, concerns and solutions.“It is obvious that Covid-19 will alter the landscape of financial services, sooner rather than later. It was an eye-opening experience for me to see how virtual meetings with customers can be beneficial to our services,” an official from the FSS said.Hyundai Card’s online customer outreach is not limited to virtual conferences. By using real-time text messaging and other channels, Hyundai Card is accumulating more than 300,000 customer responses each year.With this substantial customer data, Hyundai Card established its product development system. Before launching new card services and products, the product committee is assembled, comprised of the product development department, internal control department, consumer protection department and many more. In this process, if a problem arises, development is halted immediately. Hyundai Card also recently launched pre-emptive customer care services with its consumer protection department. By analyzing the ongoing government’s policymaking and economic indicators and offering consultation to its users, Hyundai Card aims to remain vigilant in customer care in this intricate, fluctuating market.Digitalized procedures were also introduced to promote fast response times and personal information protection. Hyundai Card was the first in the card industry to implement an artificial intelligence (AI) automated response system as part of its customer care system, shortening the time between each customer’s calls and enabling counselors to be more focused. In addition, Hyundai Card’s AI system is also being implemented to deal with the fraud detection system for credit card thefts, proving its versatility.Hyundai Card’s pioneering online approach, data management and AI implementation are catching people’s eyes not only in card businesses but also in the finance industry. “Our next goal is to define the correlation between customers’ behaviors and complaints by using our customer data. Analyzing what situation causes customer’s certain discomfort will help us deal with future complaints,” said the official from Hyundai Card.By Ahn Tae-lahm [ahn.taelahm@joongang.co.kr]   "
177,Chaebol heads talk shop at closed-door dinner,"

     SK Chairman Chey Tae-won, left, and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung shake hands at SK Innovation's factory in Osan, South Chungcheong, in July. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               The heads of four of Korea's most influential chaebol — Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor and LG — reportedly met earlier this month to discuss possible areas of cooperation and ways to navigate the tough business environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.           The closed-door meeting brought together Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, SK Chairman Chey Tae-won, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung and LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo.           “The gathering, including a meal, was intended as a way to share thoughts about current issues,” said a source with knowledge of the matter.           The meeting marks the first time the four business leaders have come together since January, when they all attended a New Year’s event hosted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry.           The gathering isn't entirely unheard of — according to sources, the four, along with Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, meet relatively regularly to discuss business issues. Shin did not attend this month as he is currently in Japan.           “They agreed that the remaining half of this year will be tougher than the first half,” the source said, “and talked about making a concerted effort to overcome the challenges.”          Chaebol are far from being insulated from the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.           Key affiliates from 11 out of the 15 largest companies in Korea reported lower revenues in the first half of this year compared to the same period over a year ago.           The focus of the discussion was to come with a coordinated response toward the economy impacted by the pandemic and a series of government regulations seen to burden major conglomerates.              Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung, left, shakes hands with LG Chairman Koo Kwang-mo at LG Chem's factory in Ochang, North Chungcheong, in June. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               Growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) and rechargeable batteries also acted as a reason for the business heavyweights to meet.             “There was a consensus surrounding [EV] batteries,” the source said, “They are believed to have discussed the prospects of the [EV] business.”           The direction is in line with the focus of a series of one-on-one meetings among the four this year.           In the first half of this year, Chung made a visit to manufacturing plants of all three battery makers — LG Chem, SK Innovation and Samsung SDI — to be briefed about each company's core technologies.           LG’s Koo and Chey from SK also met twice this year.            The source said that the issue of a legal dispute between SK Innovation and LG Chem over battery patents was not brought up at the latest meeting.           The rechargeable battery market is growing rapidly, buoyed by the push toward renewable energy.           “The related market for energy storage systems will expand at an accelerated pace after 2023, which will coincide with the declining price of rechargeable batteries,” said Park Yeon-joo, an analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo.             Other insiders said that they also touched upon a set of pending regulations aimed at enhancing fair trade, an initiative blamed by businesses for burdening companies.           BY KANG GI-HEON, PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

181,I've got two words for you: Biodegradable plastic,"

     An employee of a waste-sorting firm separates the accumulated waste with an excavator at a recycling center inside a park in Songpa District, southern Seoul. [NEWS1]               Waste from packaging — plastic, vinyl and Styrofoam — is overwhelming the environment as delivery booms in the age of Covid-19.           It's known as ""white pollution.""           Calls are growing for eco-friendly alternatives, such as biodegradable plastic. In response, chemical and manufacturing firms have started to research the market for biodegradable plastics.             According to Statistics Korea on Tuesday, the cumulative turnover for online food delivery in the January-July period was 8.66 trillion won ($7.43 billion), a 73.6 percent on-year increase.           Household waste from delivered goods, such as plastic and vinyl, has been rapidly mounting as well. The Ministry of Environment announced that a daily average of 850 tons of plastic waste was generated in the first half of the year, a 16 percent on-year increase.             The recycling rate for plastic is low. A significant proportion of plastic waste is stained with food and other substances, and hence it is burnt and used as fuel. Estimates put the genuine recycling rate at under 10 percent.             “The recycling rate for plastic in Korea is around 10 percent, but the production rate of plastic has surpassed the recycling rate at a faster speed. Recycling is not enough for waste reduction,” said Hwang Sung-yeon, head of the biochemical research center at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (Krict).           “It is hard to impose strict regulations against the use of disposable items in the coronavirus era. The time has come to proactively consider alternative sources that biodegrade when buried in the ground.”           An alternative material discussed globally is biodegradable plastic, which belongs to the bioplastics group.           Bioplastics is divided into two groups: biodegradable plastic, which decomposes, and biobased plastic, which does not decompose but is made of natural ingredients, such as corn and sugarcane.           The thin vinyl that wraps Starbucks bananas is made with polylactic acid (PLA), which is biodegradable plastic manufactured in the United States. German chemical company BASF made agricultural vinyl that decomposes underground in three to four months. It is used in the farmlands of South Jeolla, Gangwon, North Chungcheong and Gyeonggi.             As the volume of parcel delivery is at an all-time high during the coronavirus pandemic, the waste from packaged goods is a major source of white pollution.           Based on the decomposition process and use, biodegradable plastics are industrial or household. Industrial biodegradable plastic requires composting equipment that operates only under certain conditions, but the household kind naturally decomposes on its own after six to 24 months.             Some developed countries are actively developing plastic that 90 percent biodegrades on land or in the ocean within six months. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is one example. According to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, 80 percent of ocean waste worldwide is plastic, which includes vinyl, and microplastics have become a threat to humanity.           The Institute for International Trade predicts that the market for biodegradable plastic will grow 15.1 percent per year to $6.1 billion in 2023 from $3 billion in 2018. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the growth curve is expected to become steeper.           Local companies that have already begun research into biodegradable plastic possess technology, but they cannot easily enter the market because of the Ministry of Environment’s policy that only recognizes industrial-type biodegradable plastic. The industrial-type biodegrades at 58 degrees Celsius (136 degrees Fahrenheit) and in an environment with specific compost and microorganisms. Even if firms want to develop plastic that decomposes in other natural surroundings, such as on farmland and in the ocean, currently there is no category for it.             The certification process by the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (Keiti) under the Ministry of Environment is also complex. Without a factory site dedicated to the manufacturing of biodegradable plastic, firms cannot apply for certification even if the product is developed at a research center.           “In countries like the United States, Germany and Japan, several private institutions certify biodegradable plastic based on components after a review of samples,” said a biotechnological industry expert who wished to remain anonymous. “In Korea, there are three to four times more documents that need to be submitted, and the process also takes almost twice as long.”             “Currently, there is only one category of biodegradable plastic because it is most common, and the domestic market is relatively new,” said a spokesperson of Keiti. “Keiti is examining measures for creating more categories for biodegradable plastic.”           The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy has selected biodegradable plastic as one of the project areas for its Green New Deal, which is part of the Korean New Deal intended to speed economic recovery.           “A set of measures will be announced in October for white biotechnology, including biodegradable plastic and others,” said a spokesperson for the Energy Ministry. “A basic principle is ensuring that there are no obstacles hindering corporations from entering the market.”           BY LEE SO-AH   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
182,"Stats show a dearth of cheap digs, politician claims","

     Postings on the window of a real estate agency in downtown Seoul show the apartment offerings in the area. The Korea Appraisal Board reported in August a 57 percent decrease in apartment transactions compared to July. [NEWS 1]                Affordable housing in Seoul is on a decline since the beginning of the Moon Jae-in administration, an opposition politician claims.           According to analysis by Rep. Kim Sang-hoon of the Korea Appraisal Board, the share of all apartments priced 600 million won ($515,388) or below is now less than the share of those priced above 900 million won, the exact opposite of the situation before the Moon administration started.           When the administration took office in May 2017, 67 percent of Seoul’s apartments were priced 600 million won or less. As of June 2020, only 29 percent of all apartments in Seoul were in that price range. Meanwhile, the ratio of apartments priced above 900 million won has increased from 15 percent to 39 percent over the three-year period.           Due to this trend, it has become increasingly challenging to find reasonably-priced apartments in neighborhoods known for affordable options. Only 8 percent of apartments in Gangdong District in eastern Seoul are below the 600 million-won mark. The percentage below 600 million won in Seongbuk District, central Seoul, dropped from 97 percent to 33 percent. Staggering drops were also reported in Dongdaemun, Seodaemun, Eunpyeong and Gwanak districts.             The average price of apartments in Gangdong District in eastern Seoul was 14.46 million won per 3.3 square meters (35.5 square feet) in May 2017, but at the end of July, the value was 24 million won. This is a 66 percent increase over a three-year period. The increase was high for Dongdaemun, Seodaemun, Eunpyeong and Gwanak districts.             Apartments above 900 million won are subject to the comprehensive real estate tax. They have been emerging in areas where the supply of pricey apartments used to be low: Dongdaemun, Seongbuk, Eunpyeong and Geumcheon districts. Three years ago, there were no apartments priced above 900 million won in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul. Nowadays, more than 20 percent of all apartments are above 900 million won.             Gangseo, Seongbuk, Guro, Eunpyeong and Geumcheon districts rarely had apartments priced above 900 million won in 2017. Nowadays, 10 percent of apartments in those neighborhoods are above that level. Increases were also reported in Seongdong, Jung, Dongjak and Gwangjin.             In the Gangnam region, which refers to three districts south of the Han River — Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa — and is a target of the government's war on real estate, apartments above 1.5 billion won are on the rise.           In Songpa District, southern Seoul, only five percent of its apartments were above 1.5 billion won in 2017. Currently, 43 percent of apartments there are above that price point. Gangnam District’s share of those apartments went up from 26 percent to 73 percent. Seocho District’s share rose from 22 percent to 67 percent.           The average price of 3.3 square meters is 49.99 million won in Gangnam District, and 42.17 million won in Seocho District. In Gangnam District, the increase was 52 percent, and in Seocho District it was 56 percent.           In the real estate market, there is criticism that the 23 sets of real estate measures have negatively impacted the lives of the middle-class population.             “The government’s real estate measures began by targeting Gangnam’s housing prices, and a ‘balloon effect’ emerged from the efforts to rein in the apartment prices in Gangnam, resulting in price increase,” said Kang Chang-deok, a professor in the urban planning and real estate department at Chung-Ang University. “The government needs to make a move to stabilize the housing market for the middle-class population, and it needs to consider whether targeting prices in Gangnam is the right method for stabilization.”             “The premature real estate policies have made climbing the property ladder for those with no homes impossible, and given tax bombs to those who already own homes,” said Kim.             BY CHOI HYUN-JU   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]                     "
183,Duty-free bidding fails again for Terminal 1 retail spaces,"

     The duty-free section of Incheon International Airport is empty Wednesday. [NEWS1]               Incheon International Airport's Terminal 1 duty free could soon be more than half empty as bidding for six spaces fell through with cash-strapped duty-free retailers dropping out.             This is the first time bidding for all duty-free sections available failed.               Duty-free stores obtain business rights at the airport every five years through open bidding. The recent round was the second in a process that started in February for contracts allowing them to operate inside the airport until 2025.           Six sections with 6,131 square meters (65,993 square feet) of floor space hit the market in this round.             Shinsegae Duty Free participated in the bidding for the fashion and accessories section, which is DF6, and Lotte Duty Free participated in the bidding for DF3 and DF4, which are the liquor and tobacco sections. The cosmetics and fragrance section, which is DF2 and considered the most expensive of all sections in Terminal 1, was left empty with no bidders. No one bid on DF8 and DF9, which are designated for a wide range of merchandise.           Hyundai and Shilla Duty Free issued statements Tuesday that they dropped out due to coronavirus uncertainties.             According to the law, a bid only goes through if two or more operators compete for the same area. Bids were all canceled since all spaces had either a single bidder or no bidders, according to an announcement made by the airport Tuesday.             Despite the airport making unprecedented rental offers — promising 30 percent discounts, a flexible rent plan and lowering of the minimum bidding price — it was not enough to convince the retailers, as the once lucrative business struggles as a result of worldwide travel bans.             Sales of Korea’s four main duty-free retailers dropped 26.23 percent on year in the January-July period, posting a total of 8.6 trillion won ($7.4 billion).

     Employees disinfect a wedding hall in Suwon, Gyeonggi, on Aug. 19. Korea's number of marriages sharply declined in July due to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic. [NEWS1]          The number of newlyweds in Korea has been on the decline as the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic forces couples to postpone wedding plans and limits dating.           Statistics Korea reported Wednesday that some 126,367 couples tied the knot between January and July, a 9.3 percent drop compared to the same period a year earlier. It marks the lowest number of marriages for any January to July period since the statistics agency started compiling data in 1981.           In July alone, 17,080 couples married, a 10.9 percent decline compared to same month a year before.           “The number of marriages has been shrinking as the number of women in their 30s, the age bracket when most people get married, are declining,” a spokesperson for Statistics Korea said. “More couples postponing their weddings due to Covid-19 pandemic is also affecting the national marriage rate.”           The number of divorces, on the other hand, increased by 3.1 percent on year to reach 9,787 in July.           The data from Statistics Korea also showed that 165,730 babies were born between January to July, a 9.8 percent decline compared to the same period last year.             Some 23,067 babies were born in July, compared to 25,222 tallied in the same month in 2019. It marks the lowest number of newborns for any July since the the statistics agency started collecting monthly data in 1981.           The number of deaths between January and July reached 176,363, a 3.7 percent increase compared to the same period last year.

185,"[NEWS IN FOCUS] LG Chem, SK Innovation throw final punches in battery brawl","

     Headquarters of SK Innovation and LG Chem in Seoul. [YONHAP]         The year-long battery brawl between LG Chem and SK Innovation is coming to an end in two weeks, but the two battery makers still seem to be a long way from making amends.           If the two fail to reach an agreement before the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) announces its final ruling next month, SK Innovation may end up being forced to close a massive electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Georgia in the United States before it ever actually begins mass production.           After starting an investigation on LG Chem’s request in May 2019, the ITC made an initial determination in favor of LG Chem in mid-February. The two companies have been engaging in talks for a settlement since then, but local media outlets have reported little progress saying they were unable to get close to agreement on the sum of money LG wanted SK to pay to stop the ITC procedure.           Neither company has spoken publicly on the progress of the settlement discussion, but it’s not hard to guess their relationship hasn’t improved much.           After months of silence, the fighting started again in early September. LG Chem reported to the U.S. ITC in late August that SK Innovation had erased critical evidence and sued LG on infringing patents that were LG's to start with.           This complaint regards a separate ITC suit SK Innovation filed in September 2019, claiming LG violated its No. 994 battery patent which contains the structure of pouch-type lithium-ion battery cells.             In a Sept. 4 statement, LG Chem claimed that same technology was already being used in A7 batteries first sold to carmaker Chrysler in 2013 — years before SK registered the patent in 2015.           “Forensics revealed that SK Innovation erased documents related to LG’s battery technology and patent No. 994, restored them, left copies and shared them with SK’s lawyer but did not submit them to the ITC,” LG said.           SK Innovation denied both claims and filed a complaint to the U.S. ITC on Sept. 11. According to the company’s Tuesday statement, released after the ITC complaint was made public, the documents LG claimed were erased were properly saved in its database and offered to the ITC. Patent No. 994 also contained different technology from what was used in LG’s A7 battery, it said.           “Thinking from common sense, it’s absurd that we would erase relevant documents for a patent infringement suit we filed,” SK said in the statement, slamming LG’s move as a strategy to impose a framework that would work against SK in ongoing suits.           At the moment, the future looks grim for SK Innovation, Korea’s third largest EV battery supplier. The U.S. ITC in April did announce it would “review the initial determination in its entirety.” While the decision to fully review is not common, the ITC has not reversed its initial determination in similar cases since 2010.           SK has already lost one civil suit against LG. On Aug. 27, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed SK’s request to halt ongoing suits regarding its larger rival and receive 1 billion won ($861,000) in damages. This was the first domestic legal ruling in the battle between the two.           But the worst-case scenario for SK Innovation is the loss in the main suit regarding the misappropriation of trade secrets. Halting exports of batteries, parts and production facilities could put a stop to two large-scale EV battery plants in Georgia, both under construction.           If completed as planned, they were to have a combined annual capacity of 20 gigawatt hours by 2023, equivalent to supplying 400,000 EVs. At the moment, LG Chem is the only company that runs an EV battery plant in the United States, located in Michigan.           The problem is not solely SK Innovation’s — the company already has large contracts with Ford and Volkswagen, two of the largest U.S. carmakers that pledged to expand the number of EVs in their product portfolio.            SK’s struggles raise an issue for them as well because EV batteries are often developed in partnership with carmakers to optimize performance per model, not to mention that securing battery supply is already a struggle as demand climbs.           Both U.S. companies have offered a helping hand to SK, sending documents to the ITC this year warning of the supply crisis and the negative impact in employment the decision could incur. SK is hoping that the current administration will overrule the ITC’s determination out of concerns over employment in Georgia and neighboring regions, which are part of the industrial “Rust Belt.”           The U.S. ITC’s final determination is due on Oct. 5.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
186,Lawmaker forfeits PPP membership amid corruption allegations,"

                           Rep. Park Duk-hyum says in a press conference on Wednesday that he will forfeit his membership with the People Power Party (PPP) and face corruption allegations as an independent lawmaker.  [YONHAP]                A main opposition party lawmaker on Wednesday announced he will forfeit his party membership following criticism over the conflict of interest between his family’s construction business and his work on the National Assembly committee overseeing the Land Ministry.           Rep. Park Duk-hyum of the People Power Party (PPP) held a press conference Wednesday to announce his decision to leave the party.             “I decided to leave the party in order to lift the burden off the PPP and my fellow lawmakers,” he said.             Asked if he had consulted with the PPP leadership before announcing his departure, Park said, “Absolutely not.”             Park plans to fight back against political attacks from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) as an independent lawmaker and prove his innocence. He apologized to the public for troubling them with the scandal.             While Park will leave the party, he will maintain his Assembly seat and continue representing Boeun, Okcheon, Yeongdong and Goesan counties in North Chungcheong.             The three-term lawmaker faced accusations from DP lawmakers that construction companies owned by him and his family won massive national and local government projects as a result of his membership on the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee of the National Assembly. The committee has oversight of the Land Ministry and affiliated institutions.           Park won his first election in 2012 and started serving on the Land Committee in April 2015. After suspicions arose about possible conflicts of interest with his family businesses, Park stepped down from the committee earlier this month and began serving on the Environment and Labor Committee.           Park rejected the allegations of a conflict of interest, but the DP said Park’s family businesses scored over 100 billion won ($86 million) in revenue through construction and technology contracts secured from the Land Ministry and public institutions supervised by the ministry over the last five years. It said Park must give up his lawmaker seat and submit to a criminal investigation.             The PPP will have 103 lawmakers after Park’s leaving.             As a result of the April general elections, the PPP won 103 seats in the 300-memebr legislature. The party’s total number of lawmakers briefly went up to 104 after it reinstated the membership of an independent lawmaker, Rep. Kweon Seong-dong, last week.                   BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

188,Government property reconstruction project mentioned,"

                           A jeonse offering post being taken down at a real estate agency in Mapo District, western Seoul, on Tuesday. Jeonse offerings have been drying up fast, especially in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, since the National Assembly passed legislation that protects tenants, including automatic extension and a cap on rent increases. [YONHAP]               A property reconstruction project that will be supported by state-owned institutions will be named soon, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said.           “A pilot project will be determined in December,” Hong said during a government meeting on real estate measures on Wednesday. “We are currently in the preliminary stages.”             He said there has been strong interest from the private sector despite earlier concerns.             The government in August laid out a housing supply plan, which will include 50,000 units in redevelopment projects over the next five years in an effort to cool a housing market overheated by fear of housing shortages.             One of the plans includes raising the maximum floor area ratio for reconstruction projects from 250 percent to 500 percent. This new measure allows the maximum height of the apartment to be raised from 35 stories to 50 floors.             A condition for the government approving the eased floor area ratio is the mandatory participation of state-owned housing developers Korea Land & Housing and Seoul Housing & Communities.           While the participation of these public housing companies will speed up the process by cutting back on red tape, the reconstruction projects will have to lease or sell 50 to 70 percent of the newly built apartments to low-income households, newlyweds and young people.             When the announcement was made, there was skepticism in the real estate market as to whether there would be any interest in neighborhoods that have been vying for reconstruction due to the heavy-handed intervention by the government.             Complexes that have had strong market interest for reconstruction, such as Jamsil 5 Danji or Eunma in southern Seoul, will unlikely accept the proposal, it was thought. The low returns are expected from the reconstruction if at least half the units go to the government for low-income households, newlyweds and young people, which could drive down the value of the newly built apartment.             Less popular neighborhoods, including Heukseok-dong, Dongjak District in southern Seoul, Seongbuk District, central Seoul and Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi were among 20 neighborhoods where interest was expressed in the zone-level redevelopment.             During the meeting, Finance Minister Hong said the real estate market is finally showing signs of stability, and he expects that the jeonse long-term rent market will also stabilize soon. He credited the government’s measures.             According to the government, Seoul apartment prices have increased 0.01 percent for four consecutive weeks. In the case of the four districts in Gangnam — Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa and Gangdong — prices have remained flat for six consecutive weeks.             “What we should take notice of is that the purchasing sentiment that precedes the housing market price increases has started to ease,” Hong said. “There have been growing expectations on supply measures that were announced including the website for the third New Towns projects drawing more than 1 million views and the process of selecting candidates for redevelopment projects starting.”           He stressed that the purchasing frenzy in Seoul is on the decline.             Hong added that the three tenant protection legislation reforms, including automatic lease extensions and the limiting of rent increases, that passed the National Assembly in July will also contribute to stabilizing the rent crisis.             While jeonse prices have been easing, concerns of landlords no longer offering jeonse apartments are on the rise. Since the tenant protection legislations were passed, Seoul jeonse offers have declined 80 percent.             Reports of conflicts between landlords and tenants over extension rights have been on the rise.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]               "

190,"Divers, scientists see climate change altering Jeju's aquatic ecosystem","

     Coral colonies are increasingly found in the waters off the coast of Jeju Island near Munseom, a popular diving spot. Jeju waters have seen a rise in temperatures, with native fish and algae being replaced by subtropical species. [LEE SEON-MYEONG]         Global warming appears to be taking a toll on the ecosystems of Korea's seas, with tropical fish and colorful corals appearing in Jeju waters and replacing the native conch, abalone and brown algae.             Longtime divers say that starting about 15 years ago, coral reefs and sea anemone — typically seen in subtropical waters — started appearing in the waters off the coast of Korea’s southern Jeju Island.             “Just 30 years ago, the minimum water temperature dropped to 13 degrees Celsius [55 degrees Fahrenheit],” said Kim Byung-il, a Jeju diver of 34 years. “But so far this year, it only dropped to 15 degrees. A two-degree rise is a big difference [in terms of water temperature.] On land, that would amount to a difference of around 20 degrees.”             The JoongAng Ilbo visited Munseom, an island off the coast of Seogwipo Port that has become a popular scuba diving spot, on Aug. 13 as part of the newspaper’s 55th anniversary series on climate change.             The reporting team saw with their own eyes the changes in the ecosystem of the Jeju waters.             Once divers pass through the kelp forest, vital food for fish, they are greeted by brilliant soft coral and towering sea anemones.             “You couldn’t see spinose giant sea anemones just 30 years ago, but they began spreading rapidly starting from 15 years ago,” said Kim. “They grow up to 50 centimeters [20 inches] annually, and there are now tens of thousands of polyps in this area.”              Sea anemone higher than human height tower in the Jeju waters. [LEE SEON-MYEONG]         The rapid change in Jeju's underwater ecosystem comes as water temperatures in the seas off Korea’s southern coast rose 1.5 degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, according to experts, which is three times the global average.             “Fish that can only be spotted in tropical seas have begun appearing and the native fish are disappearing,"" said Lee Seon-myeong, an underwater photographer with 50 years of diving experience.          In another diving spot a 10-minute boat ride from Munseom, the seascape has drastically changed.           “With the rise in water temperatures, the diversity of species has dropped markedly,” Kim said. “In the past, there was a lot of gulfweed and brown algae, which served as hideouts and spawning grounds for many fish. But brown algae has disappeared and been replaced by hard corals.”             According to a long-term study of the marine ecosystem in Munseom waters conducted by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, the concentration of Ecklonia cava, a species of brown algae, measured at depths between 10 and 15 meters (33 to 49 feet), dropped from 67.5 percent in 2002 to 4.2 percent in 2015.             Meanwhile, the concentration of soft coral increased from 2.5 percent to 12.7 percent during the same period, according to the study, led by Park Sang-yul of Jeju National University and Lee Hyuk-je of Sangji University.             “In the past, typhoons only affected water levels above five meters, but recently, the strength has increased and they affect water levels up to 15 meters. Consequently, soft coral are growing in spots where the brown algae have drifted away, and spots for algae habitation is decreasing,” Park said.                Native brown algae are disappearing in Jeju waters, replaced by hard corals. [LEE SEON-MYEONG]         With the disappearance of marine forests, conch, abalone and other native shellfish that feed of algae are also diminishing.             In turn, haenyeo, the indigenous female divers of Jeju who are on Unesco’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage, wonder how many of them will be able to continue their livelihoods in the next decade.             A group of haenyeo were catching sea snails off the coast of Gapa Island, some 10 minutes by boat from Unjin Port in Seogwipo. After one hour, they could barely fill half their basket.             “A change as sharp as falling off a precipice has happened in Jeju waters in the past decade,” said Kim Yeong-nam, a 30-year veteran haenyeo. “I think the number of Jeju haenyeo will shrink to half within 15 years.”             Park added that the impacts changing seas will likely be felt more broadly.           “There have to be preparations made for climate change to prevent a collapse in the fishing village economy,” he said.             BY CHUN KWON-PIL, SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

     Face masks being loaded onto the Korean Air Force's KC-330 aerial refueling aircraft before it was due to depart to Iraq to evacuate Korean citizens this July. The masks were donated to the Iraqi government. [AIR FORCE]               Newly appointed Minister of National Defense Suh Wook will visit the United States on an Air Force tanker plane next month to discuss the transfer of wartime operational control (Opcon), according to military sources.           Suh, who was appointed last week, will take part in the allies’ annual Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) in Washington after traveling on a KC-330 aerial refueling aircraft, several sources said.           “This is the first time a defense minister has taken a refueling plane, rather than a commercial aircraft, to make an overseas trip,” said one source, who requested anonymity.           “The decision is said to be related to reductions in commercial flights due to recent coronavirus outbreaks.”           The KC-330 Cygnus is formally known as a Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), capable of carrying out diverse operations in addition to refueling aircraft mid-air.           Save for its aerial refueling equipment, the aircraft is almost identical to an ordinary commercial plane, as it is based on the design of the 300-seat Airbus A330-200.           “At the time we commissioned this plane, we chose it over its competitor, the Boeing KC-46A, because we concluded it could perform a greater variety of operations, like the transportation of military personnel,"" a source said.           According to the Air Force, the KC-330 has six business class seats, reserved for high-ranking officers and crew, and 296 regular seats.           The plane’s utility has become particularly clear amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to one military source, the demand for the plane has increased significantly within the military due to an ongoing crunch in international flights.           “[Unlike the KC-330,] the C-130 transport planes originally used by the military are slow and not conducive for long-range travel, as the planes could only make it as far as Southeast Asia before they need refueling,” the source said. “The plane could only fit around 90 people and the seats were uncomfortable.”           The KC-330 proved its worth in the government’s evacuation operations of Korean citizens this year. In July, 293 Korean workers in Iraq were evacuated on two KC-330 planes, which also carried face masks to donate to the Iraqi government.             In June on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War, the plane was also used to retrieve the remains of 147 South Korean soldiers from Hawaii. North Korea earlier that year had repatriated boxes of remains of UN troops, including South Koreans, who died in the war to the United States as a sign of goodwill amid their denuclearization negotiations.           The use of such a plane to transport Suh to Washington testifies to the importance of his trip, which is likely to be the last opportunity this year for the allies to consult the timetable for the Opcon transfer to South Korea.             According to a Korean government source, concern is mounting over whether the envisioned transfer can take place, as scheduled, by the end of President Moon Jae-in’s term in 2022, given the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed necessary assessment procedures about the combat abilities of Seoul’s military.             “If Minister Suh is unable to resolve this issue at the SCM, effectively the last venue for negotiations with the United States this year, then the Opcon transfer may be a foregone conclusion within this administration,” said the government source.             BY KIM SANG-JIN   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]         "

[YONHAP]         Korea's daily new coronavirus infections snapped back into the triple digits for the first time in four days, adding 110 new cases Wednesday, one week before the Chuseok holiday kicks off.             After stringent social distancing measures started in August, the country saw cases fall back to the double digits Sunday, recording 82 Covid-19 patients, and 61 new cases on Tuesday, the lowest figure since Aug. 13.           Of the new cases Wednesday, 99 were local infections and 11 were imported, including three patients from Uzbekistan.             This brings total cases to 23,216 as of Tuesday midnight, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said Wednesday, while the death toll remained at 388 with a fatality rate of 1.67 percent.           Local transmissions were concentrated in the metropolitan areas, with 40 in Seoul, 28 in Gyeonggi and five in Incheon. Others included six in Busan, three in Daegu, two in Gwangju, four in South Chungcheong and six in North Gyeongsang.             Infections continued to take place in offices and medical facilities and through door-to-door salespersons.           One cluster was at a securities company in Yeouido in Yeongdeungpo District, western Seoul, which added five cases as of Wednesday after the first patient was found on Saturday. They all worked on the same floor.           Another cluster of infections was at a company in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, that distributes masks. It added 11 new patients Wednesday, bringing total cases to 38.           In a briefing Wednesday, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters urged people to refrain from returning to their hometowns over the five-day Chuseok holiday from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4 and from unnecessary travel in general. Jeju Island and Gangwon are popular domestic tourist destinations now that overseas travel is difficult because of the pandemic.           The government said it will continue to implement its ban on people visiting elderly care facilities, in place after Level 2 social distancing measures were instituted last month, over Chuseok. It instead encouraged video calls and writing letters to loved ones.             Up to 300,000 tourists are expected to visit Jeju Island during the Chuseok holiday period. Next month, there is another three-day weekend as Hangul Day on Oct. 9 falls on a Friday.           The Jeju provincial government is designating Sept. 26 to Oct. 11 as a special period for monitoring quarantine measures and asked that visitors with fevers refrain from visiting the island during the Chuseok holiday.           The Jeju government said it will require coronavirus testing for any visitor with a temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit) starting this weekend. It also is requiring tourists to wear masks during their visits to the island and asked them to visit a local health care center if they develop any suspicious symptoms while traveling. Those with coronavirus symptoms will be required to self-isolate at a private residence or designated accommodation until they get a negative Covid-19 test result back.           Those who violate quarantine measures could be fined up to 3 million won under the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act.           Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said in a briefing, “The government is urging people to refrain from visiting their homes and relatives, as well as from traveling, but during the holiday period, the accommodation reservation rate is very high, thus there is a need for hotels, leisure facilities and tourist spots to thoroughly prepare quarantine measures.”           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

[YONHAP]               The South Korean military revealed Wednesday that a government fisheries official was possibly picked up by North Koreans after he apparently jumped overboard while working on a boat off the coast of Yeonpyeong Island on Monday.           Seoul’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement it was leaving all possibilities open — including the likelihood that he defected — after revealing that the fisheries control official was spotted alive in North Korean waters Tuesday afternoon.           The 47-year-old works as a monitoring official for the West Sea Fisheries Management Service, an agency under the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries responsible for protecting fisheries in the Yellow Sea, based in Mokpo, South Jeolla.             On Monday, he was aboard a monitoring boat with several colleagues around two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the coast of Small Yeonpyeong Island when they became aware of his absence at 11:30 a.m., according to the Coast Guard.             His colleagues later reported him missing after discovering only his shoes on board the boat, prompting the Coast Guard to scramble a major search operation at around 1:50 p.m. that afternoon.           Around 20 vessels, including a Navy boat and plane, were deployed to search for the missing official in nearby waters.           The Defense Ministry said it believed the official was still alive after he was last spotted on the North Korean side above the so-called Northern Limit Line, approximately 10 kilometers north of where he went missing. The military's statement did not provide any further details of the sighting.           “We will take necessary measures, including investigating the route [taken by the official] and verifying relevant details with the North,” the ministry said in a statement.            Though a probe is ongoing, military officials believe the man could have been swept northwards by tide, or possibly made his way into North Korean waters deliberately — though how he was able to swim the distance and evade several South Korean maritime patrols in the area remains a mystery.           The South Korean military could inquire about the missing official with the North’s authorities through a military communications line, the United Nations Command or the Red Cross Society at Panmunjom.             But it is unclear what active links are still in place, or whether Pyongyang will respond, given the regime's announcement last June that it was severing all official communications with Seoul in protest of South Korean activists’ dispatches of propaganda leaflets across the border.             The area in which the fisheries official disappeared has been the site of several major military confrontations between the two Koreas since the 1950-53 Korean War.             There were two naval engagements between the two countries’ navies in 1999 and 2002, both yielding dozens of casualties, while Large Yeonpyeong Island was notably shelled by North Korean coastal artillery in a major provocation in 2010 that killed four South Korean soldiers and civilians.           Nonetheless, many have braved these dangerous waters as a route to defect to the other side — mostly North Korean sailors fleeing to the South, but occasionally disaffected residents in South Korea to the North.             Most recently in July, a former defector to the South returned back to the North across a narrow strait between South Korea’s Ganghwa Island and the North’s South Hwanghae Province, prompting North Korea to shut down its border town of Kaesong for fears of Covid-19 contagion.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
194,SKT targets corporate clients with expanded 5G network,"

     A smartphone shows a webinar hosted by SK Telecom on Wednesday. [SK TELECOM]               SK Telecom will target corporate clients when it expands its 5G network later this year, aiming to deliver faster speeds than the current commercial service through a greater range of frequencies.           The company said during an online seminar Wednesday that it will introduce a 28 gigahertz band available on standalone mode within this year.           Korean carriers currently use a 3.5 gigahertz spectrum on the non-standalone version, which introduces delays by requiring support from the existing 4G LTE.           “Considering the 28 gigahertz’s signal characteristics and technique, [the band] is ideal for business-to-business services,” said Ryu Jung-hwan, vice president at SK Telecom’s 5GX Infra Group, at the event.           “Now that the 5G standard Release 16 was set in July, an industry-leading B2B business model is the key to success,” he said.           The webinar centered around discussing the carrier's strategy to further commercialize 5G and the technological state of the latest wireless internet connectivity, bringing together Ross O’Brien, a senior contributing editor to MIT Technology Review, and Alex Choi from Deutsche Telekom as well as SKT officials.           The current 5G network has often come under fire due to its low speeds and high frequency of delay. Industry insiders have maintained that further migration into the new mode and spectrum could ease the issue.             Still, participants in the webinar weren't entirely positive.           Ryu went on to note that devices fitted with chip for the 28 gigahertz network will be more expensive than the current 5G-enabled smartphones.           The equipment needed for the spectrum also remains bulky, a factor that could turn away corporate clients, according to Ryu.           SK Telecom is on track to reduce the size of the network equipment, he said.           The number of 5G users in Korea reached nearly 8 million in July, according to the latest data available by the Ministry of Science and ICT. The ministry and SK Telecom both predicted that the number could surpass 10 million by the end of this year.           SK Telecom has the most 5G subscribers among the Korean mobile carriers, at 4 million.            Korea was the first country in the world to commercialize a 5G network. But, the quality and availability of the network fell short of expectations.           For instance, Korea’s 5G users are found to be connected to the network at just over 20 percent of the time, according to a report released by industry tracker Opensignal in August.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
195,Samsung demonstrates 5G network slicing with KDDI,"

                  Samsung Electronics said Tuesday it has successfully verified an advanced 5G technology with Japanese telecom operator KDDI as the Korean company tries to expand its presence in next-generation wireless solutions.           Samsung and KDDI demonstrated 5G network slicing technology in Tokyo with the Radio Access Network (RAN) Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform that efficiently controls network resources.           Network slicing is considered a key technology for the 5G network, as it enables a physical network to be partitioned into multiple virtual networks to offer high-speed, low-latency communication.           Samsung said the network slicing technology allows telecom operators to provide better services in sectors such as autonomous driving, cloud gaming and industrial Internet of Things solutions.           With their verification test results, Samsung and KDDI said they plan to suggest international standardization bodies set standards on 5G network slicing.           Last year, Samsung was selected by KDDI to provide 5G network solutions for the Japanese firm's 5G service.           Yonhap                     "
196,Moon's UN speech falls flat,"






     President Moon Jae-in gives a video speech for the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, Korean time. [YONHAP]               President Moon Jae-in’s speech calling for the international community to support a formal end to the Korean War is getting poor reviews and being ignored by the countries most involved: the United States, China and North Korea.            “In his keynote speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Moon said an end-of-war declaration will open the door to complete denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula,” said Rep. Yun Hee-suk, spokesman for the People Power Party (PPP), on Wednesday. “One year and two months ago, the president made a similar remark. We wonder how useful this proposal is in our current situation.”             Moon delivered a speech by video to the 75th UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday. The UN held the event via video link due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Moon's speech was aired early Wednesday morning in Seoul. Among more than 170 leaders who participated in the meeting, Moon was the 10th to speak.           ""I hope that the UN and the international community provide support so that we can advance into an era of reconciliation and prosperity through the end-of-war declaration,"" Moon said. ""The end-of-war declaration will, indeed, open the door to complete denuclearization and permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.""           The two Koreas remain in a technical state of war. In 1953, an armistice agreement was signed by the UN Command, North Korea and China.             ""Peace on the Korean Peninsula will guarantee peace in Northeast Asia as a whole and, going one step further, bring positive changes to the world order as well,"" Moon said in his speech. ""I believe it begins with declaring an end to the war, an act that can affirm mutual commitments to peace.""           Moon’s claim that an end to the conflict would ""open the door to complete denuclearization” is a change from his previous position that progress needed to be made toward denuclearization of North Korea as a precondition for an end-of-war declaration.           In a 2018 UN General Assembly speech, Moon said, ""I look forward to seeing bold measures for denuclearization implemented among the related countries, leading to the declaration to end the war.""             During the first years of Moon's presidency, expectations were high that inter-Korean relations and North-U.S. relations would see real progress toward denuclearization. In 2018, inter-Korean relations progressed rapidly, and Moon held three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in that year. Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington were also active.           But expectations faded after a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in February 2019 collapsed. Inter-Korean relations also became frozen.           Moon’s latest proposal gained no immediate response from the countries that would be involved in replacing the Korean War armistice with a declaration of a formal ending of the war.           U.S. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping also delivered speeches for the UN General Assembly, and North Korea issues were conspicuously missing in them.           North Korea made no response to Moon’s speech as of Wednesday afternoon.           The Blue House defended Moon’s speech Wednesday, although it admitted that a formal ending of the Korean War won’t be realized quickly.           “A speech of a political leader is an expression of his will and commitment,” a senior presidential aide said.           He said it has been a consistent position of the Moon administration to replace the armistice. That was also agreed between Moon and Kim during their first summit in 2018 and between Trump and Kim in their first summit in Singapore, he said, although no actual progress has been made.           “In order to create a breakthrough, the president did what he can do to restart the stalled clock of denuclearization and peace regime,” the aide said.             According to Blue House sources, Moon and his security aides spent weeks debating whether the proposal should be part of the UN speech or not. While some protested, citing North Korea’s recent snubs, Moon decided to include it, they said.           In his speech, Moon also proposed establishing a regional public health organization and using it as a means to guarantee security to the North.             ""Hoping that the international community views the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula through the lens of more inclusive international cooperation, I propose today launching a Northeast Asia Cooperation Initiative for Infectious Disease Control and Public Health, whereby North Korea participates as a member along with China, Japan, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea,"" he said, using South Korea's formal name.           ""A cooperative architecture that guarantees collective protection of life and safety will lay the groundwork for North Korea to have its security guaranteed by engaging with the international community.""           The countries mentioned in Moon’s speech apparently gave no immediate responses.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
197,Bank of Korea expands support for small businesses,"

                  The central bank said Wednesday it will further expand financial support for smaller merchants and firms to help them ease a funding squeeze amid the new coronavirus outbreak.           The Bank of Korea (BOK) said it has decided to raise the cap on its low-rate loans to banks by 8 trillion won ($6.88 billion) to 43 trillion won. The decision will be approved by the monetary board Thursday.           Under the scheme, the bank provides funds to local banks at an interest rate of 0.25 percent to encourage them to extend lending to smaller merchants and companies.           Of the newly added funds, 3 trillion won each will be set aside for small merchants and companies that have suffered financial damage from the virus outbreak.           The remaining 2 trillion won will be reserved for lending to startups and parts and equipment producers to support their facility investment, the bank said.           Bank loans to smaller firms and self-employed people grew 6.1 trillion won in August, as they took out fresh loans to cushion the virus fallout, according to separate data from the central bank.                 Yonhap           "

[YG ENTERTAINMENT]               YG Entertainment announced Wednesday that the construction of its new headquarters, which took four years, has finally reached a conclusion.             The new nine-story building in Hapjeong-dong in Mapo District, western Seoul, is located right next to the former headquarters of the agency and is about 10 times larger than the old building.             The old and new building will be connected with a sky bridge, said the company.           The new building is equipped with spacious dance studios, high-tech recording studios as well as a gym and a whole floor dedicated to a cafeteria.          Due to security reasons, the company couldn’t secure a separate zone for the fans inside the new building but rented a newly established building right across from the headquarters to turn it into a cafe and an exhibition area so that the fans can freely relax and spend time.           “There have been so many fans who pace up and down in front of the YG building, especially those who came all the way to Korea from different parts of the world, just to catch a glimpse of the YG artists,” said an official from the company.            “The problem was that they were still there even under the scorching sun or in bitter cold. It really worried us. And having no restrooms nearby as well.”           The building dedicated for the fans, according to YG Entertainment, will be ready by the end of this year.           BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]         "
199,Gov't vows to spend extra budget with dispatch,"

     Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, left, and Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki walk into a cabinet meeting at the government complex in central Seoul on Wednesday. The National Assembly approved a 7.8 trillion won ($6.9 billion) fourth supplementary budget late Tuesday. [YONHAP]               The government vowed to quickly spend the fourth supplementary budget of 7.8 trillion won ($6.9 billion) that was approved by the National Assembly late Tuesday.             “Speed is the essence of a supplementary budget,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Wednesday during a cabinet meeting held to approve last-minute changes to the budget made by the legislature.              He likened the spending of the budget to the first four minutes that determine the fate of a patient who has a heart attack.             “The supplementary budget should be like the cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a patient in an emergency situation,” Chung said.           He asked government departments to make sure spending reaches people in need.             “While the supplementary budget has been created with difficulty [and financed] through debt, it is a fact that it is not enough to fully recover from the damages [inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic],” Chung said. “Yet, we will do our best so that the people will be able to enjoy a warm Chuseok and be able to use [the supplementary budget support] to rebound [from hardship].”           The government has stressed that the budget is focused on self-employed business badly affected by the resurgence of the coronavirus since mid-August.             Starting Thursday, the government will be accepting applications from self-employed businesses as well as freelancers, private tutors and door-to-door salesperson for subsidies.           This also includes room salons (hostess bars) and cola-tech joints (no-alcohol dance clubs for teenagers). Even taxi drivers will be eligible to apply for the subsidy.             Previously, private taxi drivers were eligible. Now, even those who work for taxi companies will be able to apply. If approved, each will receive 1 million won.             However, approval will depend on the length of their time on the job as well as the amount of losses they have suffered due to the pandemic.             For small businesses with annual revenues below 400 million won, the subsidy is up to 2 million won. Applications can be made online.             Some 3.4 trillion won — 44 percent of the total supplementary budget — will be used to support small businesses. That was increased from an initial proposal of 3.3 trillion won.             The government estimated that it can offer support to 2.94 self-employed people, which is roughly 87 percent of such businesses.           In the budget, 100 billon won will be used to pay 500,000 won each to 200,000 self-employed business owners forced to close. The government hopes the 500,000 won will be used to start a new business or land a job.           The government started accepting applications from freelancers and door-to-door salesmen for the up to 1.5 million won emergency employment stabilization subsidy starting Wednesday. The first payment is likely to be made today.             Some 500,000 people already received 1.5 million won subsidies from the third supplementary budget in July. They are eligible for 500,000 won more from the fourth extra budget. New applicants, which the government estimates at 200,000, will receive 1.5 million won.           The government hopes to complete distribution of the subsidies to the first group by Sept. 29.           The second will likely receive their subsidies in November.           Additionally, the government will be handing out expanded child care support.           Previously it was planning to give 200,000 won to families for each child in elementary or younger. That was expanded to include middle school kids, who will receive 150,000 won each.           The child care budget was raised from 1.1 trillion won to 1.3 trillion won.             As agreed between the ruling Democratic Party and the opposition People Power Party on Tuesday, a phone bill subsidy has been cut from 930 billion won to 400 billion won and will only be given to people between the ages of 16 and 34 and 65 or older.           The government estimated that 20.4 million people will benefit from the 20,000 won subsidy.             On late Tuesday, the National Assembly approved the nation’s fourth supplementary budget for this year.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
200,Ryu and Kim hope to end on a high in final starts of the season,"

     Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays, left, and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St.Louis Cardinals will make their starts on the same day for the fourth time this season on Thursday. [AP/YONHAP, REUTERS/YONHAP]         For the fourth and the final time this season, the two Korean major leaguers will be starting on the same day on Thursday. With the clock winding down on the shortened 2020 season, they'll both be looking to finish strong.          Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays and Kim Kwang-hyun of the St. Louis Cardinals have regularly made headlines this season as they seem to have almost identical schedules. Expectations have been high every time they've played that they might finally pick up wins on the same day, but so far that hasn't happened.          This will be the fourth time this season that the two have started on the same day and once again, fans will be hoping to see both pitchers pick up wins for the first time in history.           Ryu will start his game first against the New York Yankees at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York. The game will start at 6:37 p.m. on Thursday, or 7:37 a.m. on Friday in Korea.           This will be Ryu’s second time pitching against the Yankees this season and his old struggles against the New York side have continued so far. Last time Ryu pitched against the Yankees, he walked away with a no-decision, but it was one of his worst games with the Blue Jays. Throughout five innings, Ryu gave up five runs, including three homers.           Thanks to the Blue Jays’ incredible scoring streak — 10 runs at the bottom of the sixth inning — Ryu avoided a loss.           Throughout his career in the major league, the Yankees seemed to be one of Ryu’s biggest weaknesses. Back when he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, he started against the Yankees twice, picking up losses in both games.             Ryu faced the Yankees for the first time back in June 2013. During that game, Ryu picked up a loss by giving up three runs and five hits, which included a home run, throughout six innings.           Last season he faced the Yankees for a second time, once again picking up a loss and giving up seven runs and nine hits including three homers, throughout four and one-third of an inning.           This season with the Blue Jays, Ryu has picked up four wins and two losses with a 3.00 ERA. Although he hasn't picked up as many wins as he used to back when he played for the Dodgers, he has been highly complimented by the manager and his teammates.             Although the Blue Jays are ranked third in the American League East division, the young team still has a slim shot at playing in the postseason as the Blue Jays can play in the wildcard if they manage to finish their season strong and keep their winning percentage high enough.           While Ryu hopes to end his nightmare against the Yankees and cement his role as the Blue Jays’ ace pitcher, Kim is looking to end his rookie season on a high note.           Just a little less than two hours into Ryu’s game, Kim will also be making his last start of the season against the Milwaukee Brewers at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, starting at 7:15 p.m., or 9:15 a.m. on Friday in Korea.           Kim joined the Cardinals this season with the hope of making the club’s starting rotation. As the Cardinals lacked left-handed pitchers, there were signs that Kim could end up debuting as a starter, but it wasn't to be and he started his MLB career in the bullpen.           Kim picked up one save for the Cardinals and was given an unexpected shot as a starter when a number of Cardinals players tested positive for the coronavirus.           Kim didn’t disappoint. Pitching in three and two-thirds of an inning for the Cardinals against the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 17, Kim gave up one run and walked away with a no-decision.           Then in his next start against the Cincinnati Reds on Aug. 22, Kim continued to impress by tossing six scoreless innings to pick up his first-ever win in a major league game.           Kim briefly dropped out of the rotation with a kidney ailment but that didn’t affect his performance for the season as he’s continued his strong pitching. He was added onto the Cardinals’ injured list but quickly came back to the rotation. Kim has picked up two wins, no losses and is heading into the last match of his rookie season with an astounding ERA of 1.59.           Just like the Blue Jays, the Cardinals also have a shot at the postseason.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]         "

How many shares it will offer has also not been decided yet, according to the bank.             “Kakao Bank’s IPO is to secure capital for continuous growth,” the company said in a release.           It said it would decide on the auditor and lead underwriters within this year.           Once the underwriters are decided, it takes an average of six months before going public on the market unless faced with unexpected hurdles such as being evaluated as underqualified by the Korea Exchange.           Kakao Games, for example, selected its underwriters in April and went public on the secondary Kosdaq in September.           The bank was founded in 2017 as a second mover in the industry after K bank.           Its capital totals 1.8 trillion won ($1.5 billion) as of Sept. 23. Its biggest shareholder is tech giant Kakao, holding 33.5 percent, followed by Korea Investment Value Asset Management with 28.6 percent. KB Kookmin Bank has a 9.86 percent share and Korean game company Netmarble has a 3.93 percent stake.           Kakao Bank turned to profit in 2019, two years after its foundation, by posting 13.7 billion won in net profit, a 166 percent jump compared to the previous year. In the first half of this year, it recorded 45.3 billion won in net profit, a 371.9 percent year-on-year jump.           Its number of active users stands at 12.9 million.           Amid the heated subscription competition in Korea’s IPO market, interest in Kakao Bank’s public registration among retail investors is already high.            Kakao Bank’s shares are being traded at 108,000 won per share over the counter on Sept. 23, amounting to 39.4 trillion won in market capitalization.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "
202,Boy band Treasure puts the 'T' in teamwork ,"

     Boy band Treasure [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               It’s only been a month since YG Entertainment’s newest boy band Treasure made its powerful debut with “Boy,” but it’s back again — this time, sporting a level of teamwork that has heightened even more since its debut.           Treasure’s new single “The First Step: Chapter Two” dropped on Sept. 18, a month after its debut single “The First Step: Chapter One” was released on Aug. 7. The band’s first lead track “Boy” was a hip-hop base dance track that was enough to make an impact on the listeners with its dynamic melody and catchy lyrics. The band’s newest lead track, “I Love You,” takes that one step further.           “We wanted to grab the hearts of the listeners with a faster and more powerful sound than the debut track ‘Boy,’” said Doyoung in an email interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. “It’s also our confession of our love to our fans.”           For “I Love You,” the 12 members of Treasure donned school uniform-style costumes to achieve a contrasting image of a young boy in love, who confesses his feelings with a powerful performance and cool look. “I Love You” carries a story that’s linked to “Boy,” where the members sing about their love in a straightforward manner. The group will be sporting various uniform costumes for the staged performances to come, all different in colors and style.           “It might be because we have a lot of members who are actually used to wearing school uniforms [because of our age], but we really liked this school-look style,” said Asahi.              Boy band Treasure [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               Another change visible within “I Love You” is that the teamwork between the members has grown over the past month. This is evident from the choreography routine the band pulled off that requires even more skills and synchrony than “Boy.” Having 12 members may seem like a lot of work, but it’s that very diversity that makes Treasure all the more special, according to the band, which gave the answer as a whole group.           “We think that because there are 12 members, we can show people 12 different charms — and this is what makes us special. Our teamwork is great, because we’ve spent so much time together. And we think that people still like us from the content we’ve presented through our YouTube channel even before our debut, like the ‘Treasure Map’ reality series and the cover videos [of other acts’ music]. On the stage, we show our powerful side. In our reality content, we show our friendly side. I think people like us for this and believe in our potential,” the band said.           So Jung-hwan added, “The performance has become a lot more powerful than ‘Boy,’ and the movement of the 12 members has evolved to become more organically connected. And I also hope people will pay attention to the tough dance moves as well as the addictive lyrics. There’s a part in the refrain where we repeat the words ‘I love you’ and that’s the best part.”              Captured images from the music video of boy band Treasure's new song ""I Love You."" [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               Having to prepare for a song right after their debut may have been a challenge for the group, but it was worth all the hard work to be able to give more music to the fans, according to the group. Members Choi Hyun-suk, Yoshi and Haruto once again took part in writing the lyrics of the song, as well as “Bling Like This,” an additional track included with the single. To see their ideas turn into real music gives them a fulfilling sensation that makes them more proud to take part, said Choi.           “Every musical instrument does its job,” said Choi. “And I think Treasure is like an instrument in a way. Each instrument that cannot be replaced by any other comes together to make the best music. The three of us had so much fun, just as we did for the last release. We depended on each other and had fun together.”           Nearing the Korean Chuseok harvest holidays, members say they will be spending time together as usual — especially since the group includes four members who are Japanese and cannot visit home due to the coronavirus.           “Talking to the members helps me to relieve so much stress. I remember how Haruto would come and comfort me when I was distressed in the past. I felt very grateful,” said Park Jeong-woo.           So added, “There was a scene in the music video for ‘I Love You’ that we shot at the seaside. I want to travel to the sea with the members one day. The wind was so cool when we were shooting, and we got to make precious memories together.”           Treasure aims to grow to become a leading K-pop act just like the other big-name stars also signed to YG Entertainment such as Blackpink and Big Bang. Blackpink recently collaborated with pop star Selena Gomez for a single titled “Ice Cream” released last month, and Treasure hopes to follow in the girl group's footsteps.            Members Choi and Jihoon picked YG’s artists G-Dragon, Mino, Bobby and Taeyang to collaborate with, while Bang Ye-dam extended his wish to outside of Korea.           “I would like to collaborate with [Indonesian singer] Niki,” said Bang. Jihoon also added, “I would like to work with The Weeknd in the future.”           As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, the members of Treasure wished people health and safety, and to cheer up listening to their music.              Boy band Treasure [YG ENTERTAINMENT]               “We are all going through hard times due to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic, but you all know that staying safe and healthy is the most important thing, right?” said Jihoon. “I hope you can all stay healthy until the day we can meet again. Some people message us saying that we help them stay happy, and that makes us even happier and allows us to try harder. I hope the day comes soon where we can enjoy the stage together with everyone.”           Choi added, “Music is a powerful medium that can deliver both joy and consolation. We would like to sometimes give joy to people, and sometimes consolation, through our music.”           Treasure aims to finish “The First Step” series by the end of this year, with two more albums. The group will pursue a variety of promotional schedules, such as music programs and TV entertainment shows. Rather than going solo or forming subunits, the group will focus on the whole of Treasure for the time being, but options remain open for the future, the band said.            BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "

204,Are Park Byung-ho's injuries a sign he's starting to slide?,"

     Park Byung-ho of the Kiwoom Heores [YONHAP]               The 2020 season is an important one for a number of veteran players in the KBO, with an unusual number nearing free agency in the next couple of years.            Although Kiwoom Heroes’ slugger Park Byung-ho won’t earn his free agent status this year, he will become a free agent in 2021. Since he has less than two years remaining, injury can be crucial.           Having returned to the KBO after his two-year stint in the major league — playing for the Minnesota Twins in 2016 and 2017 — injuries have been a major problem in his career.           This year was no exception.           During the Heroes’ game against the NC Dinos on Aug. 19 in Changwon, South Gyeongsang, Park was hit by a pitch on his left hand. After getting his hand checked, it was originally reported that he is expected to miss about three weeks. However, due to his slower-than-expected recovery, Park’s still out of the Heroes roster.           “As his bones haven’t healed completely, it’s expected to take about another month for him to fully recover,” said Heroes manager Son Hyuk on Sept. 16.           But this doesn’t mean that Park will be back in the Heroes’ lineup within a month. Since he needs to wait for his hand to heal before starting his rehabilitation and training, it is highly unlikely that Park will appear in the batter’s box in the regular season this year.           Until his injury, Park had played in 83 games for the Heroes this season with a batting average of 0.229, 20 home runs and 58 RBIs. Since 2012, this is the first time that he has failed to play in less than 100 games in a single season.           Looking at his performance this season, Park was fairly inconsistent. His batting average of 0.229 is the lowest since he joined the Heroes in 2011.           Although Park is unlikely to play 100 games, he still managed to make headlines this season when he hit his 20th home run of the season back on Aug. 11 during a game against the Hanwha Eagles. By hitting his 20th home run of the season, Park became only the second player in KBO history to knock 20 home runs out of the park in seven straight seasons.             His record ties that of former Samsung Lions slugger Lee Seung-yuop. As Lee retired in 2017, Park has a shot at setting a new record if he manages to hit 20 home runs or more next season.           When Park returned to the KBO in 2018 after two seasons in the major league, his impact was immediate, finishing the season with a 0.345 batting average with 43 home runs and 112 RBIs.           Forty-three home runs was good enough for him to win the KBO’s home run title for a fourth straight season, since 2012.           Even last year, when the KBO changed its official baseball and a lot of the top sluggers suddenly lost their power, it didn’t seem to affect Park significantly, as he still managed to hit 33 home runs to once again take home the home run title.             But while Park is still a threat in the batter’s box, his slugging percentage this season suggests the glory days may be over.           Back in 2018, Park was the only batter in the KBO to have a slugging percentage above 0.700, at 0.718. However, that number has been decreasing significantly each season, at 0.560 in 2019 and down to 0.469 this year.           Park has also been striking out more. Last season, Park struck out 117 times throughout 122 games in the regular season, but this year, he already struck out 102 time in 83 games.           “This season, I’m having a hard time figuring out the timing of my batting,” Park said. “As I lost consistency at-bat significantly, I started to lose confidence.”           Park’s number may be getting worse but that doesn’t mean that he’s not worth much for the Heroes. As a veteran, Park has been a huge help to his younger teammates. Since he can’t play, Park has been throwing batting balls to his teammates before the game and advising to the young players.            “Since the start of the season, he’s been saying that he’ll help a lot as a veteran [on the team],” Son said. “Even when his stats weren’t good, he would encourage the younger players in the dugout and has been helping a lot. Since he’s in a situation where he can’t play, he is probably going through the hardest time and is the most disappointed.”           Park is likely to miss the rest of the Heroes’ regular season but things could change if the club advances to the postseason. As the Heroes are ranked second as of Wednesday, they are very likely to head to the playoffs.           Currently, the expected end date to the KBO’s 2020 regular season is Oct. 18, but that could change as some teams will have to play canceled games.           Keeping that in consideration, the postseason this year is expected to be extended until the end of November, at the latest. If the Heroes advance to the Korean Series, it is highly likely that the fans will see Park return to the roster.             BY PARK SO-YOUNG, KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

Last year, batteries were the company’s second largest revenue source, comprising 29 percent.         petrochemicals: 석유화학 제품  potential: 가능성, 가능성 있는  comprise: 구성하다, 구성되다          LG화학 매출의 절반 이상이 석유화학 제품에서 나온다. 하지만 전기차 배터리는 가장 성장 가능성 있는 부문이다. 지난해 배터리는 이 회사 매출의 29%를 구성하는 두 번째로 큰 부문이었다.                       Local analysts and the company have claimed that this year would be the turning point when EV batteries started making profits. In the April-June period, the battery unit reported its largest operating profit of 155.5 billion won ($132.6 million) after losing money for nearly two decades. LG’s EV battery business first saw profits in the fourth quarter of 2018 but went back into the red afterwards.         operating profit: 영업이익. 기본적인 영업 활동을 통해 벌어들이는 이익.  go into the red: 적자를 내다, 빚지다          국내 애널리스트들과 이 회사는 전기차 배터리가 올해를 터닝포인트로 이익을 내기 시작할 것이라고 전망해 왔다. 거의 20년 동안 적자를 내던 이 회사 배터리 부문은 올해 4~6월 역대 최대 규모인 1555억원(1억3260만 달러)의 영업이익을 기록했다.                       Carmakers like Volkswagen and General Motors are trying to make EVs an integral part of their business. Market estimates differ according to research firms and analysts, but the general assessment is that EVs will make up around 20 to 30 percent of vehicle sales by 2030.         integral: 내장된, 필수적인          폭스바겐과 GM 같은 자동차 제조업들은 전기차 사업에 뛰어들고 있다. 조사기관과 애널리스트마다 시장 전망은 다르지만 일반적인 평가는 전기차가 2030년까지 자동차 시장의 20~30%를 차지하게 될 것이라는 것이다.                       “The battery industry is experiencing rapid growth, and the EV battery business has just started to make big profits. We decided this is the optimal time for a spinoff,” LG Chem said in a statement Thursday. “The entity is expected to generate 13 trillion won in revenue this year. Our goal is to hit 30 trillion won in annual revenue by 2024.”         optimal: 최적의  entity: 기관, 단체, 기업 등 독립체          LG화학은 목요일 “배터리 산업의 급속한 성장 및 전기차 배터리 분야의 이익 창출이 본격화 되고 있는 현재 시점이 회사 분할의 적기라고 판단했다”며 “전기차 배터리 부문은 올해 13조원의 매출액을 기록할 것으로 예상되고 있다. 2024년까지 연 매출 30조원을 달성할 계획”이라고 밝혔다.                       Local analysts generally approved of the spinoff. “A lot of LG Chem’s capital expenditure [capex] in recent years was concentrated on batteries. But the battery market is expected to rapidly grow in the next three to four years, which means even more capex will be needed,” said Kim Hyun-tae, BNK Securities analyst.         capital expenditure: 자본 지출. CAPEX. 미래의 이윤 창출, 가치 취득을 위해 지출된 투자 과정에서의 비용.          국내 애널리스트들은 대체로 기업 분할에 대해 긍정적인 입장이다. BNK증권 김현태 애널리스트는 (보고서를 통해) “최근 몇 년간 LG화학의 자본지출(CAPEX)은 배터리 사업부에 집중돼 왔다. 배터리 시장은 향후 3~4년은 빠르게 성장할 전망이고 더 많은 자본지출이 집행돼야 하는 상황”이고 말했다.                       “At a time where other business units need investment as well, continuing the capex focus on batteries alone creates a burden for the company in terms of financing and regarding fairness among business units. It’s better that the battery unit is spun off as a separate corporation to attract and execute funding.”         execute: 실행하다          그는 “다른 사업부도 투자가 필요한 상황에서 배터리 부문만을 위해 투자를 집중하게 되면 회사로서는 자금 조달 측면에서나 타 사업부와의 형평성 측면에서 부담이 된다. 배터리 부문을 독립 법인으로 분할해 자금을 조달하고 투자를 집행하는 것이 더 유리하다”고 분석했다.                       번역:박혜민 경제산업부장 [park.hyemin@joongang.co.kr]   "
214,Moon proposes formally ending Korean War in keynote UN speech,"

     President Moon Jae-in gives a videoconference speech for the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.  [Provided by the Blue House]                President Moon Jae-in in a speech Tuesday urged the United Nations and the international community to support formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War.           ""I hope that the UN and the international community provide support so that we can advance into an era of reconciliation and prosperity through the end-of-war declaration,"" Moon said in the speech, delivered by video to the 75th UN General Assembly. ""The end-of-war declaration will, indeed, open the door to complete denuclearization and permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.""           Moon made the proposal in his pre-recorded keynote address for the UN General Assembly meeting held in New York. The UN decided to hold the event via video link due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Moon's speech was aired early Wednesday morning in Seoul. Among more than 170 leaders who participated in the meeting, Moon was the 10th to speak.           ""In particular, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War,"" Moon said. ""Time has come to remove the tragedy lingering on the Korean Peninsula. The War must end, completely and for good.""           The two Koreas remain in a technical state of war. In 1953, an armistice agreement was signed by the UN Command, North Korea and China to bring a complete ceasefire to hostilities until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.           ""Peace on the Korean Peninsula will guarantee peace in Northeast Asia as a whole and, going one step further, bring positive changes to the world order as well,"" Moon said in his speech. ""I believe it begins with declaring an end to the war, an act that can affirm mutual commitments to peace.""           Moon said an end to the conflict will ""open the door to complete denuclearization."" The stance is a change from his previous position that progress needed to be made toward denuclearization of North Korea as a precondition for the end-of-war declaration.           In his 2018 speech in the UN General Assembly, Moon said, ""I look forward to seeing bold measures for denuclearization implemented among the related countries, leading to the declaration to end the war.""             During the first years of Moon's presidency, expectations were high that inter-Korean relations and North-U.S. relations would see substantive progress toward denuclearization. In 2018, inter-Korean relations progressed rapidly, and Moon held three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that year alone. Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington were also active.           But the sanguine expectations failed to be realized, after the second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in February 2019 produced no deal. Inter-Korean relations also became frozen.           It remains to be seen how North Korea will react to Moon's latest proposal, now that it is not explicitly linked to denuclearization progress.           In his speech, Moon also discussed other issues. He proposed establishing a regional organization to promote cooperation in public health measures and infectious disease control.           ""Hoping that the international community views the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula through the lens of more inclusive international cooperation, I propose today launching a Northeast Asia Cooperation Initiative for Infectious Disease Control and Public Health, whereby North Korea participates as a member along with China, Japan, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea,"" he said, using South Korea's formal name.           ""A cooperative architecture that guarantees collective protection of life and safety will lay the groundwork for North Korea to have its security guaranteed by engaging with the international community.""           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]    "

216,Nikola fraud accusations hit Korean investors hard,"

     Trevor Milton who recently resigned as the executive chairman of Nikola speaks during presentation of its new full-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell battery trucks in partnership with CNH Industrial, at an event in Turin, Italy, December 2, 2019. [REUTERS]               With the shares of Nasdaq-listed Nikola down 19 percent on Monday, and far from their all-time high, Korean investors in the U.S. hydrogen and electric automotive company have not made as much money as had been hoped, while some may have lost a bundle.           Phoenix-based Nikola has been accused by a short-seller of being a little more than bluff, and news reports indicate that the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating. The company had published videos of one of its vehicles rolling down a hill as if it was driving under its own power.           Hanwha Energy and Hanwha General Chemical purchased a combined 6.1 percent of the company for $100 million in 2018 ahead of the June 2020 initial public offering. The shares are still worth an estimated $610 million, though the holding is far down from the $2 billion it was probably worth in early June.           The shares peaked at 93.99 on June 9.           Neither Hanwha Energy nor Hanwha General Chemical are listed. Hanwha General Chemical is 39.16 percent owned by Hanwha Energy and 36.05 percent by Hanwha Solutions.             Hanwha Solutions closed 2.79 percent lower Tuesday, while shares of Hanwha Corporation plummeted 4.56 percent the same day.             Hanwha Q Cells is the exclusive provider to Nikola of solar panels, which will be used to generate clean energy.             Retail investors in Korea lost approximately 34 billion won ($29 million) as Nikola plunged on Nasdaq on Monday.           According to data compiled by Korea Securities Depository Tuesday, investors in Korea were holding Nikola shares worth 170 billion won as of Monday. With the Nikola shares falling by almost 20 percent, value of those held by retail investors here plunged by about 33.9 billion won.             The data showed that retail investors in Korea have net purchased Nikola shares worth $283 million since June. Nikola came in 18th spot in terms of shares value held by retail investors in Korea as of Monday.

218,"Flu vaccines left out of the fridge, program halted","






     People wait outside the Korea Association of Health Promotion’s Gyeonggi branch in Suwon Tuesday to get flu shots, which they will pay for. [YONHAP]         A government project offering free flu shots to the nation’s old and young was abruptly halted Tuesday after health authorities announced faulty procedures in deliveries. Some vaccines were left at room temperature as they were being shipped instead of being refrigerated.           The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said Tuesday that the vaccines in question had not been administered to anyone and that previously distributed vaccines seem to be safe because no one has reported any “unusual reaction” to the shots so far.           The KDCA highlighted there was “nothing wrong in production processes” of the flu shots, saying they were verified by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety before being sent to medical facilities by a local pharmaceutical company, when a “problem” in shipping procedures occurred.           How that problem was discovered was not revealed by the KDCA Tuesday, neither did the agency say how many vaccine doses were left at room temperature or for how long. The vaccines were supposed to be kept at temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35.6 to 46.4 degrees Fahrenheit), and any storage temperature above this range can destroy their potency.           Health authorities said the blunder was found among a batch of vaccines that were to be given to 5 million people aged between 13 and 18 starting from Tuesday in accordance to a central government schedule for free flu vaccines.           Until the government verifies the viability of the 5 million doses, the entire free vaccine scheme will be put on hold, the KDCA said.           If authorities conclude there’s nothing wrong with the 5 million doses of vaccines, they will be administered and the rest of the program will restart, the KDCA said, adding it expects the verification procedure to take about two weeks.           KDCA Commissioner Jeong Eun-kyeong said it was “difficult to prejudge” whether the government would discard any doses that were left at room temperature, saying they would have to be examined by authorities first.           The KDCA said it would investigate Shinsung Pharm, a company based in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul, which was in charge of delivering the vaccines.           The government’s free flu shot initiative kicked off earlier this month as health authorities vowed to inoculate 19 million people, about 37 percent of the total population, this fall and winter in order to prevent a “double pandemic” of the coronavirus and seasonal flu, which have similar symptoms.            Those who are eligible for free shots are people between the ages of six months and 18 years old, pregnant women and senior citizens aged 62 and older. Everyone else is recommended to get vaccinated at a nearby medical facility with their own money, which costs about 30,000 won ($26).           The free flu shots have been administered since Sept. 8 starting with children. Jeong said Tuesday that health officials would do their best to bring the program back on schedule by no later than October.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN, HWANG SOO-YEON   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
219,Mount Halla's fir forest is withering,"

     Korean firs growing at an altitude of 1,800 meters (5,906 feet) on the Seongpanak Trail on Mount Halla on Jeju Island are dying en masse as seen in August this year. [JO HYUN-WOO]         The Korean fir forest on Jeju Island's Mount Halla is the largest in the world.           But Korean firs are dying, tangible evidence of global warming.           Firs, most famously used as Christmas trees, are an endangered species globally.           The Korean fir, Abies koreana E.H. Wilson, is an indigenous evergreen coniferous species native to altitudes above 1,000 meters (3,280 feet), including on Korea’s two tallest peaks, Mount Halla and Mount Jiri. It was recognized internationally in 1920.              Korean fir trees in the same place in 2009. [NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOREST SCIENCE]         When JoongAng Ilbo reporters on Aug. 14 trekked Mount Halla’s Seongpanak Trail as a part of the newspaper’s 55th anniversary series on climate change, the temperature soared to 36.3 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit).             The Hallasan National Park is a Unesco Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site known for its lush ecosystem.           After they reached a shelter around 1,500 meters above sea level, reporters could spot the dark green pyramid-shaped trees. They also felt smokiness in the air.           A shocking sight awaited the trekkers at an altitude of around 1,700 meters, where there should traditionally be the highest concentration of firs.           Trees were collapsed over the trail, roots up, like the site of an explosion. Leaves were fallen and branches were withered.             Some 80 percent of trees at an altitude of 1,700 to 1,800 meters have withered away, according to experts.             Kim Jin, a researcher with the National Institute of Forest Science, who accompanied the reporters, has trekked the trail for 20 years, photographing the fir trees and keeping records.           “The fir trees are not rooted deeply, and their roots have a tendency to spread sideways,” said Kim. “Because roots spread to the bottoms of rocks, there have been repeated cases of trees falling over after heavy rainfall or strong winds.”             Just 20 years ago, the fir forest on Mount Halla was lush and green. Starting in the 2000s, as the snowfall level in the wintertime gradually declined, the firs began to show signs of withering.           Snow melted earlier, and the firs lacked sufficient moisture in the springtime, having an adverse effect on their growth.           The average temperature on Jeju Island has risen 1.2 degrees Celsius compared to 50 years ago, according to the Jeju Regional Meteorological Administration, averaging 16.6 degrees from 2009 to 2018, compared to 15.4 degrees from 1961 to 1970. Likewise, days with snowfall during the same period dropped by half from 12 days to 5.9 days.           More frequent typhoons and heavy rainfall in the summertime further battered the already weak firs.           According to the Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Government’s Hallasan Research Institute, the rate of withering of firs sharply increased from 17.8 percent in 1996 to 47.6 percent in 2014. In the span of a decade between 2006 and 2015, some 112.3 hectares of firs have disappeared.           This year, Jeju’s mountains saw 1,000 millimeters (39 inches) of rainfall and have faced a series of powerful typhoons.           Kim said, “When I climbed Mount Halla after the most recent typhoon passed, weaker trees had fallen over, roots up.”             Environmental experts are warning that the extinction of Korean firs could bring calamity to the Mount Halla ecosystem.             “It isn’t an exaggeration to say that the acceleration pedal has been pressed toward extinction on Mount Halla within 10 to 20 years,” said Seo Jae-cheol, a standing committee member of the nonprofit environmental group Green Korea. “I worry that the Korean fir will end up being recorded as the first indigenous species to become extinct on the Korean Peninsula due to climate change.”            Kim said, “Goodyeras bloom below forests in the high altitudes of Mount Halla and have a symbiotic relationship [with the firs]. If there are no fir trees, then flowers species like the Goodyera may also become extinct.”           BY KANG CHAN-SU, CHUN KWON-PIL, SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

221,Parties get closer to deal on 4th extra budget,"

     From left, Democratic Party floor leader Kim Tae-nyeon and People Power Party floor leader Joo Ho-young, fist bump while holding an agreement on the fourth supplementary budget at the National Assembly in Seoul on Tuesday. [YONHAP]               The ruling Democratic Party and opposition People Power Party both made compromises on a fourth supplementary budget of 7.8 trillion won ($6.9 billion), coming one step closer to a final deal.             If approved, four supplementary budgets totaling almost 67 trillion won will be spent this year, a record and a signal of the government's desperation to tackle an economic crisis touched off by the global pandemic.           The two parties, who have been negotiating since late Monday, agreed to cut back a widely ridiculed 20,000-won telecommunication bill subsidy that was supposed to be given to every Korean.             The parties agreed to limit the payments to people between the ages of 16 and 34 and senior citizens 65 or older.             As a result, 530 billion won was cut from the initial proposal of 930 billion won for the subsidy.             The Democratic Party said it decided to exclude people in their 40s and 50s because most have stable incomes.           In return for lowering the subsidy, the Democratic Party was able to gain some ground on financing of vaccinations, specifically increasing the budget for purchasing coronavirus vaccines. The budget would be used to buy coronavirus vaccines for 10.37 million additional people.            The government had earmarked money in an earlier supplementary budget for vaccinating 30 million people if a successful vaccine is developed.           The budget for free influenza vaccines was increased as well. An additional 1.05 million people will be eligible for free flu shots including 350,000 people with disabilities and 700,000 people with low incomes who receive government subsidy on medical bills.       Currently the government has a supply of flu shots for 19 million people.           The opposition party strongly opposed the phone bill subsidy since it was first proposed by the Democratic Party.             During a meeting with President Moon Jae-in at the Blue House on Sept. 9, ruling party leader Lee Nak-yon said peoples' phone bills went up during the pandemic because they spent more time on computers and their smart phones due to social distancing measures.             The opposition party claimed the giveaway was a waste that would have no ripple effect on the general economy. It said it would only benefit the large telecommunication companies. It demanded more free flu shots.           The fourth supplementary budget also expanded a government child support subsidy.           The initial plan was to give 200,000 won to families for each child in elementary school or younger. That was an expansion on a previous program giving 400,000 won to families for each child aged 7 or younger.           The revised budget has been expanded to include middle schoolers aged between 13 and 15. Families will receive 150,000 won for each middle-school child.           Additionally, room salons, a Korean form of hostess bar, and cola tech joints, no-alcohol dance clubs for teenagers, will also be eligible for a 2-million-won subsidy for small businesses.           Previously the government agreed to give a maximum 2 million won to small businesses negatively impacted by heightened social distancing regulations such as internet cafes and noraebang (singing rooms). That excluded room salons and cola-tech joints.            “We are not trying to promote such entertainment, but these are businesses that have suffered heavily as they were forced to close [during the heightened social distancing],” said Park Hong-keun, a Democratic Party lawmaker. “If we do not support businesses that strictly cooperated in the quarantine efforts, we won’t be able to ask them to do the same when another major crisis emerges.”           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

223,Moon issues stern warning to potential Foundation Day protesters,"

     Protesters rally in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, on Aug. 15, Korea's Liberation Day. The demonstration led to over 600 coronavirus infections, with the number still growing. [YONHAP]          President Moon Jae-in Tuesday threatened to use “stern measures” against protesters planning to take the streets over the upcoming holidays, saying authorities will show zero tolerance toward anyone who attempts to wreak havoc on society.             Moon made the remarks while presiding over a cabinet meeting at the Blue House eight days before the Chuseok holidays, which kick off on Sept. 30, and 11 days before Foundation Day on Oct. 3.             Hundreds of right-wing civic groups have relayed plans to protest in downtown Seoul on Foundation Day, a national holiday, despite warnings from health officials and police not to congregate for fear of spreading the coronavirus.           A huge anti-Moon rally that was held in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, on Aug. 15 Liberation Day has often been mentioned as a dire reference point: At least 622 coronavirus patients have been linked to the rally as of Tuesday noon, and the cluster is still growing.                              Nationwide, Korea added 61 new cases Monday, the third day in a row that the day-to-day figure remained below 100, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said Tuesday morning. There were 82 new cases Saturday and 70 on Sunday.           By law, it’s illegal to rally in large numbers in Seoul under the Seoul Metropolitan Government's ban on any congregations involving 10 or more people through Oct. 11. Police warned they would arrest anyone who participates in rallies exceeding that limit.           Moon on Tuesday disparaged protesters who have refused to walk back their plans to protest on Oct. 3, saying such “antisocial crimes” cannot be supported under the pretext of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech when they “threaten the safety of the community and crush the lives” of members in society.           Ruling Democratic Party (DP) Chairman Lee Nak-yon called on Korea’s police chief, Commissioner General Kim Chang-yong, during a Tuesday meeting to block any efforts from protesters to hold rallies in the coming days, and to ""show that governmental authority is alive.”           Kim replied that the possibility of the coronavirus spreading between protesters was “real,” as seen in the Aug. 15 rally, and stressed that police would block anyone who tries to demonstrate in large groups “from the point they start to congregate.”           “If they refuse to follow [our] orders to disperse, we will disperse them ourselves,” Kim warned, adding legal charges will definitely be pressed “without any exception.”           Former Reps. Kim Jin-tae and Min Kyung-wook, both of whom were members of the United Future Party — the predecessor of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) — and participated in the Aug. 15 anti-Moon rally, suggested having demonstrators drive their cars out onto the street to protest from their vehicles. Whether right-wing groups will pick up on that idea remains to be seen.           Among 61 people who were diagnosed with the coronavirus Monday, according to data from the KDCA, 51 were local cases: 20 in Seoul, 14 in Gyeonggi, five in Busan, four in North Gyeongsang, two each in Incheon, Gangwon and North Chungcheong and one each in Ulsan and South Gyeongsang.           Ten people were believed to have contracted the virus abroad: four in the United States, two each in Uzbekistan and India and one each in Russia and Turkey.           Three people died Monday, bringing total deaths to 388, while 193 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 20,441. As of Monday at midnight, there were 23,106 coronavirus patients in all.             BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
224,Eastar Jet's pilot union pushes for receivership of airline,"

     Pilot unions hold a press event in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Tuesday, demanding the struggling Eastar Jet file for court receivership and withdraw the decision to lay off workers. [NEWS1]               Eastar Jet’s pilot union on Tuesday requested the cash-strapped airline file for court receivership and withdraw its plan to lay off more than 600 employees.          Though there are concerns for bankruptcy, the pilot union is demanding the company file for court receivership to receive wages not paid since February.           Receivership is a corporate rehabilitation procedure administered by the court. Under the court receivership, employees are entitled to a priority claim for unpaid wages. In Korea bankruptcy, assets are sold to reimburse creditors.           “Eastar Jet management should immediately withdraw the decision to lay off employees, and it should file for court receivership,” the pilot union said in a statement Tuesday.           Pilot unions from Eastar Jet and other airlines held a press event making the arguments in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Tuesday.           On Sept. 7, Eastar Jet announced the laying off of 605 employees, saying it will only keep the 414 employees that are necessary to operate six aircraft. It plans to lay off 35 employees who are on maternity leave and 80 repair workers. It took voluntary resignations in August, but only 98 people applied.           “Employees' layoff should be the last measure taken by the company in the process of corporate rehabilitation. Employee layoffs should come after unpaid vacation, voluntary resignation, court receivership and debt settlement. If the management hasn't mismanaged the company’s financial affairs, it should file for court receivership,” said the pilot union.           The pilot union also requested employment maintenance subsidies, which the government granted to businesses affected by Covid-19. The airline didn't register for the subsidies due to lack of funds, according to the pilot union.           “Excluding Eastar Jet, all airlines are overcoming difficulties through the government’s employment of maintenance subsidies. Only Eastar Jet didn't receive the subsidy because it did not pay 500 million won [$429,000] of employment insurance.” The pilot union added, “We can’t help but doubt the company wasn't interested in employment maintenance at all, but was only focused on selling the company.”           They once again demanded Eastar Jet founder Lee Sang-jik, a Democratic Party lawmaker, take responsibility for the crisis.           “Rep. Lee should make a public apology and find ways to help employees as the founder of Eastar Jet,” the pilot union said, while urging the government for active support.           Since Jeju Air abandoned the acquisition of Eastar Jet in July, Eastar Jet has been trying to find another buyer. It is currently in talks with eight possible candidates.           Eastar Jet CEO Choi Jong-gu said last week that a sale is the only option.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleLee Su-ji resigns as director of Eastar HoldingsEastar to cut half its workers, reduce fleet, ahead of saleEastar pilot's union demands it cancel layoff plansEastar Jet founder reported to prosecution by pilot's union"
225,Prosecutors raid homes of Choo's son and others implicated in scandal,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae attends the National Assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee on Monday.  [YONHAP]                Prosecutors said Tuesday they raided the home and office of Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae’s son as they investigate allegations that he received preferential treatment when he served the military in 2017.             The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office said the raids targeting Choo’s 27-year-old son, surnamed Seo, happened on Monday, while on Saturday they raided the homes of a former military captain and a former aide to Choo for their suspected roles in the scandal.             Choo and her family have been battling allegations that Seo received special treatment when he was serving in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, from November 2016 through August 2018. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).             Several whistle-blowers have alleged Seo was let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of a sick leave in June 2017, which had already been extended once. Suspicions were raised that Choo or her husband had called on the Ministry of National Defense to get a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days. Choo has consistently denied the accusations.             Choo's aide at the time is also suspected of having contacted the military to extend the leave. Choo said she has not checked with the aide about the allegation.             According to the sources in the prosecution, the captain and Choo’s aide had at least three phone conversations between June 5 and 27, 2017. They believe the phone talks were to arrange an extension for Seo’s leave.           The prosecution has recovered their call and text message records to see if they had additional contact. Prosecutors are also looking into the possibility that other people were involved in the unusual extension of leave.             Meanwhile, Choo generated fresh controversy on Monday in a hot mic moment, in which she used blunt language to characterize an opposition lawmaker who has raised suspicions about her son’s military service for months.             Choo attended the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee meeting on Monday evening. After opposition lawmakers grilled Choo about the allegations concerning her son, the committee went into recess around 7:37 p.m. Choo, then, had a conversation with Defense Minister Suh Wook, who was sitting next to her.             Although microphones in front of the two ministers were turned off, Choo’s voice was still aired live on the National Assembly’s broadcasting system.             “You must feel very uncomfortable,” Suh told Choo.           “I am dumbfounded,” Choo responded. “It is good that he is now a lawmaker, not a prosecutor. He must have framed many innocent people.”             Choo was referring to Rep. Kim Do-eup, chief negotiator for the People Power Party (PPP) on the committee and a former prosecutor. Earlier during the session, Kim raised new suspicions about Choo’s son. Kim accused the Ministry of National Defense of having tried to conceal the fact that outside pressure was placed on the military to select Seo as a military interpreter for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.             Kim revealed a document from the ministry, dated on Sept. 9, 2020. The ministry recorded that the military originally planned to select volunteers, but changed the method to drawing lots in response to too many outside requests made to select Seo. The ministry was obviously aware that improper requests were made to select Seo, Kim said, but attempted to conceal its findings.           After Kim’s remarks, the committee went into recess and Choo criticized him in the hot mic blunder.             When the committee resumed its session, the PPP strongly criticized Choo. Rep. Yoo Sang-bum of the PPP told Choo that it was not her first hot-mic gaffe.             During a July 27 session of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, Choo jeered at PPP Rep. Yoon Han-hong, who had raised suspicions about Choo’s son. “Go write a novel,” Choo said at the time, prompting angry responses from the opposition lawmakers.             “You must remember the chaos after your [July] remarks,” Yoo told Choo on Monday. “How dare you insult a lawmaker because you don’t like his question?”           Choo responded, “I offer an apology for the smooth continuation of this committee meeting.”             BY KIM JI-HYE, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "
226,U.S. says it will stop Iran-North Korea missile exchanges,"

     Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, right, shakes hands with North Korea's Foreign Minister at the time, Ri Yong-ho, during a meeting in Tehran on August 7, 2018. [AFP/YONHAP]               Washington is concerned about North Korea’s cooperation with Iran on long-range missile development and will do anything it can to prevent it, said a U.S. State Department special envoy.             Special Representative for Iran and Venezuela Elliott Abrams made the comment in response to a reporter’s question about potential ties between Pyongyang and Tehran on weapons development, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump announced United Nations sanctions against Iran were back in force.             The unilateral measures, coming less than two months before election day on Nov. 3, have not been reciprocated by other UN Security Council members like China, Russia or even U.S. allies Britain and France, which have urged the Trump administration to respect the nuclear deal made with Tehran during the Obama years, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Jcpoa).            On Sunday, Reuters reported a senior U.S. official requesting anonymity saying, without citing evidence, that Iran had resumed cooperation with North Korea in developing long-range missiles, “including the transfer of critical parts.”             No details were given as to when such exchanges began, stopped or started again, Reuters said.             In a press conference announcing Trump’s executive order restoring sanctions on Iran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a warning threatening punishment for any country that continues to trade arms with Tehran.           “Our actions today are a warning that should be heard worldwide,” Pompeo said. “No matter who you are, if you violate the UN arms embargo on Iran, you risk sanctions.”           Though its contours are unclear, Pyongyang and Tehran share an extensive history of cooperation on strategic munitions development going back decades, a relationship that some experts have called a de facto alliance that not only includes exchanges in technicians and arms but also in key technology.             In mid-2016, North Korea tested its Hwasong-10 intermediate-range ballistic missile, also known as the Musudan, with an estimated maximum range of 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles). The following year, Iran tested a medium-range missile, later dubbed the Khorramshahr, that closely resembled the Musudan though with a significantly reduced range of around 2,500 kilometers.             The Khorramshahr is believed to have vastly expanded Tehran’s strike capabilities in the region, and, had it the range of the Musudan, would have given the country the ability to target several European capitals from Iranian territory.             Other experts noted that Iran tested a Shahab-3 or Shahab-2 medium-range ballistic missile in January 2017 based on North Korea’s Rodong or Scud-C missiles.             Tehran is also believed to have used its Qiam series missiles — based on the North’s Scud-C system — to launch attacks on American bases in Iraq last January.             But the relationship is reciprocal, also benefitting Pyongyang’s missile development capabilities, experts have said.             According to Pyongyang-analysis website 38 North, the North’s test of its Pukkuksong-1 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) in 2016, which used solid propellant rocket motors similar to that used in Iran’s Sejjil missile, raised the likelihood the technology was obtained from Tehran.             The common fear analysts and experts around the world have outlined is the extent to which Iran has access to North Korea’s most dangerous missiles to date, the Hwasong-14 and 15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).              The first stage 80-ton engine used for both missiles, based on a variant allegedly obtained from Ukraine for the Hwasong-12, is believed to have been shared with Iran.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyueok@joongang.co.kr]         "

                           A screen shows the closing figure for the Kospi in a trading room at Hana Bank in Jung District, central Seoul, on Tuesday. [YONHAP]               Stocks dipped more than 2 percent on Tuesday, as investor sentiment worsened over dimming hopes for recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in major economies. The won fell against the dollar.           The Kospi tumbled 56.8 points, or 2.38 percent, to close at 2,332.59.           Trading volume was high at about 1 billion shares worth some 17.5 trillion won ($15 billion), with losers outnumbering gainers 816 to 80.           The Kospi plunged after losing nearly 1 percent in the previous session.            The decline is largely blamed on strong foreign and institutional sell-off, driven by slow progress in U.S. stimulus talks and fears of economic lockdown in Europe, analysts said.           ""Fears of possible lockdown in Europe and the stalled [U.S.] stimulus talks seem to have worsened the tech valuation problem at home,"" Choi Yoo-joon, a researcher at Shinhan Financial Investment, said.           Foreigners sold a net 230 billion won and institutions dumped a net 769 billion won. Individuals bought a net 992 billion won.           Stocks losses widened after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said a full recovery from the pandemic will take a considerably long time.           In a related move, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the United States may experience ""at least one more cycle"" of the virus by the end of the year.           The Kospi's fall was further accelerated by investors' profit-taking before the Chuseok holiday, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, when U.S. political uncertainties are expected to rise, local analysts said.           In Seoul, most large caps closed lower.           Market bellwether Samsung Electronics lost 1.69 percent to 58,200 won, and No. 2 chipmaker SK hynix dipped 3.79 percent to 81,300 won.           Pharmaceutical firm Samsung Biologics retreated 1.22 percent to 731,000 won, and Celltrion shed 3.77 percent to 268,000 won.           Internet portal Naver dipped 2.57 percent to 284,500 won, with its rival Kakao down 3.16 percent to 353,000 won.           Chemical maker LG Chem gained 1.91 percent to 639,000 won, and rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI edged up 0.11 percent to 446,500 won.           Hyundai Motor shed 2.97 percent to 179,900 won, while steelmaker Posco advanced 1.83 percent to 194,500 won.           The local currency closed at 1,165 won per dollar, up 7 won from the previous session's close.           The Kosdaq dropped 24.27 points, or 2.80 percent, to close at 842.72.             Bond prices, which move inversely to yields, closed higher.

229,ITC agrees to review its decision in Botox dispute,"

     Daewoong Pharmaceutical's Nabota. [DAEWOONG PHARMACEUTICAL]               The Botox war between Medytox and Daewoong Pharmaceutical has taken an unexpected turn as the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) decided to partially review its initial determination in favor of Medytox.          In its initial determination in July, the ITC concluded that Nabota — Daewoong’s botulinum toxin product currently sold in the U.S. market as Jeuveau — was made with bacteria and intellectual property stolen from Medytox. If that same conclusion is retained in the final determination in November, Daewoong’s Nabota would be banned from the country for 10 years.           Following the decision, Daewoong filed a complaint asking for a review of the initial determination, claiming the conclusion was flawed and relied on the opinion of Medytox experts. The request was accepted by the ITC.           According to its statement, the ITC will once again examine the existence of trade secret, misappropriation and subject matter jurisdiction on whether the U.S. government body is eligible to rule in a dispute between non-U.S. companies.           The complaint that provoked the U.S. ITC procedure in the first place was filed by Medytox and its U.S. partner Allergan in January 2019.           Daewoong has claimed Allergan is not the direct owner of the trade secret in question and therefore the U.S. ITC does not have jurisdiction in the matter.           For the review, the Commission also requested both parties answer how the Medytox strain is different from other Hall A-hyper strains which were first discovered the 1920s. Hall A-hyper strains are one of the manufacturing secrets Medytox claims has been stole by Daewoong.           Daewoong welcomed the decision, calling the review an “all-over re-examination.”           “The ITC practically accepted all of our objections,” it said in a Tuesday statement. “Not only did it decide to review juridical issues, but made an exceptional decision to re-examine the core facts on theft of strains and production methods.”           Medytox, on the other hand, brushed off such claims, emphasizing that the review was “partial” and a “conventional” part of ITC disputes.           “Partial reviews of the initial determination are a conventional procedure that commonly occurs in ITC suits. It rarely overturns results in the final determination,” the company said in a statement. “The initial determination was based on scientific facts and evidence. We are confident the final determination will ultimately accept the initial ruling.”           The final ruling of the Medytox versus Daewoong Pharmaceutical case is slated for Nov. 6.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON  [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
230,Hyundai Motor and union come to a wage freeze deal,"

     Hyundai Motor and its labor union came to a tentative agreement on Monday to freeze wages. [YONHAP]         Hyundai Motor and its union came to a tentative agreement Monday evening to freeze wages, with both sides agreeing on the need for cooperation to survive the coronavirus pandemic.           It is the first time in 11 years that the union agreed to freeze wages, and the third time ever.           The first time was in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. The second was in 2009 after the global financial meltdown.           Hyundai Motor’s labor union, known for hardline strikes, agreed on a wage freeze for 2020, a regular bonus worth 150 percent of their monthly salary, and another bonus of 1.2 million won ($1,000) as an encouragement to overcome Covid-19 difficulties.           The union will vote on the agreement on Sept. 25.           “The union and management agreed that the economic and social situation in Korea has been difficult due to Covid-19,” the company said in a release.           “We agreed that we need to work together in order to overcome the crisis in the auto industry amid a global economic recession.”           It took 40 days to come to the agreement, and there were no walkouts during the negotiations.           It was the second straight year that the union and management were able to come to a temporary agreement without walkouts.           The two sides pledged to cooperate to enhance the quality of the cars produced, which would eventually lead to stable employment. They agreed to strengthen a quality control team at each manufacturing plant and a feedback system from customers.           Hyundai Motor’s union is infamous for militant actions. Since its foundation in 1987, the union staged either partial or full walkouts every year to demand higher wages, except for in 2007 and 2009-2011.           In 2016, when the union staged its first full strike in 12 years, it lead to disruption of at least 3 trillion won worth of production.           Last year, when the union and management came to a deal without a walkout, Hyundai Motor posted a 52 percent year-on-year jump in its operating profit.           Other carmakers in Korea are still negotiating with their unions.           GM Korea’s union is demanding monthly wages be raised by 120,304 won and a regular bonus worth 400 percent of the monthly salary plus 6 million won. Renault Samsung Motors’ union is demanding a wage increase of 71,687 won and a one-time bonus of 7 million won.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

From the catchiest of songs to never-before-seen concepts and TV shows that feature the journey to debut — agencies have mustered all their brainpower to make sure that their band’s entry into the industry does not go unnoticed. Now, FNC Entertainment is using a tactic to debut its new boy band P1Harmony that has never been seen before: a film.           “P1H: A New World Begins“ is set to hit local theaters next month on Oct. 8. It is the first-ever film to revolve around the background story — commonly referred to as universe, like the Marvel cinematic universe — of a K-pop idol band. There has been various content aimed at showing a band’s universe narrative, such as the “Save Me” webtoon series based on BTS that were released on Naver Webtoon last year, but never a full-length film.              An image from the film ""P1H: A New World Begins,"" where Theo flaunts his dexterity with guns while catching virus-spreading drones. [FNC ENTERTAINMENT]               Directed by Chang Gamdok, which means Director Chang and whose real name is Yoon Hong-seung, the film features the six members of P1Harmony. Theo, Jongseob, Intak, Jiung, Soul and Keeho are the children of hope in a world ruined by the Alcor Virus, which rids people of their reason and only leaves their most violent and aggressive behavior, leading them to attack each other until death. Drones that identify people by their voices roam the earth to infect people with the virus, and the members of P1H are the only hope there is to return the world to normal.            A word of advice before watching: This is only the beginning.           The film itself is like a cinematic introduction to the group’s debut, which means that the movie finishes in an open ending that leaves a lot of questions. The characters are spread out in three different times: Theo, Jongseob and Soul in the future after the virus has taken over; Jiung and Keeho in the past where the virus has yet to be developed; and Intak in the present 2020 where the virus has just began to spread in Korea. They each have special powers and abilities that will help save the world in different ways, but no one knows exactly how.              Chang Gamdok, center, poses with members of P1Harmony on Tuesday prior to the online press conference.

[FNC ENTERTAINMENT]               According to Chang Gamdok, who co-wrote the script along with Heo A-reum, making a film wasn't always the plan. FNC Entertainment first planned to write a web novel of the universe, but changed the plan to producing a video series “to better show the talents of the members,” which is why Chang was offered the job.           “With every other film, we write the scenario and then cast the actors and get investment,” Chang told local press on Tuesday during an online press conference with the members of P1Harmony.           “But with this film, I had to start with the members and then come up with the story. This was so exciting, because it was a chance to think about how we would really expand the horizons of an idol group into cultural entertainers and watch them evolve. How can it be done and what story will allow that to happen? We started with the very basic questions and that was just such a fun experience.”              Members of P1Harmony pose for photos on Monday for the press preview for the movie ""P1H: A New World Begins"" at the Lotte Cinema Konkuk University branch in eastern Seoul. From left: Theo, Jongseob, Intak, Jiung, Soul and Keeho. [NEWS1]               To come up with the storyline, the director started by figuring out each member. They all gave him the results of their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality tests and held long interviews with Chang to help him figure out who they were and what characters they could portray. The characters thus turned out to be quite similar to the members in real life.           “I think, because the characters within the work are quite similar to who we are in real life, it will help us focus better on our music in the future, as well as showing the rest of the story within our universe and other ideas,” said Jiung. “Our work in the future will be organically related to the universe, so watching the film will allow people to predict the overall vibe of our debut album.”              A star-studded cast of actors are featured in the film ""P1H: A New World Begins."" Clockwise from top left: Actors Jung Jin-young, Jung Hae-in, Jung Yong-hwa, Choi Yeo-jin and Kim Seol-hyun. [FNC ENTERTAINMENT]               The debut date for P1Harmony hasn’t been set yet, but it will be within October, according to FNC Entertainment. FNC is home to some of the biggest groups in K-pop, such as boy bands FT Island and CNBlue as well as girl group AOA, as well as some of the most prominent actors. For the film “P1H,” actors Jung Jin-young, Jung Yong-hwa, Kim Seol-hyun, Jung Hae-in and entertainer Yoo Jae-suk took part to add some extra star power to the cast.           The idea of a virus-stricken world coincides with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, but the film's concept was conceived before the outbreak. The members of P1Harmony still hope that everyone can cheer up during the hard times and wished that their upcoming film and music will help.           “In the film, the world loses peace and harmony because of the virus,” said Keeho. “But we come together as a team in order to bring that back. We wish to spread the message of hope through the film. We hope to bring energy and consolation to everyone going through hard times with our music and work.”              An image from the film ""P1H: A New World Begins,"" where character Chaeyun reveals her special abilities. [FNC ENTERTAINMENT]               Aside from the members’ amateur acting skills and how only two female characters are given names despite the other female characters’ significance within the story, this never-before-seen promotional method is worth the watch. Not only does it leave a huge impact on the audience, but it also helps people memorize each of the members' names — which is often a problem for debuting K-pop bands. The film was initially planned as a series, and so sequels will definitely follow, according to Chang, who hoped that ensuing work will allow the audience to witness the members maturing over time.           “I think being the first is incredibly meaningful,” said Jiung. “We have always thought about novelty and sought to achieve it. I think this work has allowed us to do that, which made us so happy and excited while preparing for it. I think the film will be a large and fertile land for our future music to grow on. We feel nothing but happiness for the land that will allow us to grow the tree of our music.”           BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
232,Choi Chae-heung gives the Lions something to roar about,"

     Samsung Lions pitcher Choi Chae-heung celebrates after tossing a complete shutout during a game against the LG Twins at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in southern Seoul on Sept. 13. [NEWS1]                Samsung Lions starter Choi Chae-heung may be pitching for a struggling team, but it doesn't seem to be holding him back much.           At least not all the time. Although Choi has made headlines for his strong performance this season, it hasn't all been plain sailing.            In fact, Choi may have a claim on the worst game of the season. Back on Aug. 12, during the Lions’ game against the Doosan Bears, Choi gave up 17 hits and 11 runs throughout five innings, making the worst kind of history in the process.           Giving up 17 hits in a single game ties the KBO record in terms of the most number of hits. Since Choi was having a pretty good season, his historically bad result came as a big surprise. Due to that one game, his ERA shot up from 3.42 to 4.52.           Luckily, that game seems to be an anomaly. Choi doesn't appear to have been shaken up and quickly returned to form.           Although Choi’s ERA for the season is still pretty high at 4.16 with seven wins and six losses, he still has at least one performance that's especially memorable for a good reason. During a game against the LG Twins on Sept. 13, Choi tossed a complete shutout. Throughout nine innings, he gave up four hits while striking out 10 and giving up no runs.           This was Choi’s first-ever shutout.           As he is slowly getting better with the end of the season approaching, Choi has become the starter that Lions manager Heo Sam-young can rely on. Looking at the team's starting rotation, Baek Jung-hyun has been sent down to the Futures League due to injury while Won Tae-in has started to fall apart.           But with Choi’s performance, the Lions still have some balance to their starting rotation, led by Choi and foreign pitcher David Buchanan. Having fully earned his spot in the Lions’ rotation in only his third season in the KBO, Choi has one goal, to fulfill the regulated innings for a starting pitcher this season.           Below are edited excerpts from an interview with Choi.               Q. You made quite an impact with a complete shutout against the LG Twins on Sept. 13. Did anything feel different ahead of that game?          A. For some reason, I did feel good that day, better than usual. My control of my fastball was good. That's how I got to strike out so many batters. As the weather cools down I think my pace is picking up.               Q. Before the complete game, your worst game was against the Doosan Bears on Aug. 12. What changed since then?          A. Rather than doing something differently, I told myself to continue doing what I’ve been doing. I started to think that the main role of a starter is to be consistent. Although I played badly that day, I continued pitching with the thought that “I’ll do well if I do it consistently.” As I started telling myself that, I feel like my performance is also getting better.              Q. Your performance this season has improved compared to last year. What changed?          A. I think I’ve gained more confidence compared to last season. Since spring training, my control of my pitches were all right. Since I wanted to play as a full-time starter, I’ve done a lot of weight training to build my strength and I think that worked out well.               Q. Your batting average against right-handed batters went down. What changes did you make?        A. My batting average against right-handed batters was lower [than against lefty batters] last year too.            This season, my changeup is working well. When I was pitching against left-handed batters last year, I had a hard time pitching inside, more toward their body. Due to this, I made it easier for the batters to hit, which is why my batting average against [vs. left-handed batter] was higher [at 0.316].            This season, by pitching more toward the inside of the body, I’m improving on my weakness. But by throwing more pitches like that, I'm also hitting the batters more as well.                 Q. What is the biggest success behind lowering your batting average compared to last year?        A. I think being able to throw pitches toward the batter’s body with more confidence is the [biggest] reason. Since I’m being more confident [with my pitches] I can feel that my pitches have gotten a lot better than last year. For pitchers, routine is important and I’m in the process of figuring it out.               Q. After you attended Hanyang University, you switched your position from being a batter to a pitcher. What triggered you to change your mind?          A. I saw a limit in my development as a batter. I had more fun as a pitcher and I wanted to challenge myself with a new position. I requested a meeting with my manager regarding a position change and at the time, our manager accepted it by telling me that “I thought of you as a pitcher.”            Since the training for a pitcher and batter is different, the process was tough in the beginning. I was able to adjust quickly and saw good results.                 Q. For the first time since you made your KBO debut with the Lions, you’re on track to fulfill the regulated innings. How do you feel about that?          A. My goal is to fulfill the regulated innings. It’ll be hard but I really want to achieve it. If I can get through the rotation without an injury, then I want to exceed the number of innings. I want to achieve this more than I want to pick up 10 wins. It can be a motivation for me to go one step further.             BY BAE JUNG-HUNE, KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
233,Scholars discuss global crises at Kyung Hee University conference,"

     Kyung Hee University System hosts the annual Peace BAR Festival virtually on Tuesday to mark the International Day of Peace. Choue In-won, chancellor of the Kyung Hee University System, right, and Ahn Byong-jin, professor of the university's Global Academy for Future Civilizations, join the forum on campus while Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University, and John Ikenberry, professor of international relations at Princeton University, join in virtually. [KYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM]         Scholars from around the world called for a paradigm shift in thinking about solutions to the Covid-19 pandemic and climate crises at Kyung Hee University’s Peace BAR Festival in Seoul on Tuesday.           “The health crisis has in some ways acted as a wake-up call for [the] multilateral order,” Irina Bokova, the former director-general of Unesco and the Miwon Scholar of Practice at the university, said as she joined the conference virtually. “The Covid-19 pandemic [has shown that there is] a strong link between infectious diseases and climate hazards [...] It still remains to be seen whether climate change will fight its way onto the agenda for a period or become sacrificed again.”           Due to the pandemic, scholars gathered virtually at the annual forum, hosted by the Kyung Hee University System and organized by the university’s Global Academy for Future Civilizations, in recognition of the Sept. 21 International Day of Peace.             The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations after Kyung Hee University proposed its founding that year during a conference of the International Association of University Presidents (IAUP).            The forum on Tuesday was themed “The Era of Urgency, a New Horizon for Political Norms,” focusing on the pandemic and climate crises among other global issues calling for immediate attention.           Speakers at the forum made a point of questioning values and ideals that a majority of the word has accepted as universal.             “The 200 years of competitive capitalism have lessened hunger and disease but they have not eliminated them. But they brought us new problems, including the Covid-19 and climate change [crises],” said Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University. “For too long we have been told that there is no alternative [...] as capitalism that dominated half a century has filled the needs of many but left many [behind]. The urgent question is never what is the alternative, [but] how do you come to believe that a given alternative can be achieved.”           Evidence that the planet can no longer withstand the detrimental effects of greenhouse gas emissions and intensive industrial practices around the world can be found around the globe, said Oreskes, mentioning the more frequent landfall of deadly hurricanes in the United States, extreme heat waves in India, floods in Pakistan and wildfires in Australia.             “There are moments when we stop, catch our breath, and this is such a moment,” she said.             Despite the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change being felt in most corners of the world, a lack of globally coordinated efforts is concerning from the perspective of someone who has studied liberal democratic systems for decades, said John Ikenberry, professor of international relations at Princeton University.           “It is a very somber year and worrisome year to be talking about global cooperation,” said Ikenberry, also joining the forum virtually. “We haven’t found a way to replace the old American-centered governance system, which did generate huge amounts of cooperation.”           Failure to act now will have repercussions across generations, he said.             “I would emphasize that there are multiple layers in the global crises [one of which] is the crisis of liberal democracy,” he said. “Failure of liberal democracy is not just a failure of American or French politics. It’s a failure of several hundreds of years of models of open society and representative government in the sense that reason, civic discourse [...] and limited government can generate solutions to the problems.”           But neither scholar was too pessimistic about the ability for mankind to turn things around.           “The closest thing I’ve seen to today’s crisis was the 1930s and early ‘40s,” Ikenberry said. “The good news there is that they did find solutions. The Holocaust, the Great Depression [...] all these things generated creativity, new thinking, new deals [...] new coalitions.”             Oreskes added, “We will get to the other side. But what that transition looks like is potentially very ugly — that is what we want people to understand.”           Choue In-won, the Kyung Hee University System chancellor, emphasized that mankind at this moment is more equipped with knowledge and technological advancements than any of its previous generations.           “We are at the face of not just one crisis but multiple ones,” he said. “But we have also with us knowledge that has been accrued over the ages [...] Now is the time to talk about what kinds of discussions we want to have on multilateral and international settings to realize a future we all want despite the difficult road ahead.”           BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         "
234,"Green New Deal to add 2,000 start-ups under a new plan","

     Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Sung Yun-mo, third from right, watches a solar energy monitor at Soul Energy, a solar energy consulting firm, in central Seoul on Tuesday. [YONHAP]               The number of energy-related start-ups will be increased to 4,000 under a government plan that will focus on six sectors.             On Tuesday, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy laid out a support strategy on innovative energy companies as part of the Moon Jae-in government's Green New Deal.             Solar energy operating and management, virtual power plants, wind power supporting services, electric vehicle (EV) battery-related services, renewable energy-related materials, parts and equipment and building energy-efficiency management are the six areas of focus.             The research and development (R&D) will be focused on operating and management platforms as well a data system that will monitor deficient solar panels in real-time.             The government plans to implement a system that will control the output of virtual power plants, a cloud-based network of decentralized power generators. A virtual power plant is a key technology used in renewable energy power generators, whether it be solar or wind.             The government plans to allocate 40 billion won ($34.4 million) on virtual power plants by 2025, up from 8.7 billion won this year.             On wind power, the government plans to increase the participation of innovative energy companies in major wind farms.           Additionally, it said it will increase the R&D budget on developing an operating and management platform as well as a smart-turbine control system from 30 billion won this year to 50 billion won by 2025.           The government said by 2022 it will invest 6.9 billion won in creating an EV battery-testing site on Jeju Island. It will also create a platform that will collect and analyze data on EV batteries conducted by the state-financed Korea Electronics Technology Institute.           The total budget will be 20 billion won in 2025, from 9.5 billion won this year.           The government also plans to spend 45 billion won by 2025, up from 22.5 billion won, on R&D in materials, parts and equipment related to renewable energy, including smart inverters for solar panels and floating devices for wind power smart sensors.             For building energy efficiency, the government plans to invest 45 billion won, up from 22.5 billion won this year, which will include creating a standard for building energy management systems (BEMS) and smart sensors.           In addition to the development, the government will also provide financial and marketing support for the energy-innovative start-ups.           As of last year, the number of energy-innovative companies was 2,029, whose total revenue as of 2018 amounted to 9.69 billion won.             The annual average revenue increase is 9.4 percent, with an operating profit ratio of 4.6 percent.             The government estimated that when the number of such companies increases to 4,000 by 2025, the number of people employed will increase from 35,000 as of last year to 95,000.             “Innovative companies in energy equipped with new technologies and ideas will bring about innovation in the energy industry in a time of paradigm shift represented through decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization,” said Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Sung Yun-mo.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

     President Moon Jae-in gives a videoconference speech for a high-level meeting of the United Nations on Monday. Moon gave the address as the chair of the Mikta, a group of five middle powers.  [YONHAP]                In a videoconference meeting with international leaders, President Moon Jae-in promoted Korea's decision to trust its people's willingness to respect social distancing, instead of enacting mandatory lockdowns, to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.            Moon gave a virtual speech at a high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, hosted in New York on Monday. He gave the speech as the chair of a group representing five middle powers known by the acronym Mikta, which also includes Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Australia.             In his address, he stressed the importance of global cooperation, based on multilateralism and humanitarianism, in the fight against the Covid-19 crisis.             ""The spread of Covid-19 was an extraordinarily difficult challenge for Korea as well,"" Moon said. ""However, in a time of crisis, the Korean people chose the path that leads to freedom for all.           ""The Korean government kept our people fully informed every step of the way, and in return, the people voluntarily put on face masks and actively practiced social distancing, based on the belief that I can be safe only when my neighbors are safe,"" Moon continued. ""Moreover, we extended the scope of 'neighbors' beyond our borders. By sharing infectious disease prevention equipment with other countries without closing borders and shutting down certain regions, we were able to keep our country and economy intact.""             ""Korea's story is a tale of how, in the face of crisis, the people put into practice the universal values of humankind that the UN has championed — from freedom and democracy to multilateralism and humanitarianism,"" Moon continued.             ""Solidarity and cooperation is a power unique to humans that a virus can never match,"" he said. ""At the same time, it is the most potent weapon at our disposal that can defeat the coronavirus.""             Moon proposed guaranteeing equitable access to vaccines and therapeutics, and said multilateralism in the international order must be restored. He also urged the world to pursue a path of ""green recovery,"" arguing that more countries must join the ""Global Green New Deal Solidarity,"" which seeks to address the climate crisis while creating jobs and enhancing inclusiveness.           Moon also promoted the efforts of Mikta countries to support the United Nations. He said the middle powers' cross-regional and innovative partnership will serve as a bridge between advanced nations and developing countries.           According to the Blue House, it was the first time that a chair of the Mikta gave an address in a UN event. During the 12-hour event on Monday, leaders from 180 countries gave video addresses.           Moon is scheduled to deliver another address at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, which will be early Wednesday in Seoul time.             In the pre-recorded video address, Moon will seek the international community's support for the Korean government's initiative for peace on the Korean Peninsula and the region, the Blue House said last week.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]      "

238,High school left-hander leads KBO amateur draft,"

     Kim Jin-wook of Gangneung High School throws a pitch against Gimhae HIgh School in the final game of the Golden Lion National High School Baseball Tournament at Mokdong Baseball Stadium in western Seoul on June 22. [YONHAP]               A high school left-hander was selected first overall in the annual Korean baseball draft on Monday.           The Lotte Giants of the KBO chose Kim Jin-wook, senior at Gangneung High School, with the first pick of the annual amateur draft.           In line with social distancing measures in place during the coronavirus pandemic, the draft was held in a virtual format, with the room set up inside a Seoul hotel connected online with the front offices of 10 KBO clubs.           Kim pitched his school to the President's Cup National High School Baseball Tournament title last month, giving Gangneung its first national championship. Kim was named both the MVP and the Best Pitcher at the tournament.           In June, Kim led Gangneung to the final at another major national competition, the Golden Lion National High School Baseball Tournament, but the team finished runner-up to Gimhae High School. Kim threw 7 1/3 innings and struck out 11 in relief.           In 2020, Kim has pitched to a 1.70 ERA and a 4-1 record in 10 appearances covering 36 2/3 innings. He has struck out 55 and walked eight.           Last year, in his second year of high school, Kim went 11-1 with a 1.58 ERA in 21 appearances, with 132 strikeouts and 18 walks in 91 innings.            He won the annual Choi Dong-won Award, given to the country's best pitchers in amateur and pro ranks, in the high school category.           Kim Pung-cheol, the Giants' head of scouting, said Kim Jin-wook is as complete a pitcher as they could find, and that he could be a valuable piece either in the starting rotation or in the bullpen.           ""He may not blow you away with his fastball velocity, but it's an area he can improve with systematic training,"" the scout added.           The draft was held in the reverse order of the 2019 regular season records.           With the No. 2 pick, the Hanwha Eagles selected Yushin High School left-hander Kim Gi-jung. The Samsung Lions also chose a pitcher with the third overall pick, Lee Jae-hee, a Daejeon High School right-hander.           The Kia Tigers drafted Korea University right-hander Park Geon-woo with the fourth pick. The KT Wiz rounded out the top five with another collegiate player, Wonkwang University infielder Kwon Dong-jin.           The next five players were all high school players: Yushin High School infielder Kim Joo-won (NC Dinos), Sekwang High School infielder Lee Young-bin (LG Twins), Gwangju Jeil High School catcher Cho Hyoung-woo (SK Wyverns), Shinil High School infielder Kim Hwi-jib (Kiwoom Heroes) and Sunrin Internet High School right-hander Kim Dong-joo (Doosan Bears).           The Giants had the 11th overall pick, and they chose Duksoo High School infielder Na Seung-yeop.           Na, regarded as the top infield prospect in this year's class, announced last month he was going to sign with a major league club, reportedly the Minnesota Twins. But with no deal in place yet, the Giants went ahead and drafted him.           Monday's draft followed the territorial draft from August. Back then, teams could each select one amateur from their areas, though the bottom three clubs from the 2019 season were allowed to select out-of-town talent. The Giants, based in Busan, had their eyes on Na, whose school is in Seoul, for that draft. They chose another player instead and waited until the second round on Monday to select Na, who may not even sign with the Giants.           Na's father, Na Hee-cheol, thanked the Giants for selecting his son but said Seung-yeop still wants to play in the United States.           ""We've already made a verbal commitment with a major league club,"" the senior Na said. ""I'll talk with him about his future again since he was drafted by Lotte, but his desire to play in America hasn't wavered.""           The Giants said they knew of the risks of drafting Na, but added, ""Considering his talent, we felt it was well worth selecting him in the second round even if we end up losing that pick.""           Yonhap         "

The second part began on Aug. 14 and was aired live through Mnet and Big Hit Entertainment's official YouTube channel. Some 650,000 people tuned in from around the world, in part to see BTS cheer the trainees on.           The final episode aired on Sept. 18 and saw a final competition round with nine trainees. Seven made it to the group: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Niki, Jungwon and Sunoo.           Contrary to Mnet’s past audition shows, which mainly focused on each trainee’s musical talents, “I-LAND” focused on their background stories — commonly referred to as universe, like the Marvel universe — to show the boys’ journey toward their debut. Rather than just testing their dance and vocal skills, “I-LAND” tested their skills as human beings; meaning they were tested on their teamwork, decision-making and communication skills. “I-LAND” offered a space for the hopefuls to hatch into musicians.           From the very first episode, trainees were required to vote each other out of “I-LAND.” Some viewers said the process was “too cruel,"" but the producers of the program explained in a press conference held prior to the first episode that it was a way to prepare the potential members for a group dispute that will inevitably come in the future.              Member of Enhypen embrace each other in the last episode of ""I-LAND."" [BELIFT LAB]               Although the TV program itself did not score as high as expected compared to the other K-pop idol audition programs launched by Mnet in the past, the hype for Enhypen is much higher now that the debut members have been finalized.           Videos of the first 11 episodes of “I-LAND” posted on various platforms including YouTube have accumulated 34 million views, and after the final episode was uploaded, the viewership count amounted to 186 million views as of Sept. 19. The group’s Twitter account garnered over 710,000 followers just two days after being activated. On Saturday, Enhypen launched its first social media account, posting a trailer video of the members for the first time.           “We were able to debut as Enhypen thanks to all the love we received from everyone,” the members said in the video. “We promise to become the Enhypen that can bring joy to everyone who cheered us on.”           Enhypen will make its debut within this year, although no date has been set yet. But seeing that it took Wanna One, the resulting band from the second season of Mnet’s “Produce” audition series, two months to debut in August 2017 after the program wrapped up and took girl group I.O.I a month after its appearance on the same program, it’s expected to take a similar amount of time before Enhypen officially kicks off its schedules as a band.           Enhypen will be the first band to debut under Belift Lab, with more expected to come in the future.           BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
240,Mother of siblings who caused a fire cooking ramyeon faces neglect allegations,"

     The walls of the kitchen are charred after a pair of young brothers set their house on fire trying to cook ramyeon at their home in Yonghyeon-dong in Michuhol District, Incheon, on Sept. 14. Their mother had been away since the previous day, and the boys, severely burned, remain unconscious a week later. [NEWS1]               A pair of young siblings from Incheon set their house on fire after trying to cook themselves a bowl of ramyeon, or instant noodles, and both remain unconscious in the hospital over a week later.             The Sept. 14 incident has captured national attention as a cautionary tale.             The boys, aged eight and 10, had been left home alone by their mother since the previous day. The family lived on the second floor of a four-story villa in Yonghyeon-dong in the city's Michuhol District.             As their house burned down, the boys called emergency responders to report the blaze, but were unconscious by the time they were discovered by firefighters. The older brother sustained third-degree burns on about 40 percent of his body, including his back. The younger boy received first-degree burns, and both inhaled large amounts of smoke.           The siblings are currently on ventilators and receiving treatment in an intensive care unit in a Seoul hospital that specializes in burn victims.             Even if they do gain consciousness, they are expected to remain hospitalized for an extended period of time.             The children had been unable to go to elementary school in recent weeks because of the coronavirus and had been taking remote lessons from home. Their mother had previously been accused of neglecting them.             Neighbors had reported the family to child protection services three times between September 2018 and this May, alleging that the mother had neglected and abused her children.           After the first report, the Incheon Child Protection Agency told the mother that she needed to improve the home environment, and the mother received counseling from local family experts. Following the third report of negligence on May 12, child protection authorities turned the case over to police.             Incheon police booked the woman without detention for violating child welfare laws and referred the case to prosecution. Prosecutors in turn referred the child protection case to the Incheon Family Court, calling for the separation of the mother from her children.             The mother allegedly hit the 10-year-old child, and was also accused of having raised the kids in an unhygienic environment.             However, the children told authorities that they did not want to be separated from their mother.           In turn, the Incheon Family Court on Aug. 27 ruled against separating them, but said that the mother needed to receive counseling once a week for six months. Her children were also required to undergo counseling for a 12-month period.           However, counseling couldn’t start right away amid the heightened Covid-19 social distancing measures.             The woman, a single mother raising two children on her own, was a recipient of government basic livelihood subsidies, receiving a stipend of around 1.6 million won ($1,373) monthly. They lived in public rental housing provided by the Incheon city government for low-income families.             Police said that the mother made paper bags and wrapped gifts to earn a modest hourly wage until Aug. 25, when those types of local self-support work projects were halted because of Covid-19 social distancing measures. In June, she earned some 670,000 won through such labor and 700,000 won in July.             Asked where she had been since the day before the fire, the mother told police Thursday that she had been “meeting with an acquaintance.”             CCTV footage from convenience stores showed that the two boys often stopped by without a guardian to buy snacks, and neighbors likewise have said that the siblings were often spotted without their mother.             The Incheon Fire Department said Monday that the initial emergency call was received at 11:16 a.m. on Sept. 14. Because they were children, they were only able to cry out, “Help!” without being able to provide their exact address.            Later, the older boy stated the villa’s name, saying there was a fire and urging, “Hurry,” multiple times, according to a recording of the phone call.             But there are 66 residences, apartments and buildings in Michuhol with the same name, including at least four residences with a similar name in their neighborhood alone.             If a smartphone user allows location tracking, firefighters have an easier time locating the address, but that was not the case this time. Michuhol firefighters were able to trace the approximate location of the boys by tracking the base station where the smartphone was used.           It was only after neighbors spotted the fire around 11:18 a.m. and reported it to authorities that they were finally able to track down the exact house. As the closest fire station turned out to be less than 200 meters (656 feet) away, firefighters arrived at the scene of the fire at 11:21 a.m.           As of Sunday, Michuhol District Office said that there has been an outpouring of people reaching out to try to help the two siblings, and that the Haksannanum Foundation has so far gathered some 30 million won in donations from over 140 people.           President Moon Jae-in addressed the Incheon siblings’ plight in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, said the Blue House spokesman, and ordered aides to “review measures in the case of abused or neglected children to ensure their protection regardless of what the parents say.”             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "
241,Tesla to increase battery cell purchases from suppliers including LG  ,"

      Screen capture of Elon Musk's tweet on Tuesday. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk said the electric vehicle (EV) maker plans to increase battery cell purchases from current suppliers including LG Chem in a tweet on Tuesday.               The remark comes a day ahead of the “Tesla Battery Day” where the company is expected to unveil its own technology and major plans for the core component and the impact it will have on Tesla’s EV production.             “We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG & CATL (possibly other partners too),” he wrote in the tweet.               Tesla currently relies on external suppliers for rechargeable batteries, but there have been rumors that the company is preparing to internally produce batteries of its own. This is one of the announcements anticipated by industry watchers at Tesla’s first-time event dedicated to batteries.             The direction was vaguely confirmed in another tweet in which Musk said the company foresees “significant shortages in 2022 & beyond unless we also take action ourselves.”               But the major announcement, which will affect “long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck & Roadster, […] will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022,” Musk added.               The Tesla founder’s mention pushed LG Chem shares to rise 4 percent on Tuesday morning from the previous session. It closed 1.91 percent up at 639,000 won ($550). LG Chem was selected as one of the battery suppliers for the Tesla Model 3 last year.               BY SONG KYOUNG-SON  [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Residents of Sangbang Village in Buryang-myeon, Gimje, North Jeolla, wave for the camera Wednesday as they record videos to send their children for the upcoming Chuseok holidays. Several local government offices across the nation are launching special Chuseok programs to virtually connect residents with their children residing in other areas - and encourage them not to meet in person over Chuseok.

244,Banks follow the money to church and hope for data,"

                           KB Kookmin Bank offers a service that allows users to send donations to their churches using a mobile app. [KB KOOKMIN BANK]                A churchgoer has been attending online services for three consecutive weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic. Recently, she was informed of a new initiative at her church: online banking services for church donations.             “Transferring offerings online allows me to make different kinds of donations, which is very convenient,” she said.             Transferring contributions online has become common at churches these days, since religious group gatherings have been discouraged throughout the pandemic. Some people have complained about the online transferal method, saying it is inconvenient, as each type of donation must be sent to its own account. Churches also need to manage the accounts.           In this, banks have spotted a ""blue ocean"", an untapped market ready to be exploited.           KB Kookmin Bank on Sept. 2 rolled out a mobile app called the “digital gift basket,” receiving applications from 17 churches within two weeks. The service allows people to send money via the mobile app and also to select the design of the digital envelopes that go with the contribution. Users can write in their own prayer titles attached to the donation. Churches interested in this service can register at a KB Kookmin branch.             Hana Bank rolled out its own religious gift donation service, Hana 1Q Mobile Gift. It does not involve downloading an app. The service is accessible through various platforms: a text message, the church’s homepage and a QR code and utilizes open banking. Church members can use the service without creating a new account online.           Woori Bank is in the process of releasing a service that facilitates church donations.             The several hundred billion won in annual church donations is driving the interest in providing the services to the banks. Donations occur weekly, which means a guaranteed volume of transactions. Banks can promote their mobile gift services and partner with large churches to attract a large number of members as their customers.             Banks are not only interested in the cash flow from churchgoers but also the data on their donations. They are wondering whether religious donations will be included in the MyData program, a state-backed initiative that allows financial institutions to access a broad range of customers' information.           The financial authorities are set to select operators of the program in early 2021. The new services could unlock the financial information of churches and religious groups that has not been easily available and create a new market targeting more than 10,000 houses of worship.

[YONHAP]               Investors are bullish on Hyundai Motor and its affiliates, betting that the group's sales will recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.           Hyundai Motor shares closed at 185,000 won ($159) Monday, up 2.21 percent from the previous trading day. That's a whopping 180 percent increase over March when the shares hit a low for the year of 65,900 won due to coronavirus jitters. It is 56 percent higher than in January, when the market had yet to be rattled by the coronavirus.                            Hyundai Motor's market capitalization is now 39.5 trillion won, putting it  after Samsung Electronics, SK hynix, Samsung Biologics, Naver and LG Chem on the country's main bourse.           It recovered its sixth rank after being pushed to No. 11 in May when internet companies including Kakao and Naver were hot and manufacturing companies not.           Investors are equally keen on 11 other publicly traded affiliates of the group including the smaller carmaker Kia Motors and parts maker Hyundai Mobis.           Kia Motors' shares closed at 48,450 won climbing by 1.36 percent on Monday compared to the previous trading day. That is also a more than 125 percent increase from March. Hyundai Mobis’ shares jumped 1.04 percent Monday compared to the previous trading day, closing at 242,500 — 125 percent higher than in March.           The combined market capitalization of Hyundai Motor and its 11 affiliates surpassed 100 trillion won, according to the Korea Exchange Monday, for the first time in 28 months. Its market cap was 100.2 trillion won Monday, a 121.5 percent increase compared to March.           “Stable domestic sales and a recovery in earnings after Covid-19 have lead to a bullish stock price of Hyundai Motor,” said Kwon Soon-woo, an auto analyst at SK Securities.           “New momentum in its hydrogen-powered vehicles also factored in.”           Hyundai Motor posted a 52 percent year-on-year drop in operating profit in the second quarter of this year, but SK Securities expects it to post a whopping 187 percent year-on-year jump in the third quarter backed by new car launches and cost controls.           Hyundai Motor is launching a number of models soon, including a fully revamped Tucson SUV and a brand new GV70 SUV from its premium Genesis brand.           Hyundai Motor’s progress in hydrogen-powered cars also helped the surging stock price.           In its latest conference call with analysts, Hyundai Motor said it will sell hydrogen trucks in the United States within the next two years. It also said it would expand the production of hydrogen-fueled vehicles to 40,000 units next year from the current 11,000 units. That figure will expand to 500,000 units by 2030, the carmaker said.           Brokerage houses are raising their target prices for the auto company's stock.           SK Securities increased the price from 120,000 won to 210,000 won per share.

     The main page of an online shopping mall that was opened Monday by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, which allows small-business owners to sell their goods to public institutes. [SEOUL METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT]         The Seoul Metropolitan Government opened an online shopping mall Monday where small businesses can sell products to public institutes in the capital, as part of efforts to help struggling entrepreneurs amid the coronavirus pandemic.           Through the initiative, the Seoul government office said it hopes to boost transactions between both sides nearly five-fold annually, from the current 200 billion won ($172 million) to 1 trillion won.           The online platform, dubbed the “Seoul small-business owners public market” (seoul.s2b.kr), will allow Seoul’s 25 district offices, welfare centers, schools and other public institutes to easily look for items on the website rather than scouring the internet for a provider every time they need to buy something, the city said.           The Seoul government said an advanced search engine on the website also allows potential buyers to browse for products, compare them with other small businesses and also look for companies that are located in a particular district or hire workers with disabilities.           The Seoul government said it’s the first time that a local government office has opened an online shopping mall directly linking small-business owners and public institutes, and that any small-business owner in Seoul can promote their products on the website as long as they provide documents certified by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups proving they’re a small-business owner.           According to the Seoul city government, public institutes in Seoul purchase about 9 trillion won worth of goods in a year, including office supplies, stationery, computers and other equipment. Of that, about 200 billion won is spent on small businesses.           Seo Seong-man, an official overseeing labor and livelihood security policy at the Seoul Metropolitan Government, said the city looks forward to reviving the local economy with the new website.             The city “hopes [the online platform] helps small-business owners who are in distress due to the Covid-19 [pandemic] find new routes to sell their goods to public institutes,” Seo said in a statement. The city “also wishes [the website] will increase transparency in public institutes’ budget” spending, the official continued.           A call center will be set up to handle inquiries regarding the website, while a separate team of 50 consultants will help small-business owners get involved and sell their products on the platform, the city continued.           Apart from the online shopping mall, the city said it would also slash monthly rent by half from September through December for some 10,183 stores doing business in shopping areas owned by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, such as underground shops beside subway stations. All together, nearly 29.4 billion won will be exempted.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Hyundai Engineering & Construction won a contract for Philippines' North-South Commuter Railway project, which connects Malolos and Clark. [HYUNDAI ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION]               Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C) won a contract for the construction of the No. 1 section for the North-South Commuter Railway project in the Philippines.           The Department of Transportation made the award on Sept. 18 for the 670-billion-won ($578.6-million) project. Hyundai E&C is the project supervisor, and it is responsible for 57.5 percent, or 383.8 billion won, of the construction.           Before winning the contract, Hyundai E&C formed a partnership with Quezon City-based Megawide and and Korea's Dong-Ah Geological.           The No. 1 section is part of the North-South Commuter Railway, which extends 52 kilometers (32 miles) from Malalos, north of capital Manila, to Clark. The project has five sections total. The section that Hyundai E&C is building covers two ground-level stations and a 17-kilometer elevated bridge. Completion is expected to take 48 months.           Hyundai E&C has been active in the Philippines since 1986, when it won an Asian Development Bank order.             Through North-South Commuter Rail project, the government of the Philippines aims to improve accessibility in the country by shortening the travel time between Manila and Clark. It also hopes to solve the traffic congestion issue in the capital region and decrease travel expenses as well as carbon dioxide emissions.             The opening of the railway is expected to help the local tourism industry by creating jobs in system operation.           “This order was won during dire economic conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic, and Hyundai E&C will use its expertise in railway construction to build a high-quality infrastructure in the Philippines,” said a spokesperson for Hyundai E&C. “Going forward, Hyundai will continue to strengthen its competitive edge in construction and cultivate new growth engines.”             BY LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
250,PPP lawmaker in hot seat over family business,"

     Rep. Park Duk-hyum of the People Power Party holds a press conference to deny allegations that his family businesses were awarded government construction contracts while he was serving on the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee. [YONHAP]                A construction mogul-turned-lawmaker for the main opposition party said there was no conflict of interest between his family business and his serving on the National Assembly’s committee overseeing the Land Ministry.           Rep. Park Duk-hyum of the People Power Party (PPP) held a press conference Monday to deny suspicions raised by the ruling Democratic Party (DP) that construction companies owned by him and his family won massive national and local government projects because he served on the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee of the National Assembly. The committee has oversight over the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry and affiliated institutions.           “While serving as a lawmaker, I have never pressured or sought favors from the ministry or public institutions to win contracts,” Park, a three-term lawmaker representing Boeun, Okcheon, Yeongdong and Goesan counties in North Chungcheong, said Monday.             Park, who won his first election in 2012, served as a member of the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee of the National Assembly from April 2015 until this month. After suspicions arose about possible conflicts of interest with his family businesses, Park stepped down from the committee and started serving on the Environment and Labor Committee.           Last month, MBC aired a report saying that a construction company owned by Park’s family won 14 construction projects worth 40 billion won ($34.4 million) from the Land Ministry and the Seoul Metropolitan Government. It raised the suspicion that Park abused his power as a lawmaker on the committee to win the projects.           Following the report, DP lawmakers demanded Park resign from the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee. Park insisted he had done no wrong but agreed to leave the committee on Aug. 25. “I have worked in the construction business for my entire life, and I served the committee as an expert in the industry with pride,” he said at the time.           Last Tuesday, a civic group filed a complaint with the police asking it to investigate Park for abusing his power and committing violations of the Anti-Corruption Act and Public Service Ethics Act.           Rep. Jin Sung-joon of the DP described more suspicions last Wednesday. He said companies owned by Park’s family scored over 100 billion won in revenues by winning construction and technology contracts from the Land Ministry and public institutions supervised by the ministry over the last five years.             According to Jin, the ministry and affiliated institutions awarded 25 projects to three construction companies owned by Park’s family. The projects were worth 77.31 billion won in total.           The ministry and its institutions paid another 37.1 billion to two companies owned by Park’s family over the past five years for using their technologies, Jin said.           Although Jin said there was a conflict of interest, the companies have a history of winning bids by the ministry and receiving technology usage payments when Park was not serving on the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee. Records showed that the companies had won projects from the ministry since 2010.           Park was a renowned entrepreneur before he became a politician. The construction companies were founded by Park decades ago, and he served as chairman of the Korea Specialty Construction Association from 2006 till 2012. He handed over the construction businesses to his son and elder brother after winning his first election in 2012, but still owns major stakes in the companies.             “He served on the Land Committee since 2015. He was the opposition party’s chief negotiator on the committee since 2018 until early this year,” Jin said Wednesday. “There are serious suspicions that he violated laws.”           In his press conference Monday, Park said Jin’s arguments are wrong. He showed data that the companies’ sales went down after he became a lawmaker.           Park also said the Land Ministry and the Seoul city government were longtime customers of the companies. “The contracts are nothing new,” he said. “I checked with the companies, and the payments were legitimately made after completing work.           “If the ruling party’s arguments are true, it means that the country’s contract bidding system is tainted,” Park said. “They are telling the people to distrust this government.”           He also said his family companies won projects from the Seoul Metropolitan Government when the late Park Won-son, a DP member, was the mayor. “The people know that Mayor Park would never give preferential treatment to or break laws for a lawmaker’s family business,” he said.           Park said the ruling party is making groundless accusations against him to distract the people’s attention from DP corruption scandals.           But the DP continued to attack him. “Park must give up his lawmaker seat, and the PPP must handle this matter reasonably,” said Rep. Choi In-ho, senior spokesman for the DP.             The PPP said it will launch a special investigation. “We will form a team with the people who have experience in investigating such matters such as former prosecutors and police officials as well as experts in the bidding system,” Rep. Choi Hyung-du, a spokesman for the PPP, said. “The team will include both PPP members and outsiders.”           Opinions are split among PPP lawmakers about Park’s fate.             “It is cruel to force him to give up his seat just because his family businesses were making deals,” a senior lawmaker told the JoongAng Ilbo.           A first-term lawmaker of the PPP disagreed. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s legal or not,” he said. “It is inappropriate that his family’s companies won more than 100 billion won from the government offices that he had an oversight over.”           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
251,[SPONSORED REPORTS] Kogas gets serious about LNG bunkering business,"

     Officials from Kogas and its five partner organizations signed the documents to create a new joint LNG bunkering venture on July 14. [KOGAS]         “As a part of our eco-friendly business expansion plan, Korea Gas Corporation (Kogas) will push forward to promote liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunkering with 37 years of experience in the natural gas industry,” said Chae Hee-bong, Kogas president, in a commemorative speech to mark the 37th anniversary of the launch of the corporation in August.LNG bunkering is the procedure of providing liquefied natural gas to a ship for its own use, rather than as cargo. In comparison to traditional fuel, LNG emits 100 percent less sulfur oxide and dust, 15 to 80 percent less nitrogen oxide, 20 percent less carbon dioxide and 99 percent less fine dust, making it the ideal green fuel.International pacts and restrictions are what prompted Kogas to venture into the LNG bunkering industry. International Maritime Organization’s IMO 2020 regulation mandates a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent in marine fuels globally, down from the previous 3.5 percent. North America and European restrictions will force it to be lower than 0.1 percent.Kogas, having already built the only four LNG specialized shipment facilities in Korea at its Tongyeong station, finished construction of the LNG carrier SM Jeju LNG 2. The SM Jeju LNG 2, which will shuttle between Tongyeong and Jeju station, is the first LNG bunkering vessel in Asia with ship-to-ship LNG bunkering facilities.Last July, Kogas partnered with the Busan Port Authority, Posco international, S-Oil, Hyundai Glovis and Daewoo Logistics on LNG bunkering. The five organizations signed the Agreement on Establishing an LNG Bunkering Joint Venture, agreeing to establish a joint venture that could lead the industry in storing, distributing and supplying natural gas.With assistance from the joint venture, Kogas aims to reach 1.36 million tons in LNG sales, 1 trillion won ($860 million) in total sales, while producing 8,315 fewer tons of sulfur oxides and 2,557 fewer tons of fine dust. To implement the plan, Kogas is also planning to acquire three bunkering ships and secure loading facilities at the Dangjin LNG production station.“Kogas’ preliminary investment into LNG bunkering will pave the way for this country’s bunkering industry. With our multi-pronged expansion in the green energy transition business, Kogas will lead Korea’s low-carbon, environmentally friendly energy market,” Chae added.By Ahn Tae-lahm [ahn.taelahm@joongang.co.kr]   "
252,SK Telecom launches genetic health care subscription service,"

     SK Telecom and Macrogen's Care8 DNA test kit. [SK TELECOM]         Mobile carrier SK Telecom and gene testing company Macrogen launched a monthly subscription service Monday for a DNA analyzing service with connected health care app.           With a 12-month subscription plan costing 8,250 won ($7.10) per month, the service collects the DNA of the user and offers analyzed results via the mobile app called “Care8 DNA.” The app offers health-related information based on gene analysis including personalized diet plans and exercises that can be done at home.   Care8 DNA is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) gene test, meaning it connects the consumer directly to a gene testing company rather than going through a medical institute.BIS Research forecast the global DTC gene test market will grow from 980 billion won in 2019 to 7.6 trillion won by 2028.The service will end up costing 99,000 won for the full year, cheaper than other gene analysis services launched in the domestic market, the companies said.Collected with a mouth swab sent to the user, this DNA test offers data on 29 categories, like skin aging, possibility of hair loss, resistance to nicotine and the body’s recovery speed after exercise. With the results, users can also receive one-on-one sessions with an actual nutritionist and clinical exercise physiologists that offer advice on which exercise the user should engage in considering their fitness levels.Care8 DNA is the outcome of a collaboration between SK Telecom, Macrogen and Invites Healthcare. The technology in gene testing and analysis was offered by Macrogen. Invites Healthcare, a joint venture SK set up with private equity Newlake Alliance, specializes in digital health care technology.Any user of SK Telecom’s telecommunication service over 19 years old can purchase the subscription service from the company’s official Tworld website, mobile app or brick-and-mortar stores.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]  "

255,Spud sundaes and ugly apples as retailers rush to help farmers,"

                  Retail companies are lending a helping hand to farmers struggling as the combination of the coronavirus and an unseasonable summer followed by a spate of typhoons caused both plummeting commercial sales and a sudden lack of produce ahead of the holiday season.           To help boost sales, retailers are promoting produce that is not normally in high demand, offering inventive recipes and promotions focused on less-popular items.              SPC group CEO Hwang Jae-bok and the Han Wang-ki, head of the Pyeongchang County Office, take a commemorative photo on Monday. [SPC GROUP]               Bakery chain Paris Baguette operator SPC Group announced Monday that it inked a memorandum of understanding with the Pyeongchang County Office in Gangwon to develop new products using Gangwon’s regional produce as ingredients.           The idea is to help potato farmers in the region struggling to stay afloat as school cafeterias — considered their major customers — closed due to social distancing measures.           SPC will use Pyeongchang potatoes to develop bakery products at Paris Baguette stores and a new ice cream flavor at its Baskin Robbins 31 chains.           Discount retailers have also rolled up their sleeves to help struggling farmers by purchasing produce damaged by the typhoons and offering it at discounted prices.              A customer examines a box of imperfect pears at an Emart store in Seongsu-dong, eastern Seoul, on Sept. 17. [EMART]               Discount chain Emart purchased 360 tons of imperfect apples and pears and made them available at a discounted price ahead of the Chuseok holidays. Imperfect produce is fruit or vegetables equal in quality but not as attractive as their more sellable counterparts.           Lotte Mart has been selling misshaped apples since Sept. 5. A bag of five to 12 “ugly” apples are sold at half the price of a normal bag of apples, at 6,980 won ($6).           “We decided to increase sales of ugly fruit as produce supplies plummeted to alarming levels due to the abnormal weather conditions that hit farms since early this year. We hope to help struggling farms as well as contribute to stabilizing prices for ordinary customers,” said Lee Myoung-geun, manager of fresh produce at Emart.           The wholesale price of popular fruit has increased compared to last year, according to data from the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation. Ten kilograms of red apples were sold at 91,540 won on Monday, close to a fourfold increase compared to the wholesale price last year.           Pear prices also increased as many farms were flooded during the typhoons last month. Fifteen kilograms of pears were traded at 63,175 won in the wholesale market on Monday, almost double the wholesale price in 2019.           E-commerce platforms are using their networks to directly connect farmers with customers. Kakao Commerce, a live commerce app from Kakao, partnered with Korea Post to sell regional produce through the postal service’s KakaoTalk channel through the end of October.             Produce harvested in the southwest of the country and Jeju Island is currently being sold on the platform. Produce from North Chungcheong is scheduled to be made available on Oct. 16.           “We plan to expand our partnership with regional governments so that we can help expand distribution channels for producers and provide an affordable shopping experience for customers,” said an official from Kakao Commerce.           BY KANG JAE-EUN  [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

Vpplement, the company’s other online fashion brand that was launched on Sept. 1, met a shortage of supplies in a day.             Competition is intensifying among the country’s fashion and cosmetics companies to launch their own online-only brands.             On Sept. 8, Samsung C&T’s fashion brand Beaker launched its online brand B_ (pronounced ""B underbar"") while Kolon Industries FnC last month debuted its new online brand Lucky Marché.             Handsome, a Korean fashion brand owned by Hyundai Department Store, also introduced its online-only brand Rareview in June. According to the company, Rareview’s clothes will be made with the same quality fabric used in products of Handsome’s other brands.           Cosmetics companies are also moving quickly to hop on the online-only bandwagon.                    Cosmetics products from Amorepacific’s online brand Enough Project, which is only available through e-commerce operator Coupang. [ENOUGH PROJECT]               Amorepacific launched a new cosmetic brand Enough Project in June that is available exclusively through e-commerce operator Coupang. A month earlier, the company also introduced a new raspberry color of Hera’s lip tint, which is only available as a gift through KakaoTalk.           Besides Coupang, Amorepacific has teamed up with other e-commerce sites, such as 11st and Naver, to strengthen its online presence and target online shoppers.             The companies' recent move has been largely prompted by Koreans' changing shopping habits — especially those of young people.           According to Handsome, its three online stores — handsome.com, H Fashion Mall and EQL — generated 124 billion won ($107 million) in revenue in the first half of this year, a 62 percent increase compared to same period a year earlier. Cosmetics giant Amorepacific’s sales of online inventory spiked 80 percent in the second quarter of the year compared to a year before.           “Young people, who particularly enjoy online shopping, even share links to fashion platforms' items that are up at discounted prices [to their acquaintances],” Seo Yong-gu, a professor teaching business at Sookmyung Women's University, said. “As polarization intensifies in people’s consumption and a growing number of people seek more cost-effective options, online-only brands are likely to grow further.”           The number of offline stores, on the other hand, has declined consistently.

258,Hangeoleum model compromise is achieved for minbak,"

     A photo of a property of Japan's Sekai Hotel, which remodels empty houses for rent. [BOOKING.COM]               An Airbnb knockoff is to be allowed under a program in which the government looks for compromises between established industries and disruptive models.           House and apartment-sharing services are illegal in Korea for locals under most circumstances.           The government established the “Hangeoleum model,” which translates to one ""step at a time,"" on June 4. Under it, the authorities mediate disputes between the newcomers and the old guard.           Three projects have been targeted: the sharing of city lodging, a monorail project in Hadong County, South Gyeongsang, and the renting of empty houses in farming and fishing villages.           Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki on Monday said an agreement between a new businesses and the existing lodging industry has been reached where both would benefit.           “More specifically, the new business has agreed on conditions that were restrictive compared to their business proposal while agreeing to work with the local residents, including the provision of funding that will be used for the local villages,” Hong said during a government meeting on innovative growth strategy.           According to the government, Dazayo has been approved to rent 50 houses that have been empty for 300 business days in a year. Part of the revenue earned from the renting of the houses will be used for local community development.           The business model of Dazayo, which was founded in 2015, is to remodel empty houses in the farming and fishing villages in exchange for a free 10-year lease. The remodeled houses are then rented to consumers, much like Airbnb.             Dazayo faced strong opposition from the local minbak (guest house) operators, who were threatened by the emergence of Dazayo.           As of 2019, 28,551 minbak were in the rural areas of Korea, a 3.3 percent increase year-on-year from 27,631.           Minbak businesses, which have become one of the key income sources for farming and fishing villages, have been increasing in number gradually. In 2010, there were only 18,858 units.           Dazayo was forced to stop in July last year for violating the regulations which require the operator of a minbak in a farming or fishing village to reside in the same building as the accommodation.           Finance Minister Hong added that the government has come up with measures that would improve safety as well as stepping up the competitiveness of minbak businesses in the rural areas.             “We have set aside 2.5 billion won in next year’s budget for safety education and consulting support” for minbak, Finance Minister Hong said.           “There has been a conflict between existing minbak businesses and new businesses as [the new business models] went against the agriculture and fishing village minbak regulations, which were supposed to increase the income of farmers and fishermen,” Hong said. “With each taking a step back, we were able to reach an agreement where both parties could benefit.”           As of 2019, 61,317 houses stood empty in the provincial areas, a significant surge from 38,988 units in 2018.           These houses, which have been vacant for at least 1 year, account for 1.5 percent of the 3.9 million housing units in the rural areas.           A total of 42,111 units are in such bad condition that they need to be demolished, while 19,206 units are in relatively good condition and can be reutilized.           The government also discussed fostering five green bio areas, including creating a road map for microbiome, alternative food and medical food, developing the seed industry, medicine for pets and biomaterials.             The government also said it has decided to create a supercomputing center and research data center for the agriculture bio sector.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

[AFP/YONHAP]               New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called Korea an ""important neighbor"" and expressed hopes of building ""forward-looking"" relations in a letter to President Moon Jae-in, the Blue House said Monday.           Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok said in a briefing that Suga sent a response on Saturday to Moon’s congratulatory letter after his election as Japan’s new prime minister succeeding Shinzo Abe.             Suga “expressed thanks for President Moon’s congratulatory letter and stressed that the two countries are important neighbors,” said Kang, and conveyed his “hopes to overcome difficult issues to build forward-looking bilateral relations.""           Moon in the letter to Suga expressed his wishes to work together to improve Korea-Japan relations and offered to sit for a summit anytime with the prime minister, describing Japan as “Korea's closest friend culturally and geographically, and a neighbor that shares fundamental values and strategic interests.”             Bilateral ties have been especially chill over the past year, after Japan implemented export restrictions on Korea in July 2019, resulting in an ongoing tit-for-tat trade spat. Japan’s export measures were seen as retaliation against two Korean Supreme Court rulings in late 2018 ordering Japanese companies to pay compensation to individual Korean victims of wartime forced labor.           Suga held his first phone call since taking office with U.S. President Donald Trump Sunday and discussed issues including cooperation on North Korea's missile and nuclear threats.             Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, announced his resignation last month because of health issues.           Days after his resignation, Abe on Saturday visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which enshrines 14 Class A war criminals from World War II, for the first time in six years and eight months.             Seoul’s Foreign Ministry immediately in a statement expressed ""deep concern and regret"" that Abe visited the shrine, “a symbolic establishment which glorifies Japan’s history of colonial rule and war of aggression, immediately after his resignation.”           The ministry added that the “international community can trust Japan only when Japanese leaders face history squarely and show by action they humbly reflect on and genuinely atone for the past history.”           Abe’s last visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo in December 2013 drew international backlash.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

They were allowed back to classrooms at the start of the semester in May.           The Ministry of Education announced on Sept. 15 — soon after the central government lifted the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for the Seoul metropolitan area — that schools in the region would reopen again on Monday for the first time in 26 days, albeit with restrictions.           Through Oct. 11, kindergartens, elementary and middle schools will be allowed to run up to a third of their capacities to guarantee social distancing, while high schools can run up to two-thirds.                              Schools outside the Seoul metropolitan area have been ordered to follow the same guidelines from Monday to Oct. 11, though some school districts can allow more students in classrooms after consultation with the Education Ministry.           A 17-year-old high school student in Yeongdeungpo District, western Seoul, said Monday he was glad to be back.           “I was wearing short sleeves the last time I came to school, but now I’m wearing long sleeves,” he said.           “The school year is about to end, but sadly I didn’t have a chance to bond with my classmates and teachers due to the pandemic.”           Kim Mi-yeoung, 37, who has a child in second grade, says she, too, was relieved schools reopened.            “I’m not entirely comfortable about the risk of my child getting infected at school, but I think there are certain things that children can only learn by physically going to school and mingling with other kids,” she said.           Whether schools will remain open after Oct. 11 will all come down to the upcoming Chuseok holidays, which start on Sept. 30.             Health authorities have already warned that the entire nation will go through yet another set of restrictions for two weeks from Sept. 28 in time for Chuseok, the specifics of which will be revealed Friday.           Yoon Tae-ho, an official at the Central Disaster Management Headquarters, said in a Monday press briefing that daily new cases of infection were definitely falling thanks to the public’s compliance with social distancing measures, but warned that untraceable infections remain above 20 percent of all new cases. That means epidemiologists aren’t sure how or where those people got infected, which raises the odds they might have unwittingly spread the virus to others.           Health authorities Monday also raised the possibility of Korea’s first case of reinfection, though further study was needed to confirm it. Officials said there were only five reported cases of reinfection globally.           Korea’s suspected reinfection patient was identified as a woman in her 20s who lives in Seoul and initially got infected last March. According to health officials, she was hospitalized and recovered later that month, and was discharged. But a week later, a cold came on, and she tested positive for the virus again.             How she got infected on both occasions was not revealed, but officials said it appears she was infected with two different strains of the coronavirus, among seven main strains that have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO).           Further study is underway.           Among 70 people in Korea who were diagnosed with the coronavirus Sunday, 55 were local infections: 21 in Seoul, 18 in Gyeonggi, eight in Busan, two each in Daejeon, North Chungcheong and South Gyeongsang, and one each in Incheon and North Gyeongsang.           Out of 15 imported cases, four were from the Philippines, three each from India and Turkey, and one each from Indonesia, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Japan and Australia.             Two people died Sunday, bringing total deaths to 385, while 90 people recovered, raising total recoveries to 20,248. As of Sunday at midnight, Korea had counted 23,045 coronavirus patients in all.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN, KIM JI-A   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
261,Stocks drop almost 1% as investors question valuations ,"

     A screen shows the closing stats for the Kospi in a trading room at Hana Bank in Jung District, central Seoul, Monday. [NEWS1]                The Kospi fell below the 2,400 mark on Monday, as lingering valuation pressure drove down the key index. The won rose against the dollar.           The benchmark Kospi lost 23.01 points, or 0.95 percent, to close at 2,389.39.           Trading volume was high at about one billion shares worth some 14 trillion won ($12.1 billion), with losers outnumbering gainers 694 to 168.           Foreigners sold a net 72 billion won, while retail investors purchased a net 46 billion won. Institutions bought a net 33 billion won.           The Kospi closed lower after a choppy session. Losses in bio and chemical heavyweights led the index's fall.           Valuation concerns weighed heavily on the local stock markets after the key stock index exceeded the psychologically important 2,400 level. The reading is widely seen as a sign of market confidence in the pandemic-hit economy.           Analysts predicted more days of choppy trading to come, citing an absence of market events to vent the valuation pressure.           ""With the earnings season far away and profit forecast left unchanged, the Kospi was doomed to fall,"" Choi Yoo-joon, a researcher at Shinhan Financial Investment, said.           Most large caps closed lower in Seoul.           Samsung Electronics edged down 0.17 percent to 59,200 won, while chipmaker SK hynix advanced 0.96 percent to 84,500 won.           Chemical maker LG Chem plunged 5.86 percent to 627,000 won, and rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI shed 1.55 percent to 446,000 won.           Amorepacific lost 1.19 percent to 166,500 won, and Korean Air gained 0.27 percent to 18,850 won.           Pharmaceutical firm Samsung Biologics fell 2.37 percent to 740,000 won, and Celltrion sank 4.46 percent to 278,500 won.           Naver retreated 2.01 percent to 292,000 won, with Kakao down 2.28 percent to 364,500 won.           NCSoft lost 2.07 percent to 804,000 won, while rival Netmarble rose 1.08 percent to 188,000 won.           The local currency closed at 1,158 won against the dollar, down 2.3 won from the previous session's close.           The Kosdaq dropped 21.89 points, or 2.46 percent, to close at 866.99.             Bond prices, which move inversely to yields, closed mixed. The yield on three-year bonds lost 0.4 basis points to 0.904 percent, and the return on 10-year bonds rose 0.8 basis points to 0.69 percent.           BY CHEA SARAH, YONHAP   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "
262,It's not too late for a bit of last-minute Chuseok shopping,"

     A delivery rider picks up Chuseok gifts from Lotte Department Store for delivery within three hours. [LOTTE SHOPPING]               The Chuseok harvest holiday may be only a week away, but tardy gift givers don't need to panic just yet as this year retailers are accepting orders right up until the very last minute.          Usually, stores stop accepting orders for Chuseok gifts three to six days before the actual holiday due to delivery issues. But because of the increased demand this year, they will be receiving online orders for gifts until Sept. 29, the day before the three-day holiday begins.          Lotte Department Store is offering rapid delivery services this year, delivering Chuseok gifts within three hours of orders being placed.           Customers need to spend at least 90,000 won ($78) to use the service, which is available from Lotte Department Store’s main branch in central Seoul, and gifts must be for delivery within Seoul. The three-hour delivery service will run from Sept. 25 through Sept. 29.           Hyundai Department Store is also accepting orders for Chuseok gifts until Sept. 30.           From its 10 branches, including its main branch in Apgujeong-dong in southern Seoul, Hyundai Department Store is providing next-day delivery services in some parts of the country, including Seoul and Gyeonggi.           Discount marts and e-commerce operators like SSG.com are extending orders to Sept. 30. The availability of the service from offline marts will depend on the distance between the store and the delivery destination.           Retailers this year are receiving Chuseok gift orders for longer than usual because of the increased demand due to Covid-19, which has interfered with many people’s plans to visit family.           According to Lotte Department Store, its sales of Chuseok gifts jumped 41 percent on year from Sept. 14 through Sept. 17. The amount spent on gifts has also increased by 46 percent during the same period.            SSG.com showed a similar trend. The average amount spent on Chuseok gift sets rose more than 15 percent on year from Aug. 13 through Sept. 19. The number of purchases of gifts that cost more than 200,000 won also jumped 194 percent.           People are spending more money on gifts to make up for not being able to visit their family due to the pandemic, according to Lotte Shopping, operator of the department store chain.           Costly and unique types of food, including truffles and muscat grapes, sold particularly well, according to Lotte.           “The last-minute delivery became possible on the improved delivery structure,” said a spokesperson for Lotte Shopping.             BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleDelivery workers threaten strike ahead of Chuseok holidayTraveling over Chuseok is a no-go in time of pandemicChoose wisely this Chuseok as vegetable prices soarChuseok 2020: Bigger discounts, more distancing "

264,Checkmate debuts with big ambitions to match its name,"

     Rookie co-ed pop group Checkmate performs its debut single ’Drum“ during an online debut showcase held on Monday afternoon. [GRACE COMPANY ENTERTAINMENT]         If the K-pop industry is a giant chess board, rookie co-ed group Checkmate is hoping to rise to the very top.           The five-member co-ed group made its official debut on Monday with the single “Drum,” aiming to one day dominate the K-pop scene and live up to their ambitious name.           Checkmate is composed of two female members and three male members: group leader and main female vocalist Sieun, female rapper Suri, male rapper Nason and main vocalists Yongseok and Noah.           The debut song ""Drum"" is a reggae house EDM track with an addictive melody that features a cheerful and rhythmical marching band performance that fits the repeated refrain: “Hit on me like I’m a drum.”           “When I first heard the song 'Drum,' all I could think was, ‘This song is perfect for our group,’"" leader Sieun said.           “Our first release is a reggae, EDM-based song, but we would love to release a track that is more soulful, or more of a hip-hop genre,” Yongseok added.           Prior to their debut, the checkmate members have individually captivated South American and European fans with various cover song videos on YouTube including Sunmi’s ""Lalalay"" (2019) cover by Sieun and BTS’ ""Fire"" (2016) cover by male members Nason and Noah.           Checkmate said its ultimate goal is to top Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, just like BTS.           ""As the leading K-pop groups are making incredible achievements in the global music scene, we want to have a big ambition that follows their paths. We aim to grow as a global K-pop group that not only dominates local music charts but global charts.           “We hope people will one day say ‘Checkmate has put the music scene into checkmate,’ after watching our performances. Just as our name implies, we hope that listeners won’t be able to escape from us after listening to our music,” Yongseok said.           ""We’ve worked so hard to come this far to make a debut, and there are still so many things we want to show everyone, so please look forward to our future activities and send us support,” Noah said.           “I'm sorry we had to hold our debut showcase online due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but we hope to communicate actively with our fans through YouTube videos and live broadcasts, so please look forward and subscribe to our YouTube channel,"" Yongseok said.           Sieun said that the best part of being a co-ed group is that they are capable of performing both feminine and masculine songs, giving a wider spectrum of music for their fans to listen to.           “We are going to perform as a group but also in units and solos, so please look forward to our future activities,” Yongseok said.           “I wish our group can be remembered as a group that people want to look forward to,” Sieun said.           BY KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "
265,Blue House event seen as public display of support for Choo,"

     President Moon Jae-in, left, and Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, right, enter a strategy meeting at the Blue House to reform the National Intelligence Service (NIS), prosecution and police on Monday.  [YONHAP]                President Moon Jae-in on Monday hosted a strategy meeting to reform the country's powerful law enforcement authorities, including the prosecution, and urged top members of his administration and the ruling party to complete the changes.             Moon hosted the strategy session on the reform of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), prosecution and police at the Blue House for the first time in more than a year and a half. Among the participants were Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, Interior and Safety Minister Chin Young and NIS Director Park Jie-won. Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl was not invited to the meeting.             Moon has promised to end the NIS’s decades-long practice of intervening in domestic politics, decentralize powers of the prosecution and hand some of the investigative authorities to the police. In his opening remarks, Moon urged the officials to put all their efforts toward completing the reforms. He also urged the government and the ruling Democratic Party (DP) to work together to pass relevant laws to ensure the planned changes will be systemized.             He also urged the administration and the ruling party to persuade opposition lawmakers to launch a new investigative agency for senior officials as soon as possible. The Corruption Investigation Office For High-Ranking Officials (CIO) was supposed to launch before July 15, but the opening was delayed as the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) refused to form a nomination committee for its head.             Speculation was high about the conspicuous timing of the event, as it was the first time since February 2019 that Moon decided to listen to the progress of reform from top officials. The meeting notably took place amid snowballing allegations that Justice Minister Choo’s son had received special treatment when he was serving the military in 2017.             The prosecution has been investigating those allegations for eight months, and is expected to announce the outcome as early as this week.             It appeared that Moon was displaying support for his justice minister on Monday, when he entered the event accompanied by Choo. Before the strategy session started at 2 p.m., most participants sat in their seats and waited for the president’s entry for about five minutes. Moon entered the room with Choo and Presidential Chief of Staff Noh Young-min.             Law community insiders, particularly prosecutors, said the timing of the meeting is too political.             “It seems that Moon wants to use the event to display his support for Choo,” a senior prosecutor told the JoongAng Ilbo. “The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office, which has to make a decision on whether it must indict Choo’s son or not, will feel pressure.”             “There is no special or urgent issue, but the Blue House abruptly called for this meeting,” added a senior official from the prosecution. “It made us wonder about the intention.”             The Blue House dismissed the speculation.           “Please don’t link the strategy session with what’s going on outside,” a senior presidential aide told the reporters. “See this as an event to secure the momentum to further push forward the reform.”             Since taking office in January, Choo has pushed forward strong reform measures, including a series of reshuffles of prosecutors to weaken their established hierarchy. Her moves faced resistance from the prosecutors and prompted hundreds of thousands of people to sign petitions to the president to dismiss her. The Blue House replied earlier this month that Moon supports Choo.             It was not the first time that a Blue House event faced criticism for its political overtones. In September last year, Moon made the rare decision to hold a cabinet meeting at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).             At the time, Choo’s predecessor, Justice Minister Cho Kuk, was facing a scandal related to his daughter’s alleged academic fraud. While Cho’s daughter was suspected of having used a fake internship certificate from the KIST for her graduate school admission, Moon hosted the cabinet meeting at the institute, fueling speculation that the president was trying to publicly convey his support for Cho.                   BY JUNG YOO-JIN, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "
266,GC Pharma starts Phase 2 trials of Covid-19 plasma treatment,"

     [GC PHARMA]         GC Pharma has started Phase 2 clinical trials for its Covid-19 treatment candidate, the company said Monday.            The first patient was injected with the plasma treatment GC5131A on Saturday at Chung-Ang University Hospital in southern Seoul. Plasma treatments are made from immune proteins extracted from blood plasma donated by people who have had the virus.   One of the two government partners to develop a coronavirus treatment, GC Pharma received a nod to undergo Phase 2 clinical trials on Aug. 20. It was permitted to skip Phase 1 clinical trials, as the safety of plasma treatment had been approved in other commercialized drugs.The Phase 2 trials will be conducted on 60 coronavirus patients that are showing symptoms of pneumonia or are in a vulnerable state such as old age or were battling other diseases before infection. It is aimed to verify the safety and efficacy and explore the right dosage to treat the respiratory illness. Six hospitals including Chung-Ang will take part.GC Pharma’s head of development Lee Jae-woo said in a conference early September that the aim is to complete injections of GC5131A for Phase 2 clinical trials within this year. A core variant that decides the progress of developing a plasma treatment is blood donations. It normally takes plasma donated by two to three recovered patients to develop a plasma treatment for a single patient.As of Sept. 5, more than 2,600 recovered patients had offered to donate blood. Forty-six centers run by the Korean Red Cross Blood Services nationwide will collect the donated blood.    The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance is also planning to launch Phase 3 clinical trials for a plasma treatment. GC Pharma is one of the 10 members of this alliance working together in a global initiative to find a plasma-based Covid-19 treatment. The alliance’s jointly-developed treatment candidate will conduct Phase 3 trials on 500 Covid-19 patients in the United States, Denmark, Argentina and Britain.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]  "
267,Leaked documents show how North used U.S. banks to evade sanctions: NBC News,"

     A screenshot of a U.S. Justice Department indictment from May of dozens of North Korean bankers accused of laundering money for the regime. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               North Korea laundered millions of dollars despite international sanctions through a convoluted scheme that involved prominent U.S. banks in New York, according to leaked secret bank documents, NBC News reported on Sunday.           The findings follow a massive leak of documents from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, also known as FinCEN, which were obtained by Buzzfeed News and subsequently became part of a collaborative project with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Buzzfeed News and over 400 journalists across the globe.           The documents revealed an elaborate series of suspicious activities flagged by banks that showed $174.8 million had been laundered for Pyongyang mainly throughout 2008 to 2017, when the regime was subject to a restrictive set of financial sanctions imposed by the United States as a result of its nuclear and missile programs, NBC News reported.             Key to the North Korean methods of penetrating global financial networks while evading sanctions was the role played by Chinese companies, the report said, underscoring the difficulty faced by U.S. compliance officials in detecting such schemes.             One prominent example highlighted in the report involved Chinese businesswoman Ma Xiaohong, who has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of using her Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Corp. to help Pyongyang launder its foreign earnings.             According to some of the bank documents, Ma and her company funneled money through various layers of shell companies in several countries, including China and Singapore, and through U.S. banks in New York.          A report filed by JPMorgan showed the bank was used in the transfer of some $89.2 million between 2011 to 2013, involving companies and individuals associated with North Korea.             Such moves testify to just how far-reaching the regime’s money-making operations have been, cleverly carried out under sanctions in what the NBC report termed ""a cat and mouse game"" with the United States.             In 2005, the United States famously sanctioned one of these operations through the Banco Delta Asia, singling the bank out among many others in Macau that handled North Korean money in order to set an example for other banks.             The move sparked a political dispute between Washington and Pyongyang that eventually allowed the latter to regain access to its funds at the bank after the issue was brought to the then-active Six Party Talks.             But the case effectively made Macau a less alluring destination for North Korean laundering schemes, after the city enforced stricter antilaundering guidelines in the wake of the incident.             Pyongyang has also been resorting to the cybersphere as a source to generate foreign currency for its leaders. In March, Washington indicted several Chinese citizens for allegedly helping the North launder some $100 million in stolen cryptocurrency, some of which was taken from a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange in 2018.             And the U.S. Department of Justice in May filed another indictment against 28 North Korean and five Chinese bankers accused of laundering and transferring some $2.5 billion to Pyongyang’s Foreign Trade Bank through covert branches in places like China, Russia, Thailand, Libya and Kuwait.           The transactions were believed to have taken place throughout much of the time sanctions were in place over the last decade, as late as January this year, according to the Justice Department.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]        "

269,'Voice of Silence' forces audience to redefine good and evil,"

     From left, actor Yoo Jae-myung, director Hong Eu-jung and actor Yoo Ah-in pose for the camera at an online press event on Monday to promote their upcoming film ""Voice of Silence."" [ACEMAKER MOVIEWORKS]                In their upcoming crime film “Voice of Silence,” lead actors Yoo Ah-in and Yoo Jae-myung promise it’s going to be unlike any other crime film, in the sense that their characters are not evil, but are more or less ordinary people doing their jobs like everyone else.             In the movie, both actors play subcontractors employed by hit men to clean up the bodies.           “On the outside, they’re the bad guys, criminals,” Yoo said at an online press event on Monday. “But Tae-in [played by Yoo Ah-in] is described as a silent, diligent person who completes the tasks that’s given before him — there’s no malice in his actions. [His personality and his job] in a way balance each other out, and it makes the viewers refrain from making a moralistic judgment of him. Through the character, it makes people question what is supposed to be a ‘good’ life, the distinction between the good and the evil that [we have] created and what stories lie beneath the surface of what the world judges to be evil and cruel.”           For this role, Yoo not only gained 15 kilograms (33 pounds), but also stars in his first role free of dialogue.           “Seeing that Tae-in can still make some form of sounds, I don’t think he’s completely speech-impaired,” Yoo said. “Due to some kind of hardship that he went through in his past, he’s someone who refuses to express himself to the world — he refuses to be and stay connected, and reveal himself. [To act without dialogue] was both comfortable and a challenge for me.”             “Chang-bok, on the other hand, is an excessive talker,” Yoo Jae-myung said, introducing his character. “He’s actually very nice — and thinks that he has been blessed to earn his livelihood and to have a roof over their heads. He just believes that ‘burying bodies’ is part of his job, and wants to do it as best as he could. He’s very religious and frugal.”           The story really begins as the duo unintentionally become kidnappers when their client is murdered while they are employed to abduct an 11-year-old girl Cho-hee.           “I tried to put a lot of metaphors into the character of Cho-hee,” director Hong Eu-jung said. “I hope that the audience can see that as well. As for now, she should [still be] kept under the veil.”           Although ""Voice of Silence"" is director Hong’s debut feature film, Yoo Ah-in praised the director.           “I was in awe,” the actor said. “[Hong] has the talent to take [a narrative] that is very unique and mix it up with mundane factors — things that really feel like it could happen in our everyday lives — to stimulate our minds and [ask questions] that have never been discussed before. I strongly believe that Hong is set to become a great filmmaker.”           “There’s always a feeling of anticipation when the actor receives a script, curious to find out what kind of story it is,” Yoo Jae-myung said. “When I read ‘Voice of Silence,’ it was a strange experience — like the title, the story was colorful and rich without a sound. The metaphors were strong, to the point, and the overall narrative was intense but to the point as well.”           “It’s also very contemporary,” Yoo Ah-in added. “We come across so many news and stories, and people question what stance they should take in such a matter — about what’s right and wrong, what’s good and bad. The film also asks the world what defines the standards. It’s got a voice.”           The film is set to premiere next month.             BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "

272,Convenience store lunch box sales up on social distancing,"

     Three office workers are eating doshirak lunch boxes at a convenience store in Jung District, central Seoul, on Sept. 17. [NEWS1]               One of the big winners in the pandemic is the humble convenience store lunch box, the standby of the harried office worker becoming the default choice for many as social distancing keeps them from cafes and restaurants.           The sales of doshirak, or lunch boxes, were up 26 percent on year at 7-Eleven in August. At Emart24, they rose by 28 percent over the same period.           “In the past, seolleongtang, or Korean ox bone soup, was considered a go-to menu when people ate alone. Now, since many people avoid eating with other people due to concern of infections, office workers go to convenience stores and buy a lunch box, coffee and snacks and finish their lunch at their desks,” said an office worker.               Convenience store chain GS25 said the sale of lunch boxes rose 5.8 percent when sales between Aug. 15 to Sept. 14 are compared to sales during the month earlier period. In metropolitan areas, sales are up 8.1 percent during the same period.           “Even though foot traffic decreased from more office workers working remotely at home, we've seen a steady increase in customers looking for doshirak to eat lunch alone,” said a GS Retail executive.             Convenience stores are actively developing inventive lunch box products.           GS25 introduced the Paldo Charim lunch box series on Sept. 18, a variety of meal boxes that use regional ingredients from eight provinces. One in the series that recently hit the shelves is a braised pork lunch box topped with garlic sauce made with the Uiseong garlic harvested in the Uiseong area of North Gyeongsang.             On Sept. 15, 7-Eleven introduced a series of lunch boxes with actress Kim Su-mi, who owns Napalkkot F&B. According to the company, Kim participated from the start to the finish in the making of the lunch box products.           Lunch boxes started selling at convenience stores in 2009. They were considered a cheap meal customers bought when no other options were available, and only accounted for 10 percent in the sales of ready-made meals at convenience stores. The market started growing in 2015 as major convenience stores started improving the quality of ingredients and diversifying the offerings.           “After local convenience stores started launching premium in-house brands of doshirak four to five years ago, the market for convenience store meal boxes took a huge turn,” said an industry executive.             “As the pandemic changed how people eat, I think the popularity of convenience store lunch boxes will continue on in the second half.”           BY BAE JUNG-WON   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
273,The once-mighty Bears are just clinging on to a playoff spot,"

     The Doosan Bears celebrate after picking up a 6-5 come-from-behind victory against the LG Twins at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in southern Seoul on Sunday. [NEWS1]                The Doosan Bears' dominance of the KBO appears to be well and truly over, at least for the rest of this season.          Since 2015, the Bears have always been the team to beat in the fight for the Korean Series. They've won the championship three times in the five seasons since 2015, still reaching the Korean Series in the other two years and ending up as runner up.          Looking at their regular seasons standing, the Bears always finish within the top three. Their worst finish in the regular season over the last five years was in 2015, at third. Other than that, the Bears have either won or finished second in the regular season. Last year the Bears took the top spot on the very last day.           However, in the delayed 2020 season, the Bears are not looking too good. With the Jamsil Derby taking place over the weekend, the Bears slipped as low as sixth place after losing the first game to the LG Twins 9-6.            Thanks to a 6-5 come-from-behind victory on Sunday, the Bears moved back up a spot to fifth, the last postseason spot. This was a long-awaited victory for the Bears as they were wallowing in a four-game losing streak.                       Looking at the Bears’ roster this season, there aren’t any major changes compared to their championship roster last season, with the notable exception of ace pitcher Josh Lindblom. The absence and struggles of veterans due to injuries have also been crucial.            Ahead of this season, the Bears lost Lindblom as he headed back to the major league right after winning the 2019 Korean Series. While the Bears have traditionally been very good at plugging holes in their batting line-up, pitching has often been a struggle.           This season is no exception.            Along with the absence of Lindblom, the Bears also lack 2019 closer Lee Hyeong-beom, who is out with an injury. Due to this, manager Kim Tae-hyung made an interesting decision midway through the season, where he decided to switch the positions of two pitchers — starter Lee Young-ha and closer Ham Deok-ju.            In addition to swapping two well-established pitchers, Kim also changed the team's captain.            The Bears’ long-standing captain Oh Jae-won may have earned Kim’s trust despite his poor performance, but as his struggle continued this season, Kim decided to pass the role on to Oh Jae-il.            It didn't seem to make much difference.           As of Monday, the Bears are ranked fifth in the regular season standing with 59 wins, four draws and 49 losses. They are a full two games behind the fourth-ranked Twins and only 0.5 games ahead of the sixth-ranked Kia Tigers.            Since the teams have less than 40 games remaining until the end of the regular season with a demanding schedule ahead of them including double headers and Monday games, little mistakes could push the Bears out of the postseason race.            Looking toward the top of the regular season standing, the KT Wiz are causing a bit of an upset. Currently on a five-game winning streak as of Monday, the Wiz moved up to third in the regular season standing with 63 wins, one draw and 47 losses. They are only one game behind the second-ranked Kiwoom Heroes and 3.5 games behind the top-ranked NC Dinos.            The Wiz’s position in the regular standing is unexpected, as they started the season very poorly. Up until June 30, the Wiz were not even close to earning a postseason spot as they were ranked eighth in the league with 11.5 games behind the top-ranked Dinos. In fact, the Wiz have never qualified for the playoffs.           But starting in July, they started climbing slowly through the ranks and are now sitting comfortably at third.            Elsewhere over the weekend, the Dinos got some breathing room by picking up wins in both games of their double header against the Lotte Giants on Sunday. After Saturday’s game, where the Dinos lost to the Giants 5-1, they were barely holding onto their lead, just a game ahead of the Heroes. Thanks to that double header, the Changwon club managed to extend their lead to 2.5 games.            Although the Giants have a very slim chance of earning a spot in the postseason, their 2020 season hasn't been terrible. Currently sitting at seventh, the Giants still have a winning percentage above 0.500.          Normally, only the top five teams have a winning percentage above 0.500, so that threshold tends to be a major goal for the manager and coaching staff each season. This year, the performance of the lowest-ranked teams has been bad enough to leave the 0.500 door open for the top seven teams.          Starting Tuesday, the KBO will continue its season with a two-game series. The Twins will host the SK Wyverns at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in southern Seoul while the Giants will host the Wiz at Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan. In Changwon, the Dinos will host the Samsung Lions while the Heroes will be heading to Gwangju to play their two-game series against the Kia Tigers. The Bears will head to Daejeon to play their two-game series against the Hanwha Eagles.           All five games will start at 6:30 p.m.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]         "

276,X-ray exhibit offers a rare glimpse inside Korea's national treasures,"

           Earthenware Funerary Object in the Shape of a Warrior on Horseback, National Treasure No. 91. Researchers at the National Museum of Korea recently found out through a CT scan that this Silla relic used to be a kettle. [NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA]               “Don’t believe everything you see, until you see it through a scanner.”           This catchy phrase is a popular quote agreed on among conservation scientists at the National Museum of Korea, where the significance of medical equipment like CT and M.R.I. scanners and X-ray machines increases every day.           Unsurprisingly, this equipment is not being used to check the health conditions of the national museum's most important and degraded cultural properties. Instead, they offer a rare insight into the items that would otherwise be completely hidden to researchers.           For example, it was the Wooden Shakyamuni Buddha during the Joseon Dynasty's (1392-1910) turn to undergo a CT scan for the first time in 2017. As it was severely degraded, conservation scientists had only been able to superficially analyze it for fear of causing damage.               The Wooden Shakyamuni Buddha of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). [NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA]       An X-ray image of the Wooden Shakyamuni Buddha of the Joseon Dynasty shows a small container inside. [NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA]               Thanks to the CT scan, scientists were able to find out that there is a small container used to contain fabrics and papers hidden inside the statue.             The Buddha’s CT scan is just one example.           To showcase how much advanced equipment is used inside the Conservation Science Division at the National Museum of Korea, the state-run museum has organized a special exhibition titled, “The Science of Light: Revealing the Secrets of Cultural Properties.”           The exhibit was supposed to kick off in late August, but as the museum was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the exhibition was moved online until the museum doors can reopen.                ""The Science of Light: Revealing the Secrets of Cultural Properties"" exhibit at the National Museum of Korea in central Seoul. The offline exhibit will begin when the museum reopens. [NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA]               On display are 57 cultural properties alongside the X-ray images, scanned pictures and videos to help visitors better understand how medical technology can also benefit and uncover the secrets of Korea’s cultural heritage.           One of the most important secrets revealed through the use of this technology is the illusive purpose of the Earthenware Funerary Object in the Shape of a Warrior on Horseback, which is designated as National Treasure No. 91.           Until recently, this valuable treasure was thought to be a funerary ornament, found buried inside an ancient Silla tomb called Geumnyeongchong in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang.           It was excavated in 1924 and was roughly restored in 1977 by the museum’s Conservation Science Division, which was only established the previous year. But it was only recently, when the museum conducted another round of CT scans, that it was discovered that the warrior on horseback is actually a kettle that can contain 240 milliliters (8 ounces) of liquid.           “We don’t know if our ancestors used it to pour water or alcohol, or both,” said an official from the Conservation Science Division. “But through the recent CT scan, we were able to confirm that it is a kettle.”           The exhibition also showcases how technological advancements can help scientists investigate and analyze cultural properties and learn about historical attributes that are inaccessible to the naked eye, and therefore may have otherwise remained locked within the cultural properties.           One example is the portrait of Choe Chiwon from the Joseon Dynasty.           According to the museum, its conservation scientists conducted an X-ray and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy in 2009 after noticing that the bottom right corner of the portrait had been painted over.           Through the scan, they found there used to be a young monk underneath the current depiction of books and writing utensils. The museum explained that the researchers “assume the monk was painted over with stacks of books because Buddhism began to become less popular in Joseon dynasty.”           They were also able to find out when the portrait was painted and by whom, as the name and date had also been painted over.           In 2015, in order to restore them to their original state, the museum conducted various tests on Joseon Dynasty water droppers using modern technology. To their surprise, the scientists discovered that the inner containers have the shape of a haetae, or mythical unicorn lion.             Lee Young-beom, the curator of the exhibit, said the advanced technology also plays an important role in restoring damaged cultural properties.           “It’s similar to the medical procedures conducted by doctors to treat patients,” said Lee. “With the machines, we determine how to best manage damaged cultural properties after identifying the materials involved and the severity of the damage.”              Conservation scientists at the National Museum of Korea take an X-ray of a Buddhist statue. [NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREA]               To make the online exhibition a little more special, various video clips are available on the museum’s official website, such as “Medical check-up day of Gilt-bronze Pensive Maitreya Bodhisattva, the National Treasure No. 78.”           The video features the Bodhisattva waiting patiently inside the conservation science lab for a check-up. The scientists carefully approach the Buddha and first inspect him with the naked eye. They then start conducting various scans to see if it has deteriorated over the years.           On that day, the Buddha went under a microscope, then a 3-D scan, then an X-ray and finally a CT scan. There are other tests as well, but as the scientists said, because the Buddha could become tired from too many tests in one day, they limit the number of tests each day.             The exhibit can be viewed by accessing the museum’s website, museum.go.kr. The exhibition will run until Nov. 15.             BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]   "
277,Shin Min-a sees a bit of herself in character in 'Diva',"

     Shin Min-a [MEGABOX PLUS M]                “When I first received the script, I was really excited — scripts [centered around] women are rare, so I felt that it was precious,” actor Shin Min-a said about the film ""Diva"" during an online group interview Thursday.           In the six years since romantic comedy “My Love, My Bride,” the actor has not been idle. She had crossed over to television with “Oh! My Venus” on KBS (2015-2016), “Tomorrow, With You” (2017) on tvN and “Chief of Staff” on JTBC last year.             “Honestly, I didn't realize that it had been six years until I had that number held right in front of me,"" Shin said. ""I didn't intend to, it’s just that I’ve been focusing on the drama series. I chose a film that drew me, and since it took a long time to it get my film out to the public, this is special to me.”           In “Diva,” which hits local theaters Wednesday, Shin portrays Yi-young, a world-class diver, a star athlete that everyone reveres. Her best friend, Soo-jin (played by Lee You-young), also a diver, failed to set a record for years. One day, the two are in a terrible car accident in which Soo-jin goes missing and Yi-young has partial amnesia. Concerned for her friend and struggling to get herself back in the game, she grapples with the trauma from the accident and the fact that her best friend may not be someone who she thought she was.              Scene from the film. Actor Shin Min-a as Yi-young, a diving diva that everyone looks up to. [MEGABOX PLUS M]       Yi-young and her best friend Soo-jin talking in their dormitory. [MEGABOX PLUS M]               Although on a totally different career path, Shin said that she sympathized with her protagonist’s struggles.             “[Both of the] professions are something that’s constantly being evaluated,” Shin said. “I need to produce a result [that also satisfies the public], so I think there’s a similarity in that. Also, in some of the diving scenes, even those that I was confident, I felt my body becoming rigid. So I was able to indirectly experience [what Yi-young felt]. As an actor, although it may be to the extent that other people won’t be aware [if I’m feeling down], I still have to control my emotions and stay mentally strong.”              Yi-young surrounded by the press after she leaves the hospital to go back on her training. [MEGABOX PLUS M]               Shin explained that although Yi-young’s circumstances and the complexity of her emotions might be unique, overall it wasn’t that much different from what people feel in their jobs as well, which is why the actor thought the audience could relate to Yi-young’s emotions.             “In a competitive society, I certainly believe that a lot of what Yi-young tackles overlaps with what people are faced with in their jobs,” she said. “Although the specific topic of diving may be unique, the stories and the emotions are of something ubiquitous.”             But Shin admitted that the feeling of standing alone on the top of the diving board, where the crowd is watching her every move, was somewhat different.             “That was really special,” Shin said. “Before I fell, I could see everyone focusing on [the minute movements like] my breathing, and it was strange that I could see all that from the top. I think Yi-young’s trail of emotions match up really well with how she dives.”           Just like a professional athlete, in the majority of the scenes, her hair is pulled back into a tight bun, her face is bare and she is in a tight swimsuit.           “Diving professionals have to completely pull back their hair and the swimming suits have to be really tight due to the water resistance,” Shin said. “And portraying that and seeing myself on the screen was strange, alien. I tried to replicate the look they have as best as I could, and since diving wasn’t a sport that I knew very well, I watched a lot of the footage of the games of the athletes to familiarize myself with the [professional] aura of these athletes.”              Shin Min-a [MEGABOX PLUS M]                The actor also expressed satisfaction about reviews on her performance in her latest drama series “Chief of Staff” and “Diva.”             “I heard ‘Chief’ and ‘Diva’ showed new sides of me,” Shin said. “For an actor, [hearing such compliments] is always flattering and exhilarating. [But simultaneously,] as I scanned through the articles after the press event for ‘Diva,’ I didn't realize until then that the public connected me so strongly with the lovely image.""             “But it’s true that such performances I thought I was good at and was used to,” Shin continued. “From now on, I’m going to choose projects that I haven’t tried before, [stories] that satisfy both myself and the public.”           However, Shin said that her passion for acting has always existed over the years, although she hadn't had the chance to express them, as she reminisces back on her years.                Shin Min-a [MEGABOX PLUS M]                “It’s been always there, but I don’t think I’ve had the opportunity to show them,” Shin said. “I’ve always cherished all of my roles, and enjoyed portraying them, and I think people saw that in my recent roles, which I’m really glad about.""             Like diving is everything that matters for Yi-young, Shin feels the same for her profession.           “I started this job from a very young age, and now I can think of nothing else I would have done if I didn’t become an actor,” Shin said. “Like Yi-young, acting is [what describes] my entire life, and it’s become a friend that’s going to be with me for the rest of my life as well.”              Shin Min-a [MEGABOX PLUS M]                The actor hasn’t decided on her next film yet, but she promises that it won’t take as long as six years.             “I hope to meet again soon with another side of me,” she said. “[But for now,] I hope that the audience can choose this film to see it in theaters, if the circumstances allow. Whether or not the film can become a success is not within my ability now, so I’m not going to dwell on that. But for those who can sympathize even a little bit with Yi-young’s feelings, I hope they can see the film [in theaters].”             BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "

        Name: Gold Waist Belt from Cheonmachong Tomb   Period: Silla (57 B.C. to A.D. 935)   Location: Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang   Status: National Treasure No. 190           A belt made of cloth is called a gwadae.           Attached to the belt are rectangular forms made of metal.           This Korean gwadae influenced by China is decorated with valuable objects such as jadeite and commodities such as a small knife, a case for drugs, a whetstone, a flint and tweezers.           According to lessons of formality called Yegi from China, when people performed ancestral rites, they should have a towel, a grindstone, a small cup and an iron flint on the left side of their belt.           On the right side are a set of bone instruments called gyeol (worn on the thumb and used in archery), an instrument called gwan which is used to suspend strings on a bow (in archery) and a large cup.           The color, number and material of it represented the wearer's government position in the Baekje (18 B.C. to 660 A.D.) and Silla Dynasty.           Exhumed from the North Tomb of Hwangnam-dong in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, the golden gwadae is 125 centimeters (49 inches) in length and the yopae which is worn with the gwadae, is 22.5 to 73.5 centimeters in length.           The gwadae is ornamented with 44 rectangular forms made out of metal and has nine holes around it for linking leather or metal rings.           The yopae is another ornament with 13 ropes in the shape of an ellipse and quadrangle.           Both the gwadae and yopae were found fastened around the waist of the tomb's occupant.

280,KMA outsider Nam Yeong-shin selected as Army chief of staff,"

     President Moon Jae-in, left, and Gen. Nam Yeong-shin, who was nominated Monday as Korea's next Army chief of staff, at Nam's appointment ceremony to be head of the Ground Operations Command in April last year. [YONHAP]               Four-star General Nam Yeong-shin was nominated as Korea’s Army chief of staff Monday, making him the first commander of the country’s land forces in a half-century not to have been trained at the influential Korea Military Academy (KMA).             Nam, 58, will also be the first Army chief of staff from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), according to the Ministry of National Defense on Monday, which said it made the selection based solely on merit and character rather than background and schooling.             Since its foundation in 1948, the Korean Army has never been led by an ROTC figure. For 51 years since 1969, the position has been filled by generals from the powerful KMA, whose members effectively ruled the country through military juntas headed by generals-turned-Presidents Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan.          Nam’s nomination is part of a recent major reshuffle of Korea’s top brass, which has so far been nothing short of radical in terms of the number of conventions it's broken.            Incumbent President Moon Jae-in, who was part of a massive civic movement that prompted military rulers to devolve power to civilian hands in 1987, swore early in his term to break down entrenched military traditions that have buttressed the KMA’s continued dominance.             It was in such a context that Moon pushed through the appointments of Song Young-moo and Jeong Kyeong-doo, who headed the Navy and Air Force, respectively, as his administration’s first and second defense ministers.          Moon’s choice for Jeong’s successor, Gen. Suh Wook, earlier this month was ostensibly a conventional one, given Suh’s background as Army chief of staff and a KMA graduate.             But the president also appointed Air Force Chief of Staff Won In-choul, who belongs to a graduating class a year ahead of Suh, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).            It is rare in the Korean military that a figure from a junior class is appointed above an older officer, and the move was interpreted as the Blue House’s attempt to check the KMA's influence over the armed forces.             The intent has been made even more clearer with Nam’s nomination, given that the general became an officer the same year as Suh did.           Nam’s military career also testifies to why he has been chosen to head the Army in spite of the controversy his selection may generate among his KMA-trained subordinates.             Before he was appointed head of the Army’s Ground Operations Command in April 2019, Nam oversaw a major overhaul of the military’s counterintelligence arm, the Defense Security Command, after it was implicated in a plot to wrest power from civilian hands if former President Park Geun-hye had not been removed from office in 2017.            Nam has been credited with leading the transition and reform smoothly as the first commander of the newly formed Defense Security Support Command.          BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]        "
281,K League reaches split with some last-minute surprises,"

                  The 12 clubs in the top Korean football league were split into two groups on Sunday, with some late drama seeing clubs in the middle of the table switch places.           Gwangju FC beat Seongnam FC 2-0 to jump from eighth to sixth, grabbing the last spot for ""Final A"" in the K League 1's split format. Gangwon FC's 2-1 loss to Suwon Samsung Bluewings opened the door for Gwangju to sneak through.           With the top six clubs in Final A, the rest ended up in Final B. Teams will then close out the season by playing five matches within their own group.           Clubs in Final A are guaranteed to finish no lower than sixth in the final table. This is Gwangju's first season in the K League 1 after earning a promotion from the K League 2, and they've assured themselves of another season with the big boys.           Those in Final B, on the other hand, all face the danger of relegation to the K League 2, with the last-place Incheon United and seventh-place FC Seoul separated by only seven points.           The top five spots had already been sealed before Sunday, with Ulsan Hyundai FC, Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, Sangju Sangmu, Pohang Steelers and Daegu FC occupying those places.           Much of the suspense on this day, when all six matches kicked off at 3 p.m., came from contests involving teams in the middle.           Gangwon FC entered Sunday's match against Suwon in sixth place with 24 points and they controlled their own destiny. All they needed to do was to beat a slumping club that had won just once in their past eight matches and the sixth spot would be Gangwon's.           Kim Ji-hyun gave Gangwon a lead in the 53rd at Gangneung Stadium in Gangneung, Gangwon. But Suwon rallied with two late goals for a 2-1 win, as Han Suk-jong's header off an 82nd minute free kick proved to be the difference.           Gwangju did their part by beating Seongnam on the road, with Felipe and Doo Hyeon-seok scoring a goal apiece.           FC Seoul, who were also in the hunt for sixth place, settled for seventh after a scoreless draw against Daegu FC.           With a combination of Gangwon's loss, Gwangju's victory and FC Seoul's draw, Gangwon fell all the way to eighth.           Seongnam, Busan, Suwon and Incheon rounded out the bottom four.           By upsetting Gangwon, Suwon gave themselves some breathing room over Incheon for the relegation spot at 21 points. Incheon remained stuck at 18.           Elsewhere, Ulsan blanked Incheon 1-0 to remain in first place. Ulsan had lost to Jeonbuk 2-1 Tuesday to have their lead over Jeonbuk cut to just two points, but Junior Negrão delivered his league-leading 24th goal of the season to help Ulsan fend off pesky Incheon.           Jeonbuk kept pace with Ulsan thanks to a 2-0 victory over Busan IPark.           In perhaps the least consequential but most entertaining match of Sunday, Pohang defeated Sangju 4-3 behind Aleksandar Palocevic's hat trick to move into third place over the military club. Pohang and Sangju both have 38 points, but Pohang have the substantial edge in the goals scored tiebreaker, 41-29.           Pohang led 2-0 at halftime with Palocevic scoring both goals, but Sangju leveled the score with two goals in one minute near the hour mark. Pohang broke the tie in the 77th, only to have Sangju respond in the 88th.           Then Palocevic capped off the barrage for Pohang with his third goal of the match moments before the final whistle.           Yonhap   "
282,Records tumble as Son and Kane offer a footballing masterclass,"

                           Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur takes a shot during an English Premier League (EPL) match against Southampton at St. Mary's Stadium in Southampton, Britain on Sunday. [AFP/YONHAP]               Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur made history again on Sunday, becoming the first-ever Korean footballer to score a hat trick in the English Premier League (EPL).           If that wasn't enough, Son became the 28th player in the history of the EPL to score four goals in a single game during the match against Southampton on Sunday, and he did it with just four shots on goal.           Son achieved the feat in Spurs’ dominant 5-2 victory over Southampton at St. Mary’s Stadium in Southampton, Britain.           Southampton opened the scoring with a goal from Danny Ings in the 32nd minute in the midst of a relatively quiet half for Spurs. Son’s equalizer came in the last moments of the second half, putting the score at 1-1 going into the break.           Son very quickly put Spurs ahead in the 47th minute — achieving the unheard of feat of scoring two minutes into injury time in the first half, the 47th minute of play, and again in the actual 47th minute of play at the start of the second half — before adding a third goal in the 64th minute and a fourth in the 73rd.           Son became only the second Asian player — after Shinji Kagawa for Manchester United back in 2013 — to score a hat trick in a Premier League match.          “I think it’s a great honor for me,”  Son told Spurs TV after the match. ""[Scoring] Spurs' first goal [of the season] and scoring [my] first hat trick, [in the] Premier League, with Spurs.""           Harry Kane then added a fifth goal in the 82nd minute to give Spurs a 5-1 lead. A penalty from Ings in the 90th minute gave Southampton one consolation goal to end the game at 5-2.           “What can I say,” Son said. “I’m very proud and I’m very grateful.”            Son is the 28th player ever to score four goals in the Premier League era, joining the venerable company of Premier League legends such as Alan Shearer, Michael Owen and Thierry Henry, and more recently Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero and Spurs’ own Kane.            Son is the only Korean footballer to ever achieve the feat. In fact, Son became the first Asian player to ever score four goals in one game in any of Europe's top five leagues — the EPL, Germany's Bundesliga, France's Ligue 1, Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga.           Son wasn’t the only Spurs player to enter the history books during Saturday’s game. With four assists, one for every one of Son’s goals, Kane became the seventh player ever to pick up four assists in an EPL game.            Kane is the first player ever to assist the same teammate four times in one match.           Although he rained down goals throughout the second half of the match, Son felt that his equalizer at the very end of the first half was the most important of all.            “I think it was very important especially in the first half because we struggled a little bit,” Son said, “because we didn’t bring what we wanted. Obviously, the equalizer was very important to finish [the] first half strong. You can see, after [the] equalizer, when we came out for [the] second half, we scored straight away again. I think it was a very important time to score this goal. I’m very happy to get this victory away from home.”           Although Son’s four goals made the headlines, Son himself and head coach Jose Mourinho were quick to point out Kane's role in the match.           “I know that everyone will say Sonny is Man of the Match because it’s an incredible achievement to score four goals in the Premier League,” Mourinho was quoted as saying on Spurs' website. “But I am a team coach, I am all about my team and what Harry did for us is an example of the guy who is not going to have the highlights on him, but is fundamental for the team.”           Son also thanked Kane following the match.            ""I’m grateful for having this opportunity and grateful for the teammates and especially to Harry,” Son said to Spurs TV. “He’s amazing, amazing performance from him. He’s an amazing person.”           Statistically, Son and Kane really are shaping up to be the perfect pair on the pitch. Since August 2015, when Son joined Spurs, the two have teamed up on 24 Premier League goals, more than any other duo in the league over the same time period.            With the win, Spurs are ranked sixth in the Premier League standing with a win and a loss, totaling three points. Despite Spurs’ struggle in the first half of the match, Son expressed his satisfaction with the win.           “Obviously we struggled in the first half but a win is a win,"" Son told Spurs TV. ""In the second half, we bring [a] really, really strong performance. The performance, we have to bring it from the start. We have to control the game and dominate the game from the start. Obviously, we have to learn this. Now, it’s the start of the season, moving forward, we are looking to be better and better.”            Son was already looking good before the season started last week. Prior to the start of the 2020-21 season, Son seemed to be in perfect shape in the pre-season friendlies.            He started off by scoring two goals during Spurs’ first friendly match against Ipswich Town on Aug. 22.           Then, against Reading on Aug. 28, Son scored another in the 39th minute to help Spurs pick up a 4-1 victory in their second friendly. Not only was Son able to score in two straight matches, but his goal against Reading also marked the fifth anniversary of the day he signed with Spurs.           Son was back in action in Spurs’ third friendly against Birmingham on Aug. 29. Spurs won the match 1-0, although Son didn't score. Spurs lost their last friendly against Watford 2-1, but Son once again managed to score and for the first time in his career with the Premier League club, he wore the captain’s armband.            Spurs will continue its season with a third round match of the EFL Cup against Leyton Orient on Tuesday.            The London club's Premier League campaign will continue on Sunday against Newcastle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.            BY KANG YOO-RIM, JIM BULLEY   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

286,"Work at home is not as easy as it sounds, ministry says","

                                         Korea's Labor Ministry has published guidelines defining ""remote work"" and how exactly companies should manage employees working from home.             The Ministry of Employment and Labor on Wednesday released a work-from-home manual to reduce confusion surrounding the issue. As the coronavirus pandemic drags on, there's been a consensus developing that companies should adopt remote work policies. But there's no agreement on what these should be.           Accessible on the ministry's website, the 21-page manual discusses a variety of aspects regarding working from home. It includes answers to frequently asked questions about break time, productivity management and accidents.             According to the manual, work from home is fundamentally based on a consensus between employee and the employer. If there are no grounds for remote work, the employer can reject an employee's request for it.             Hours are the same as a regular workday, but depending on the situation, the company may allow for flexible working hours. The Labor Standards Act offers two options for calculating working hours for companies where hours are not consistent. Either the employer can decide on a fixed number, assuming the employee had worked those hours regardless of the actual time spent on labor, or it can fix a figure with the company's labor union.             The manual makes it clear that an employee leaving a designated workspace without the employer’s permission or engaging in personal activities during work hours can violate employment and office regulations.             The manual also states family emergencies, taking care of a sick family member, or simple tasks like taking a shower or answering phone calls should be tolerated. ""The employer needs to be understanding of activities that are acceptable by social norms,"" the manual advised.             Working at cafes instead of home is only allowed with prior permission or an agreement with employers. Changing the work location without the employer’s approval may violate office regulations.           One question submitted to the ministry asked whether it is unfair to shut down employee's connection to the company's server automatically if his or her computer mouse doesn't move for a certain period of time. The ministry said no, arguing that it could create a stressful working environment and have an impact on employee health and the organization's productivity as a whole.           The manual also states that tracking the employee’s location without consent is outlawed. Under Korean law, collecting location information without the subject's consent is prohibited. In order to obtain the location information of employees working from home, the company must obtain their consent regarding its purpose, length of time the information will be retained and the right to dissent. The employer cannot exert any pressure on the employee in this discussion.           Some companies cover transport expenses for their employees. The ministry said that it is not easy to say whether this should be paid, though it did note that the payment must be made if it is agreed to by contract, whether the employee commutes or not.             Another issue was accidents and injuries while working at home. According to the manual, even if an accident takes place at home, work-related injuries or illnesses are considered occupational accidents.             If the injury is the result of a personal activity unrelated to work, like tripping while going shopping at a neighborhood convenience store, it will not be counted as an occupational accident. But falling down in the middle of a trip to the toilet during office hours can be compensated as an occupational accident. This is because under Korea's labor law, accidents that happen while fulfilling basic needs during work hours are recognized as ""occupational"" as well.           BY JEONG HYE-JEONG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

288,Daily infections drop below 100 but untraceable cases cause concern ,"

     Basketball fans virtually root during a match between the Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus and the Changwon LG Sakers in the 2020 MG Saemaeul Vault KBL Cup Competition held Sunday at the Gunsan Wolmyeong Gymnasium in Gunsan, North Jeolla. [YONAHP]         Korea added 82 new cases of the coronavirus Saturday, the first time in 38 days that the figure dropped below 100.           Health authorities announced the milestone Sunday, but in the same breath warned that the proportion of untraceable infections was reaching new highs lately, which means epidemiologists aren’t sure how and where some patients contracted the disease, heightening the risk of inadvertent transmission in local society.           Among 1,798 people who were diagnosed with the virus over the past two weeks from Sept. 6 to Saturday, 493 people, or 27.4 percent, were in this untraceable category, said the Central Disease Control Headquarters. The corresponding percentage had been steadily rising for several days until it peaked at 28.1 percent on Friday.           The government’s goal is to push untraceable infections down to below 5 percent of all new infections, like it successfully did for many days in April and May.           Health officials also remained cautious about celebrating Saturday’s breakthrough of 82 new cases, saying fewer people tend to get tested over weekends, which might have caused the significant drop.           Some 14,500 people got tested nationwide Thursday, 12,800 on Friday and 7,500 on Saturday.           Korea added 126 new cases Thursday and 110 on Friday. It normally takes about one or two days for a coronavirus test result to be confirmed.           The last time Korea had fewer than 100 daily new infections was when 56 new cases were reported on Aug. 12, the day that a congregant at the Sarang Jeil Church in Seongbuk District, central Seoul, was diagnosed with the virus — and soon led to the second-largest cluster of infections Korea has ever seen to date.           Daily cases at one point soared to 441 on Aug. 26. Between 100 and 200 cases had been reported prior to Saturday for over two weeks straight, irritating health officials trying to push cases down as low as possible before the Chuseok holidays begin on Sept. 30.                            Health authorities Sunday said they expect the Chuseok holidays to pose a huge risk for another outbreak, which is why they’ve decided to extend Level 2 social distancing measures for regions outside the Seoul metropolitan area for another week until Sept. 27.           Level 2 measures for the greater Seoul area had already been extended until Sept. 27 last week, which means the entire nation will fall under the same Level 2 measures until Sept. 27.             In explaining why regions outside the Seoul metropolitan area has to go through another week of Level 2 restrictions in the three-tier social distancing system, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters explained Sunday there were still too many infections sporadically popping up all over the nation, plus the fact that a big portion of them was untraceable.           The headquarters said it also factored in the fact that Chuseok is around the corner.           Health authorities have already warned that the entire nation will go through yet another set of new restrictions for two weeks from Sept. 28 in time for the holidays, the specifics of which will be revealed early this week.           As for school re-openings, in-person classes are set to resume in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi on Monday for the first time in 26 days after all students except high school seniors — who are preparing for the annual College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) — were forced to stay home to engage in online learning.             Through Oct. 11, kindergartens, elementary and middle schools will be required to run their classrooms up to a third of their full capacities, while high schools will run up to two-thirds.            Schools outside the Seoul metropolitan area will have to follow the same guidelines during the same period, though some school districts can allow more students in classrooms after consultation with the Education Ministry.           Among Saturday’s 82 new cases, 72 were local infections, including 28 in Seoul, 24 in Gyeonggi, six in Busan, four in North Gyeongsang, three in Incheon, two in Daegu and one each in Daejeon, Ulsan, North Chungcheong, South Chungcheong and South Gyeongsang.            Out of 10 imported cases, three were from India, two from Turkey and one each from Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Germany and the United States.             Five people died Saturday, bringing total deaths to 383, while 188 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 20,158. As of Saturday at midnight, Korea had counted 22,975 virus patients in all.           While new clusters have been sporadically appearing in numerous parts of the nation, the Sarang Jeil Church cluster has effectively stopped growing at 1,168, the last patient of whom was diagnosed on Sept. 11.           The Seoul Metropolitan Government last Friday announced it would sue the controversial Presbyterian church and its head pastor, Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, for indemnity worth 4.62 billion won ($4 million). The city office accused them of hampering government measures to prevent the spread of the virus by submitting fake records of its congregants and visitors, and refusing to cooperate with epidemiological efforts.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

[KT]               The Covid-19 pandemic left hospitals around the world grappling with the need to treat patients while avoiding infection, both of medical staff and other people. One solution was ""telehealth"" — the practice of offering remote access to health care services online.           Digital healthcare, which includes telehealth, start-ups in the United States attracted $5.4 billion of investment in the year’s first half, a new record. China and Japan saw telehealth users surge after the spread of Covid-19. China permitted telehealth services between doctors and patients in 2014, while Japan did so in 2015.           Korea doesn't have the same telehealth history. Despite discussions having started two decades ago, domestic law does not allow medical services to be handled remotely between doctors and patients. Regulations on DNA testing and medical data usage are also obstacles to the development of digital healthcare start-ups in Korea.           “There’s a score of Korean companies with advanced technology that are doing business overseas due to regulatory restrictions on telehealth,” said an April report from the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI).           Neofect, for example, is a manufacturer of smart gloves used in rehabilitating hand injuries. The glove is sold in more than 30 countries worldwide, but isn’t allowed in Korea because it is monitored by healthcare professionals remotely, making it technically telehealth.            Another prominent telehealth company in Japan is Naver’s subsidiary, Line. The portal site also does not run its medical services in Korea.           So the issue clearly isn’t technology. In fact, Korean hospitals may be some of the most digitized in the world when it comes to data. According to a 2018 study by the Ministry of Science and ICT, 92 percent of local patients have electronic medical records, higher than Europe’s 84 percent and the United States’ 60 percent.           Another major obstacle limiting the development of telehealth is the strong opposition from local doctors.           In late February, the government granted a temporary easing of regulations to allow doctors to consult and prescribe medicine over the phone, as long as doctors approved that doing so would not cause health risks.             The Korean Medical Association (KMA) immediately fired back, saying its doctors would refuse to take part in a practice that it claimed would reduce the accuracy and efficiency of patient diagnosis and treatment. Opposition to the government’s drive to develop telehealth was even one of the reasons for the recent doctors' strike.           Choi Yoon-sup, co-founder of medical start-up accelerator Digital Healthcare Partners (DHP), says the discussion on telehealth is more than a simple yes-or-no question.           “Telehealth can mean so many things according to how the blanks are filled in: Who would offer what service, when, to whom and in what way. The impact and scope of telehealth greatly differs accordingly and if discussions are not built upon a consensus of what telehealth would look like, progress is difficult,” he said.           “Without solving the fundamental problems in Korea’s medical system or coming up with a more concrete idea, merely allowing telehealth to happen will just spur a bunch of side effects.”           One of these “fundamental issues” is the local system where patients, even those with light symptoms, are allowed to go directly to large-sized hospitals without first going to a local doctor, leaving local clinics competing with bigger institutions.            If telehealth is allowed in such circumstances, the system could take more business away from local doctors that are already competing with larger institutions.           Overseas, diagnosis of minor symptoms, observation of an illnesses progressing and fields like psychiatry and dermatology that require regular appointments benefit hugely from telehealth services.             BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]          "
290,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Is Korea out of its depth in hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine?,"

     A Celltrion researcher conducts tests at the company’s headquarters in Incheon. [CELLTRION]                                Korea has never been a major global player when it comes to medical exports — at least not until 2020.           In February, Korea was one of the first countries to deal with a serious Covid-19 outbreak. As the pandemic spread across the globe, some of Korea’s most effective measures to contain the spread of the virus garnered global interest, as did its masks, sanitizers and testing kits.           Suddenly, Korea went from a minor player in the global medical market to an expert in protective equipment and virus containment measures.            Exports grew accordingly. Hand sanitizer exports grew 67 times on year during the first half of 2020, while shipments of testing kits increased 507 percent during the same period.            With the confidence gained from that early success, the Korean government set its sights on the next big thing in the global fight against Covid-19: Drugs.           “Our goal is to develop a Covid-19 treatment by this year and a vaccine in 2021,” said Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) Commissioner Jeong Eun-kyeong during her opening remarks celebrating the launch of the agency on Sept. 15.           But government promises don’t always come true — especially in the field of biopharmaceuticals, where research and development (R&D) projects can go wrong any time.            So exactly where does Korea stand in this global race to find a Covid-19 treatment, and will the sudden push cause a fundamental change to the country’s biopharmaceutical industry?                           ━   Boosted confidence            Korea’s medical export breakthrough came from testing kits. By March, Seoul was receiving calls from other governments asking for diagnostic kit exports. Government figures show that the value of test kit exports hit a peak of $214 million in April, an eightfold jump compared to the previous month.           The confidence was clear in local stock prices, with a big boost to biopharmaceutical and medical equipment shares.           Many analysts raised concerns of a “bio bubble” existing in the market, and while this may be true from a short-term perspective, export and R&D figures show Korea’s bio industry did manage to achieve fundamental growth over the years.           According to data from the Korea Health Industry Development Institute, medical exports jumped from $8.9 billion in 2015 to $15.7 billion last year. In this year’s first half, Korea exported $9.6 billion worth of medical products, up 26.7 percent on year. Roughly half of that revenue did not come from Covid-19 related products, but biosimilar products.           “The recent trend shows similar patterns to 2015’s bio investment boom,” said Kiwoom Securities Analyst Heo Hye-min in a June report. ""But what’s different is that local health care companies’ global presence today is much stronger.""           But while Korea has made substantial progress in bio production technology, experts say developing new drugs from scratch is on an entirely different level.                  ━   Searching for a Covid-19 vaccine            Progress in treatment and vaccine development can be measured by stages of clinical trials.           Both vaccines and treatments are crucial for the fight against Covid-19, but they do very different jobs. While a vaccine prepares the body's immune system to fight off the disease, treatments are used when patients are already ill to lessen their symptoms and help them get better. A vaccine is a preventative measure, while a treatment helps somebody who is already sick.           At the moment, treatments are likely to be created quicker than vaccines because a lot of the drugs being tested contain elements that have previously been approved for other diseases. This strategy is called drug repositioning. It means the safety of the treatment has already been verified to a certain degree, and these drugs are often permitted to skip Phase 1 clinical trials. Nine Korean companies are currently developing repositioned drugs.           Drug development — whether for a vaccine or treatment — typically goes through a process of animal testing and three phases of clinical trials on human patients before a candidate is considered for authorization to be launched on the market.           As of mid-September, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has approved 11 treatment candidates to proceed with clinical trials for commercialization.           Among them, GC Pharma’s GC5131 and Celltrion’s CT-P59 are new substances and candidates that are receiving the most spotlight. These two companies were announced as government partners in the search for a Covid-19 treatment earlier this year, which implies they have a good chance of receiving authorization faster than others.           Celltrion’s CT-P59 recently completed its Phase 1 clinical trials on a group of 32 participants this month and received a nod to begin Phase 2 and 3 trials on Thursday.           A plasma treatment made from immune proteins extracted from recovered patients, GC Pharma’s GC5131 was approved to undergo Phase 2 clinical trials but has not yet started. It was exempted from conducting Phase 1 trials given the general safety of plasma treatments proven in other commercialized drugs.           Both candidate drugs are to start mass production this month ahead of market authorization so as to prepare stock in advance.           At the moment, California-based Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir is the only Covid-19 treatment that has completed Phase 3 trials in Korea and is currently in use at medical institutions after obtaining an emergency usage approval in July. Its degree of efficacy has been met with mixed reviews by medical experts, but it’s the only option authorized for safety and efficacy in treating coronavirus patients in Korea.           As for vaccines, two candidates are being tested on human patients in Korea: U.S. bio start-up Inovio’s INO-4800 and Korean company Genexine’s GX-I9, which was selected to receive government funding last month. Both are undergoing Phase 1 clinical trials. No vaccine has been approved for emergency use.                           ━   Global competition            In terms of procedural advancement, Korean companies fall behind their global competitors in the Covid-19 race.           U.S. pharmaceutical companies Regeneron and Eli Lilly are the front runners with Covid-19 treatment, both conducting Phase 3 clinical trials. Regeneron, in particular, is expecting to disclose test data at the end of this month.           In the vaccine segment, British bio firm AstraZeneca and Moderna and Pfizer — both headquartered in the United States — are conducting Phase 3 clinical trials.           Compared to these multinational firms that are pouring billions of dollars into the Covid-19 initiative, experts say Korean companies lack in resources and experience.           “With testing kits, local companies already had the production capacity and experience in development and exports. But that’s not the case with treatment or vaccines,” said Oh Ki-hwan, the industry policy division director at KoreaBIO, an advocate group for local biopharmaceutical firms.           “At the current stage, it’s hard to pinpoint the possibility of treatments or vaccines developed in Korea turning out to be a success. It’s a task where the stakes of failure are extremely high.”           But the uncertainty of success is not just an issue for Korean companies.           Vaccines normally take more than 10 years to be developed. In an unconventional move, governments around the world are fast-tracking approval, but no matter how much they speed up the process, clinical trials can go wrong — even for global players with huge amounts of money.            On Sept. 9, AstraZeneca halted its Phase 3 clinical trials worldwide in order to investigate a “potentially unexpected illness” that occurred in one of its trials.           Until that moment, the British company was thought to be the closest to releasing a Covid-19 vaccine. The very next day, AstraZeneca and eight other multinational pharmaceutical firms released a joint pledge that they will not rush vaccine development at the expense of safety and efficacy.           “The reason this incident caused such a huge stir in the market was because so many people overlooked the possibility of failure under the emergency state of a global pandemic. It’s time we brush off the impatience and excessive anticipation like expecting a Covid-19 vaccine this year,” said Sun Min-jeong, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment.                ━   Success will open doors            But even if Korea isn’t among the first countries to come up with a treatment or vaccine, this doesn’t mean the R&D efforts are not worth the time and money.           Experts say production facilities are insufficient to serve global demand even if a vaccine is developed in the near future. Until a time comes when everybody is vaccinated, treatments will be needed to cure patients.           “Because supply will be so limited, countries with buying power are already coming forward to secure batches ahead of others. Even if a treatment or vaccine is developed overseas, we can’t ensure it will be accessible to the Korean public,” said Jeong Chan-woong, who heads the PR and research unit at Korea Pharmaceutical and Bio-Pharma Manufacturers Association.             “That’s why we need local companies to have this technology. It’s a matter of public health and sovereignty in pharmaceutical supplies.”           Some analysts remain skeptical that Korea can succeed in developing a treatment or vaccine at all. Even in this worst-case scenario, Korea’s production capacity could create opportunities in contract manufacturing.           SK Bioscience, for example, has signed production contracts with AstraZeneca and another U.S. biopharmaceutical company Novavax to produce their Covid-19 antibody treatments after authorization. Samsung Biologics also closed a 439.3 billion won ($374.2 million) contract to mass-produce British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)’s Covid-19 treatments.             “At first, Covid-19 vaccines were thought to be a one-time revenue source. Now, there’s anticipation that they will be a sustainable revenue source like seasonal flu,” said a KTB Investment report released Sept. 2.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

292,"[NEWS IN FOCUS] Spotify is still almost here, and seems to be getting closer","

      A smartphone is seen in front of a screen projection of Spotify logo, in this picture illustration taken April 1, 2018. [REUTERS]         Spotify, the world's largest music streaming service, has long been rumored to be coming to Korea, one of the few major markets where it is not yet available. The rumors remain and are being supported by evidence of an imminent arrival.           In particular, the local subsidiary of the Swedish company has increased its capital by a significant amount.           Other indicators have been noted. Spotify Korea accounts were opened on Twitter and Instagram last month, although no postings have been made as of yet. The international platform, which is not visible locally, can now be viewed in hangul.             Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek has said the company wants to operate in Korea, but no date has been set. Spotify Korea declined to comment.           The company opened an office in Gangnam, southern Seoul, in January, and Peter Grandelius, head of legal at Spotify, is registered as the head of the branch.           The Korean unit started off with 900 million won ($776,000) in capital but increased it to 5.8 billion won earlier this month, according to media reports. It appointed directors and an auditor.           Despite the progress, licensing remains an issue for the streaming company. Music streaming service providers must make agreements with groups to determine the scope of music provided and compensation.           The Korea Music Copyright Association is currently in discussions with Spotify but would not comment. The Federation of Korean Music Performers and Recording Industry Association of Korea also acknowledged that they are in discussions with Spotify but declined to comment.             The negotiation with those groups and major music distribution companies is considered as the key for music streaming operators, since the failure could lead to limited offerings of music performed by Korean artists.             Apple Music started in Korea in 2016 but failed to take off due primarily to lack of Korean music offerings compared to domestic streaming services like Melon and Genie Music.             Spotify has 299 million users, including 138 million paid subscribers, across 92 markets.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
293,Korea records first-ever half-year surplus in culture and arts copyrights,"

     Korea recorded the first-ever half-year surplus in the trade of culture and arts copyrights, thanks to the global popularity of K-pop bands such as BTS, left, and of films including the Oscar-winning ’Parasite,“ right, the Culture Ministry said on Sunday. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT, YONHAP]               Korea recorded the first-ever half-year surplus in the trade of culture and arts copyrights, thanks to the global popularity of K-pop bands such as BTS and of films including the Cannes Palme D’Ore- and Oscar-winning “Parasite” (2019) directed by Bong Joon-ho, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said on Sunday.            The total copyrights trade balance, including for software, research and development (R&D) as well as for culture and arts, marked the record high surplus of $1.04 billion in the first six months of 2020, the ministry said, quoting an intellectual property rights (IPR) trade report released by the Bank of Korea on Friday.            Although the total IPR trades including those of industrial property rights marked a deficit of $750 million in the first half, the copyright trade surplus increased by $300 million year-on-year to the record high. The software and R&D copyrights trade surplus including for games and databases reached $967.8 million in the black. Culture and arts copyrights including those for music, TV series, films, visual art and literature, represented a $75.8 million surplus.           “This is the first time that culture and art copyrights balance marked a half-year surplus since the authorities began to compile the related data in 2010,” the Culture Ministry said in a press release. “In particular, the music and video [films and animations] copyrights showed a remarkable growth, seemingly helped by the global popularity of K-pop led by the band BTS and of the film ‘Parasite.'”             “The trade of culture and art copyrights marked a surplus despite concerns about the deterioration of trade balances due to the Covid19 pandemic,” Culture Minister Park Yang-woo said. “This means the competence of Korean culture and arts have been globally recognized.”           BY MOON SO-YOUNG   [symoon@joongang.co.kr]   "

[YONHAP]               The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) has asked Japan to ease border restrictions for businesspeople, hoping that the appointment of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will help to repair the two countries' business relations.         Huh Chang-soo, chief of FKI, sent a congratulatory letter to Suga on Friday, the FKI announced Sunday. In the letter, Huh asked that border restrictions are relaxed as the business community in both countries struggles because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.          “On behalf of the Korean business community, I would like to congratulate you on your inauguration as prime minister of Japan,” wrote Huh in the letter. “The international community is battling an unprecedented crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic. I have no doubt that you will be able to overcome these great challenges.”           Huh said relations between Korea and Japan has soured due to “different perspectives on history,” and Covid-19, which has limited interpersonal exchanges, created a further rift between the two countries.           ""As businesspeople are unable to cross each other’s borders, economic cooperation has also declined,” Huh added. “It is fervent wish of the Korean business community that your assumption of the high office will provide momentum to resolve these conflicts and breathe new and future-oriented life into the bilateral relationship and economic cooperation between Korea and Japan. We would like to ask for your unfettered support to lifting Covid-19 related mutual travel restriction in order to facilitate exchange, thereby expanding bilateral trade     and investment.”           Huh’s letter was delivered several days after Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong met Koji Tomita, Japanese ambassador to Korea, on Sept. 10. Details of the two’s discussion were not made public, but Lee reportedly also appealed against the border restrictions.           They are also known to have discussed ways business cooperation could be improved between the two neighboring countries.           Japan tightened border restrictions in April with the intention of limiting imported Covid-19 cases.           Some restrictions have started to be relaxed, but not between the two countries.           With Singapore, Japan has agreed to open borders for short-term business travelers starting this month.

298,"[TURNING 20] In a sea of hate, change flourishes","

     The 2019 Seoul Queer Culture Festival on June 1, held at the City Hall Plaza in central Seoul. [YONHAP]             TURNING 20 SEVENTH IN A SERIES        The Korea JoongAng Daily is turning 20 this year and to celebrate we will be bringing you 20 coming-of-age stories whose subjects range from people to animals to organizations, all of which have also turned 20.           It started with 50 people parading down the streets of western Seoul’s Hongdae among an indifferent crowd. Twenty years have passed, and the Queer Parade and the Seoul Queer Culture Festival has become one of the biggest — and certainly the most debated — annual festivals to take place every summer in Korea. Last year's event recorded over 80,000 attendants.           Korea remains a hostile land for sexual minorities in 2020, but the queer festival has paraded through 20 years of hardship, spreading love and pride with its rainbow flags. This year marks the festival’s 20th anniversary, and, as always, it’s all about raising awareness and bringing change to society. The queer festival, as well as the Korea Queer Film Festival, begin on Sept. 18 with the opening ceremony and take place until Sept. 29, all online. The slogan is “Further, Closer,” hoping people will feel closer to each other even if they remain physically distant during the pandemic.             Despite all the years of struggle, this year has been a particularly difficult one especially due to the coronavirus. Not only was the gay community bombarded with articles and hate messages earlier this year when a cluster of infections broke out from a gay club in central Seoul’s Itaewon neighborhood in May, the virus has forced the festival to hold its event online for the first time — but technical difficulties are the least of the worries on the minds of the organizing committee.           Whereas other events that go online seem to be able to find safety in the digital space, haters keep the queer festival organizers even more alert, according to Yang Sun-woo, who also goes by the nickname Hollic, chairperson of the Seoul Queer Culture Festival Organizing Committee this year.              Yang Sun-woo, chairperson of the Seoul Queer Culture Festival Organizing Committee this year, sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily prior to the opening of the festival on Sept. 18, sharing thoughts on the festival's 20th anniversary this year. [JEON TAE-GYU]               “A lot of things have changed since we decided to hold the event online, and we’re keeping ourselves extremely busy preparing for something we’ve never done before,” said Yang. “But a thing that we have to keep in mind, which won’t be the case for other online festivals, is that we’re worried that people who don’t like us will cause a scene. There have been cases in the past where they bombard our online events and shut us down completely, and they keep track of all our moves. Even the online space isn’t safe for us.""           Aside from the usual round of hate messages they get every summer in tandem with the queer festival — which usually takes place around June, to coincide with other pride parades around the world — two incidents put the LGBTQ community in the spotlight this year: one in February when a transgender student was reported to have been admitted to Sookmyung Women’s University but dropped out due to opposition, and one in May when a patient who tested positive for the coronavirus was found to have visited gay clubs in Itaewon.           Both incidents garnered massive attacks not only by the conservative public, but also by the media which used homophobic vocabulary to describe the clubs and reported unrelated stories to reveal “the secret gay hideouts.” Even for the Sookmyung student, who had undergone gender reassignment both physically and legally — she was forced to drop out after myriads of reports and posters were erected on the school grounds that said her presence was “putting the school in danger.”              A billboard put up by civil organization Rainbow Action Against Sexual Minority Discrimination to celebrate the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia (Idahobit) inside Sinchon subway station, Line 2, was damaged five times during its monthlong publication from Aug. 1 to Aug. 31. [YONHAP]               In August a billboard put up by civil organization Rainbow Action Against Sexual Minority Discrimination to celebrate the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia (Idahobit) inside Sinchon subway station, Line 2, was damaged five times during its monthlong installation from Aug. 1 to Aug. 31. The billboard was put up as a project co-held with the National Human Rights Commission and carried the message, “Sexual minorities are there in your lives” urging people to stop hate toward sexual minorities, but was instead faced with more direct actions of hostility. Two suspects were identified by the police, one of whom is suspected to have damaged the billboard three times.           “I think just overall, Korea lacks generosity,” said Yang. “To live in Korea means to face that in all parts of the society. The billboard damaged in Sinchon isn’t really the first time it’s happened to us — it’s been done to our manifestation from years ago. When we hang up rainbow flags or placards to welcome sexual minorities in universities, or just anywhere that we show ourselves, we’re faced with hatred. There was even a time during our parade in Daegu where a man threw feces at us. He was an elder at a Christian church.           “But with the Sinchon billboard and everything else, there are so many people who show support. Activists stayed up around the billboard for three days to make sure no one harmed it again, and passersby told them to cheer up and even gave them flowers. I think the general public knows that sexual minorities live together among them. People are changing and ideas are changing, even if the hateful voices shown through the media seem to be louder. The hate goes on, but there is change within all that.”           Yang sat down with the Korea JoongAng Daily prior to the opening of the festival, to talk about the change over the years and hope for more to come for Korea. The following are edited excerpts of the interview where she talked about love, pride and the festival.              Yang Sun-woo, chairperson of the Seoul Queer Culture Festival Organizing Committee this year, sits down for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily prior to the opening of the festival on Sept. 18, sharing thoughts on the festival's 20th anniversary this year. [JEON TAE-GYU]                   Q. You have been appointed as the chairperson of the Seoul Queer Culture Festival Organizing Committee in a year when the event will be going online for the first time. Are you worried about how it will turn out?       A. It does definitely feel burdensome. I was worried about how to keep it safe during the coronavirus, and it grew even more as the date kept getting pushed. And also about the opposition, because we always know they’re there.All the pride parades in other countries around the world have also gone online, where they stream their own parades or have congratulatory videos filmed and sent for them to broadcast. I’m less worried about the film festival, but we’re still working out how to re-enact the promotional booths in the online space. We know that the offline events and booths are the things that keep people engaged, and that’s even amplified when they see that other people feel the same way too. It’s not going to be the same online, and that’s the part we’re working very hard on.             Q. What do you think will be the most different when the festival takes place online?       A. We invite a lot of films from outside of Korea. We actually had all the films ready, but because many of the distributors were based in the United States, we just couldn’t get in touch with them after the coronavirus pandemic. So we’ve just decided to focus on the local films. That’s halved the number of the films that we wanted to play.The biggest downside of opening the festival online is that every year with the festival and the parade, people come and attend and get one day where they can truly be themselves. They look forward to that freedom and sharing that with other people, but it’s not going to be same online. We’re going to broadcast the programs, but that’s not the same as experiencing it in person. Plus, we’re worried that people who dislike us will come and try to sabotage everything. Safety is important to everyone, but it’s a word that bears so much more meaning for sexual minorities.            Pedestrians walk by a billboard put up by civil organization Rainbow Action Against Sexual Minority Discrimination to celebrate the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia (Idahobit) inside Sinchon subway station, Line 2 on Aug. 4. [NEWS1]             Q. The antidiscrimination billboard hung up at Sinchon was damaged multiple times. How did you feel about that?       A. The billboard at Sinchon station carried a very plain message, that sexual minorities are there with you in your ordinary lives. But I guess even that seemed like a threat to some people, since they cut it with knives or spray painted over it. They’re being honest, but there is a difference between disliking sexual minorities and expressing that. When they break something or threaten someone, then they’re committing a hate crime, but I don’t think people realize that.But a lot of people now do realize that there are sexual minorities there with everyone else. Whenever I go to give talks, I ask the question whether those in attendance know anyone in the LGBTQ community. In the past, not many people said yes, because we were indeed invisible in society. But now, I get replies that they know at least one or two people around them. Society is changing. It’s just that hate speaks louder.             Q. How did you feel about the discriminatory reports that came out because of the Itaewon cluster of infections?       A. I think the coronavirus crisis has actually exposed things that society wanted to hide in the past — the problems we have in our society and our awareness toward them. Over a thousand reports poured out from the media because of the Itaewon club case, and they all used the phrase “gay club infection” and identified anyone who caught the virus from the club as gay. Their sexuality has nothing to do with the fact that they were infected, but the reports emphasized that side of the story that was unrelated to the actual infections. No one blamed Christianity as a whole when infection clusters came from churches. I think it shows just how society treats its minorities.             Q. A transgender student dropped out of Sookmyung Women’s University and a soldier was forcibly discharged from the army after a sex reassignment surgery, both earlier this year. What did you think of these two instances?       A. Coming out in Korea is not easy. Both cases are instances of rejection by society. For Byun [the soldier], she obviously had support from the people that surrounded her, but Korean society did not. There are ways of serving in the army without being discharged, but our society just didn’t have the right discussion about the situation.And even for the student, she had already undergone procedures to legally change her gender, but the walls of the schools were covered with posters calling her out — this one person, one student. People assumed that she will be a threat to the school, and she had to witness words of threat and hate that were all targeted toward her. They would have looked for her and tried to find out who she was, which made her feel threatened and eventually forced her to drop out.People say that discrimination against sexual minorities is wrong, but there are still so many cases where we are pushed aside, denied and rejected in the society. Hate isn’t an opinion. It really doesn’t need a consensus.            The poster image for this year's Seoul Queer Culture Festival. [SEOUL QUEER CULTURE FESTIVAL]             Q. Korea still lacks an antidiscrimination law, but do you think it will eventually pass the National Assembly?       A. It’s true that there are no laws or policies regarding minorities — not just sexual minorities. The United Nations has recommended Korea passes a law regarding minorities and antidiscrimination, but it’s not happening. But I do think that it will be passed. Politicians have promised to do so, even since the Roh Moo-hyun administration in 2003. And a positive side is that there are representatives at the National Assembly that are active about protecting minorities and human rights. We’ve never had anyone like that in the past. I think things are looking hopeful.The antidiscrimination law is so misunderstood. Conservative Christians spread the word that they won’t be able to preach at all at churches or that they will be punished for saying things. But the antidiscrimination law is nothing like that. It’s about protecting minorities being penalized or discriminated against in the public sphere — like when they’re getting jobs or being victimized due to their sexuality.Even if the law is passed, it won’t drastically change the lives of sexual minorities in Korea. For instance, say the government allowed same-sex marriage. Do you think that homosexuals from all over society will pour out and start getting married? No, that can’t happen in Korea. The law doesn’t immediately change society, but at least it will be one step of progress from the zero number of laws that we have right now.             Q. Would you say that Korea has changed over the years?       A. People’s awareness has definitely changed. People know that it’s not right to deny the existence of sexual minorities. Even the opposition is a symbol of the fact that they know we’re here. And I think the tougher the hateful opposition, the more people think, “Are they right to act like that?” People were indifferent toward sexual minorities in the past, even though they oppose us now. But it’s not just sexual minorities — it’s all the minorities, including refugees and people with disabilities. Everything is connected, and I think we’re beginning to think about discrimination in general, even though the activists are quite dispersed.I think the coronavirus has actually taught people that they could all be discriminated against. It could be a lesson we’ve learned from this pandemic. But I think Korea is just a tough place to live in. We have the highest suicide rate and everyone is scared of becoming the minority. It’s hard to say that something is right even when it is actually right. It’s oppressive, and we’re not allowed to talk about so many things.         BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
299,Korea's plan to sell India 3 trillion won worth of weapons on the rocks ,"

     The K30 Biho anti-aircraft system. [HANWHA DEFENSE]               The Korean defense industry’s ambitious plan to sell 3 trillion won ($2.6 billion) worth of anti-aircraft artillery to India is on life support, with reports suggesting New Delhi may build the weapons on its own.           According to the Indian media outlet ThePrint on Thursday, the Indian Defense Ministry agreed in a meeting between top officials to scrap plans to overhaul its self propelled air defense gun missile system (SPAD-GMS) through foreign acquisitions, and instead manufacture the weapons domestically.           According to another Indian outlet, Financial Express, the decision was made to ensure the Indian Armed Forces’ dependency on imports was cut down, amid fierce competition between Korean arms maker Hanwha Defense and its Russian competitor to win the SPAD-GMS contract.            The decision threatens to undo over seven years of concerted efforts by the Korean government and Hanwha to export the K30 Biho, one of Korea’s most successful domestic weapons projects to date. The Biho is a short-range anti-aircraft artillery capable of shooting down enemy planes and drones at low altitudes, and is further bolstered by a short-range antimissile system.           Developed in 2013 and operationally deployed since 2015, the system was paired with the surface-to-air Chiron missile developed by the Korean aerospace manufacturer LIG Nex1 known as Shingoong.             The Indian military began a bidding process for SPAD-GMS in 2013 to bolster areas along its border with Pakistan where five brigades are stationed. Candidate weapons were evaluated throughout 2015 and tested in 2017.           The Korean defense industry was eyeing the Indian market as a chance to move away from domestic sales to exports. The contract involves exporting 104 Biho systems, 97 ammunition carriers, 39 command vehicles, 4,928 missiles and 172,260 rounds of ammunition, bringing the contract’s total value to between 2.5 trillion won and 3 trillion won.           The bid looked promising for Korea by October 2018, when India selected the K30 as the sole bidder for price negotiations after the system won out in a testing phase against the Russian-made Tunguska M1 and Pantsir missile systems.             Moscow, however, a traditional supplier of arms to New Delhi, undertook a concerted campaign to stop the bid, openly requesting the Indian Defense Ministry to re-evaluate the process. Given India’s heavy reliance on Russian weapons, New Delhi found it difficult to sidestep pressure from Moscow lest it endanger future arms negotiations.             The decision to manufacture SPAD-GMS locally, if true, appears to be an attempt by India to placate Russia while keeping to its plans to reduce overt dependence on Russian arms.             Seoul, however, has been taken aback by the Indian military’s alleged decision, alarmed that its high profile attempts to sell the K30 may have been in vain.           In September last year, the Korean government invited Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh as the sole minister-level guest to the Seoul Defense Dialogue, an annual security forum. Singh also met with Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon during that visit.              Former Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, left, speaks to Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh at last year's Seoul Defense Dialogue. [JANG JIN-YOUNG]               Korea’s former Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, who was replaced by Gen. Suh Wook last week, also took part in DefExpo 2020, a biennial defense exhibition hosted by the Indian Defense Ministry, in February to help promote the Biho in India, the world’s second largest arms importer.             “We have yet to receive an official communication from the Indian government,” said one Korean defense industry insider. “We are awaiting the results, since the Biho was the only system that satisfied the performance requirements set by India, and agreements were reached between both countries’ ministers.”           BY LEE KEUN-PYUNG, SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
300,House-bound consumers awaken a sleeping industry,"

     Customers shop for furniture at Hyundai Department Store in Guro District, western Seoul, on Sept. 15. Koreans have begun investing heavily in sleep-related products as Covid-19 leaves them spending more time at home. [YONHAP]         As social distancing grinds on and people spend more time at home, Koreans are increasingly investing in a good night’s sleep.           The consumption trend is sometimes described as “sleeponomics.”           According to e-commerce site Gmarket, sales of sleep-related products spiked by up to 70 percent between March and August.           “Due to people’s changing consumer patterns and high level of stress, we've seen products that are helpful to improve quality of sleep gain popularity,” the company said.           The industry had seen some growth before the Covid-19 outbreak, according to the Korea Sleep Industry Association, with market value jumping from 2 trillion won ($1.7 billion) in 2015 to 3 trillion won last year. But that trend was dramatically accelerated by the pandemic.           A few years ago, the top-selling items in the genre were candles, black-out curtains and thick cotton blankets. Now consumers are turning their eyes to more fundamental — and more expensive — equipment, including costly pillows and beds. And those investments come with a focus on health and safety amid the pandemic.           Bang Ji-won, a woman in her 30s, recently upgraded the pillows and bedding at her house to include more costly products.           ""We wear pajamas in bed, but still these are items that are in direct contact with our skin,” Bang said. “I thought it'd be better to buy a more expensive product; it ensures better safety.”           Demand for costly latex pillows and memory foam pillows has been sharply growing.           Gmarket’s sales of latex pillows increased by 13 percent this year compared to a year earlier, while sales of normal pillows decreased by 9 percent. Sales of memory foam pillows from Denmark-based bedding provider Tempur also jumped by 30 percent this year compared to a year before. The growing interest in pillows also follows growing concerns with posture as office workers spend hours with their necks craned forward, attached to their digital devices.           “The sales increased nearly fivefold compared to 2012 when Tempur products were first introduced in Korea,” said Kim Sae-am, the head of Tempur's local marketing team. “We see significantly strong demand for pillows that are specifically designed to offer relief to the neck.""           Another global mattress maker, Simmons, developed pillows using the same spring technology used on its mattresses.           And motion beds, or motorized bed frames that can elevate the head and bottom sections of a mattress, are particularly popular among customers who enjoy reading books, watching movies and using smartphones and tablets in their beds.           “Furniture companies have been enjoying an unexpected demand boom from Covid-19 government relief. Products that are made with a focus on offering physical relief are especially popular,” said a spokesperson for local furniture company Emons. “Many customers these days purchase motion beds, which in the past were not that popular due to the expensive price tag.”           As part of efforts to attract more customers, bedding companies are scrambling to introduce even better, more luxurious items.           In August, Tempur launched a motion bed, Lykke, which comes with Bang & Olufsen’s first sound bar, Beosound Stage. The fabric covering the bed frame is made of 100 percent pure wool and costs 10 million won to 12 million won.           Companies have also come up with unique functions for their motion beds. Emons introduced a motion bed that includes a sensor in the mattress to monitor users’ sleeping patterns and biological markers like heart rate and breathing, along with whether the user is tossing and turning in their sleep. And if the user falls asleep while watching television or reading a book with the frame tilted, the bed can automatically adjust itself to be flat again using the changes in the bio markers.             BY YOON KYUNG-HEE   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
301,Seoul voices 'deep regret' over Abe's visit to Yasukuni Shrine,"

     This image, captured from former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Twitter account on Saturday, shows him visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. [YONHAP]               Korea voiced ""deep concern and regret"" after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo on Saturday visited a war shrine seen as a symbol of Japan's past militarism.            Abe said in a tweet that he visited Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo and reported his resignation to the war dead. Abe ended his nearly eight-year tenure in office earlier this week due to health problems.           ""We express deep concern and regret that former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Yasukuni Shrine, a symbolic establishment that beautifies Japan's colonial plunder and war of aggression, right after his resignation,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Kim In-chul said.           ""The government once again sternly points out that the neighboring countries and international community can trust Japan only when Japanese leaders face history squarely and show by action they humbly reflect on and genuinely atone for the past history,"" he added.           This was Abe's first visit to the shrine in nearly seven years. He did not visit the shrine as prime minister after his last visit in 2013 sparked criticism.           Yasukuni Shrine honors Japan's war dead, including 14 Class A war criminals.           Visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have been a key source of tension in the region as Asian neighbors view the visits as an attempt to beautify the country's militaristic past.           Instead of visiting the shrine, Abe had sent offerings around key festivals and on Aug. 15, the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, which also angered neighboring countries, like Korea and China, that suffered Japanese aggression in the early to mid-20th century.           Yonhap   "

                   LG U+ will partner with Google to collaborate on mobile edge computing (MEC), a technique that brings computation and data storage closer to the devices being used to reduce latency on 5G networks.           The mobile carrier announced Sunday that the agreement is directed toward upgrading the technology, establishing an ecosystem for it and supported applications.           The set of initiatives will be built upon LG U+’s 5G network while Google Cloud will be used to offer advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning and platforms including Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating computer application deployment.            The telecom operator has been keen on deploying MEC in different situations as shown in a recent test transmitting a live video feed from a vehicle to the car behind it to prevent accidents.           Rival telecom companies are ramping up development of MEC through partnerships.           SK Telecom will provide a mobile edge cloud service built upon 5G wireless technology within the year in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS).           KT has joined an alliance with global telecom companies — Verizon of the United States, Britain’s Vodafone, Canada’s Roger’s, Mexico’s America Movil and Australia’s Telstra — to co-develop technology and standards for MEC.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
303,Defector arrested attempting to cross border back into North Korea,"

                  A defector was arrested for attempting to cross back into North Korea through a border military unit in Cheorwon County in Gangwon earlier in the week, South Korean police said Sunday.             The man in his 30s was caught entering the South Korean Army’s 3rd Infantry Division’s tank battalion training field in Cheorwon at around 9 a.m. Thursday in an attempt to cross the inter-Korean border.             He had four mobile phones and a wire cutter in his possession at the time he was caught by soldiers. The man was not able to properly explain why he had entered the unit when he was initially caught, according to military officials at the time.             The Army turned the man over to police because he was a civilian.           Police said that the man was taken into custody and is currently undergoing investigation for violating the National Security Law by trying to cross to the North without authorization.             The man, originally from the North Korean army, defected to the South in 2018 and has resided in Seoul since then.           The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency will question him to find out why he tried to return to the North and the details of how he was planning to cross the border before turning him over the prosecutors.           In July, North Korean state media reported that a defector suspected of having coronavirus symptoms crossed the military demarcation line to return to his home country.           The Unification Ministry confirmed in late July that 11 North Korean defectors had returned to their homeland in the past three years: three in 2015, four in 2016 and four in 2017.

304,General Suh Wook sworn in as new defense minister,"

     President Moon Jae-in, right, hands an appointment letter to Defense Minister Suh Wook on Friday. [BLUE HOUSE]               General Suh Wook was sworn in as Korea’s Minister of National Defense on Saturday, making him the first Army commander to head the country’s defense in the Moon Jae-in administration.           Suh, 58, was Army chief of staff before he was tapped by Moon to succeed outgoing minister Jeong Kyeong-doo last month.           Known for his keen strategic mindset, Suh was widely regarded as the best figure to successfully see through the transfer of wartime operational control (Opcon) back to Korea from the United States, a process that is envisioned to be completed around 2022.           That expectation was reflected in Suh’s acceptance speech delivered at his appointment ceremony Saturday, in which he pledged to expedite Opcon transfer on the basis of a firm alliance with the United States.           “I will ensure transfer conditions are met ahead of schedule on the basis of a precise assessment of the abilities our forces have built over time, including the military’s key combat abilities, for the realization of responsible national defense,” Suh said.           Along with Suh’s appointment, Moon nominated Air Force Chief of Staff Won In-choul as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), making him the third-ever Air Force officer to be appointed to Korea's highest military office.           The two choices were surprising, given that Won belongs to the Air Force Academy’s class of 1980, making him a year older than defense minister nominee Suh, who entered the Korea Military Academy (KMA) in 1981.           Traditionally, a defense minister is more senior than the chairman of the JCS, and it is rare in the Korean military that a figure from a junior class is appointed above an older officer.           Analysts think the pair’s nomination represents an attempt by the Blue House to check the influence of the KMA, which has long dominated top positions in the military and wielded undue sway over politics even after the end of the military junta, which was almost entirely composed of KMA graduates.           Won is expected to be appointed JCS chairman on Monday, as the National Assembly has already confirmed his nomination.           Suh’s first task as defense chief will be to oversee discussions with the United States over Opcon transfer at the Korea-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting slated for November.           But whether Opcon transfer can take place as hoped by the administration within Moon’s term until 2022 remains in doubt.           The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly delayed the timetable for assessments of the Korean military’s ability to assume command of allied forces, namely with the scaling down of joint command post exercises last month.           The bigger impediment, however, may be the ongoing strategic concerns underpinning U.S. security policy in Northeast Asia.             China’s growing military clout and muscle flexing in the region has put the United States on edge, pushing security planners in Washington to enlist key allies in the region, like Korea, in an envisioned multilateral coalition to contain Beijing.           Seoul has reportedly been invited to join an expanded form of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a security forum composed of the United States, Japan, Australia and India, better known as Quad, but Korea has been reluctant to commit further due to its close economic ties to China.           Amid such tensions, talks are reportedly being held in the Pentagon over changing the character of the permanent U.S. military presence in places like Korea into something more rotational — an adjustment that would inevitably spell major changes to the allies’ plan for Opcon transfer in the near future.           “Opcon transfer can happen immediately if the United States decides so, but it is unlikely it will hand over command to the Korean military amid growing tensions with China,” said one military source. “This may be a challenge that Suh finds hard to resolve.”           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK, KIM SANG-JIN   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
305,DP expels Kim Dae-jung's son amid real estate scandal,"

     Democratic Party Rep. Kim Hong-gul is seated at the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, last Wednesday. The DP decided to expel Kim from the party Friday amid allegations that he had underreported property ownership. [YONHAP]               Rep. Kim Hong-gul, the son of late President Kim Dae-jung, has been expelled from the ruling Democratic Party (DP) over allegations he underreported property ownership and real estate speculation.           The DP Supreme Council in an emergency meeting on Friday reached a decision to expel Kim after the party’s ethics inspection body looked into allegations that the first-term proportional representative lawmaker had falsely reported property ownership and violated election law.           The party’s ethics committee on Wednesday launched an investigative body headed by DP Rep. Choi Ki-sang to probe various accusations raised against some of its lawmakers, including Kim.           Choi In-ho, a DP spokesman, said Friday the ethics inspection body requested the expulsion of Kim because he “did not sincerely cooperate with the inspectors and damaged the party’s dignity by possessing multiple properties, which is a departure from the essence of the party’s real estate policy.”           Kim owns four homes, including the residence of his late father in Donggyo-dong, western Seoul, but only declared three to the National Election Commission (NEC) ahead of the April 15 general elections, apparently omitting his Godeok-dong apartment in Gangdong District, eastern Seoul, reportedly worth over 1 billion won ($860,000).           Kim denied the allegations raised against him, saying he does not manage the wealth himself and that his wife had purchased the ownership rights to the Godeok-dong apartment.           In a statement released through his office Saturday, Kim said he takes the party’s decision to expel him with a “heavy and solemn heart,” adding he is sorry for “causing concern to the people and causing a burden for the party.”           However, Kim denied that he had been uncooperative with the inspection body and stressed, “I want to make it clear that I did not evade or refuse to cooperate with the investigation and inspection.”           The decision to expel Kim from the party that was established by his father came just two days into the probe, and seems to be an attempt at early damage control. It also is seen to reflect DP Chairman’s Lee Nak-yon’s intent for the party to strongly adhere to reform measures including its real estate policies.           DP Rep. Kim Han-jung, a former press secretary and senior aide to the late Kim Dae-jung who accompanied the former president to the first inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang in 2000, in a Facebook post Friday morning ahead of the ethics committee meeting appeared to allude to Kim Hong-gul’s upcoming expulsion.           “There is no acceptable explanation for purchasing multiple homes,” he wrote, calling on the party to reach a speedy decision.           He added, “The most worrying thing is that many people who respected and followed [former] President Kim Dae-jung and First Lady Lee Hee-ho will be disappointed and resentful. This is not a passing shower that can be avoided by waiting it out.”             Kim, the third and youngest son of the former president, joined the DP in 2016.           However, as a proportional representative lawmaker, Kim can continue to maintain his seat in the National Assembly even after being expelled from the party in accordance with the Public Official Election Act.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

[PARK SANG-MOON]         A plaque to honor the sacrifices made by the United States Military Academy (USMA) class of 1948 in the 1950-53 Korean War was unveiled last Friday at the Korea Military Academy (KMA) in Nowon District, northern Seoul.           It was the third memorial plaque for USMA graduates installed near the KMA’s Memorial Tower, all in remembrance of the lost lives during the war. Plaques for the USMA classes of 1949 and 1950 were previously unveiled, and the KMA said it plans to install three more by 2023 for the USMA classes of 1946, 1947 and 1951.           The KMA said in a statement that the area will become a memorial park to pay respect to the USMA graduates who fought in the Korean War to “protect the freedom and peace of the Republic of Korea [ROK],” and to highlight the importance of the ROK-U.S. alliance.           Among 301 graduates of the USMA class of 1948, 103 fought in the war and 17 lost their lives. All 17 names were inscribed on the plaque revealed last Friday during a ceremony hosted by the KMA and sponsored by the Korea Defense Veterans Association (KDVA), which contributed 3 million won ($2,600) for the plaque.           The ceremony was participated in by Lt. Gen. Chung Jin-kyung, superintendent of the KMA; Maj. Gen. Steve Gilland, commanding general of the 2nd Infantry Division/ROK-U.S. Combined Division; Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Lee Seo-young, president of the KDVA-Korea Chapter; Gen. (Ret.) Kwon Oh-sung, honorary president of the KDVA-Korea Chapter; Brig. Gen. Shin Sang-bum, head of the Commemorative Task Force for the 70th Anniversary of the Korean War at the Ministry of National Defense; and Kim Ju-yong, director general for international cooperation and of the 70th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration Office at the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.           “The values of freedom and peace that these men [of the USMA class of 1948] tried to protect have made the Republic of Korea what it is today, and were the foundation of the world’s strongest ROK-U.S. alliance,” said Chung.           By forming a memorial park for fallen USMA soldiers on the university campus, Chung continued that he looks forward to honoring the “West Point heroes” and teaching the importance of the alliance to KMA cadets and the general public.           “This memorial is a reminder of all the soldiers that made the ultimate sacrifice from the United States, Korea and the other 21 nations that fought in the defense of the Korean Peninsula,” said Gilland. “For we not honor just the soldiers, not just the graduates of the military academy, but also the families and all of those who experienced hardships of war both at home and abroad.”           Gilland continued that with this year being the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, the occasion “commemorates the early foundations of the ROK-U.S. alliance, which has only grown stronger through the decades.”           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

309,Seoul's pastry scene offers classic styles and new twists,"

                  You can rely on a bite of something sweet when stressed, especially during the pandemic, when visits to restaurants and cafes are limited. Small pastry shops all across Seoul may give you the lift you need, or at least a sugar high.           With more culinary talent entering the restaurant industry, the scene is more diverse than ever. The pastry chefs who have honed their skills at big-name restaurants plating sweets for the end of a meal are now venturing out to establish the new dessert scene in Korea. Pastry shops have tended to have many seats for customers to come in and lounge, but newer shops are focusing more on bites than drinks, and many encourage takeout orders instead of providing seating.           Breaking with the common notion that dessert shops carry whole-size cakes, they also mostly only do small gateaux, unless customers place an order a few days in advance.           Many pastry chefs have returned from studying or working overseas over the past couple years. Given that there are still many desserts that are internationally popular yet less prevalent in Korea, many of these pastry chefs who own their own shops also teach classes either at their shop or at larger facilities.           Get your spoonful of sugar and forget your worries, at least temporarily.          Cedrat       [CEDRAT INSTAGRAM]         A bakery that serves French pastry.

You can order any drink that’s listed on the menu or go for the suggested pairing. Here, you can order premade desserts like cakes or macarons but also order plated desserts that are put together as you order. While the majority of the dishes are sweeter, the shop always has a couple of more savory options, such as a tomato-based dessert or one that tastes like carbonara. While it doesn’t have any showcase for whole cakes, the patisserie does take orders in advance.           Yongsan District, central Seoul     Instagram: jldessertbar               Patisserie Jaein       [JAEIN INSTAGRAM]         Probably one of the best-known dessert spots in western Seoul, where there is almost always a line of people out the door — as much as 30 minutes ahead of its 12:30 p.m. opening. Desserts sell out fast, so make sure to check either its Instagram or call before a visit. The shop uses seasonal items, like figs, to provide a range of flavors throughout the year. The pastry chef is continually searching for fruits and other ingredients that may have not been used much in dessert, such as odi (mulberry), in order to make visits to the shop worthwhile.           Seodamun District, western Seoul     Instagram: patisserie.jaein       Le Soleil    While other pastry shops do a little bit of many different types of desserts for diversity, this shop delves deep into simple baked goods like madeleines, financiers and some canelés. While many pastry shops only serve fruit-driven, or chocolate-covered desserts to accentuate the sweet side, this shop also branches out into more savory ingredients. One of its popular items is named Sun-dried, with sun-dried tomatoes, Gruyère cheese, cilantro and extra-virgin olive oil. It also uses many different grains including perilla seeds and sorghum.          Seodaemun District, western Seoul     Instagram: lesoleil_official               Quelquechose       [QUELQUECHOSE SEOUL INSTAGRAM]         What used to be called My Funny Dessert changed its name and location to focus on French pastries about a year ago.

If you go in the late afternoon, chances are you would only have a couple of macarons to choose from. Its macarons are more on the chewy side.

310,Online courses get failing grades from tech students,"

        University students were highly unsatisfied with courses that were held online over the spring semester due the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report.     That was one of the findings in a survey conducted by four engineering universities: KAIST, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (Dgist) and Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (Unist). The four schools questioned more than 1,000 students at the beginning and end of the spring semester.      At the beginning of the semester, the students were asked to rank their satisfaction level for online courses, and respondents gave a score of 5.2 out of 7. That score fell to 4.6 at the end of the semester. For courses that involved lab experiments, 43.4 percent of respondents said they were unsatisfied, and only 8.8 percent said they were satisfied.      Some 56.2 percent said the “absence of fellow students” was the biggest inconvenience. Online courses had removed their opportunity to build relations with their fellow students, respondents said.      Of all respondents, only 1.3 percent said they were able to make friends during the semester. Sixty-one percent said they felt anxiety, loneliness and depression because the courses were held online.     “As part of efforts to combat the coronavirus, it’s time to start considering people’s mental health as well,” the report concluded.     Others were unhappy about technical issues: 49.5 percent said “network connections” were a problem, while “server instability” troubled 43.5 percent. Multiple answers were allowed.      Poor concentration and an overload of assignments were other difficulties cited.     Asked whether holding classes online accelerated the learning process, students gave a score of 4.8 out of 7. They gave an even higher score of 5.3 when asked whether “online lectures gave more assignments and quizzes compared to offline courses.”      Students gave a score of 3.4 when asked if they were ""allowed to concentrate more on online lectures compared to offline."" They gave a 3.1 score to the statement, “Online lectures motivate me to study.”      The biggest dissatisfaction was with courses with lab experiments.      Forty-three percent of respondents said online lectures did not effectively replace lab experiments. A full 63.1 percent agreed that “courses that contain lab experiments cannot be held online.”       “Although online lectures are considered to be more convenient as they are free from space and time constraints, it turns out that online lectures cause poor interactions between students and are surely less effective than offline classes,” said Kim Hi-sam, a professor at GIST who directed the research.      Kim added that several issues need to be solved regarding online lectures including “strengthened communication between professors and students, acquiring better network connections […] and artificial intelligence-based personalized learning tools for individuals.”     BY PARK HYUNG-SOO   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]  "
311,Banks failed to tell borrowers they can demand rate cuts: FSS report,"

     People pass by the window of a bank's physical branch in Seoul. [YONHAP]               Korea's banks failed to inform customers of their rights to demand interest rate cuts, raising concerns that customers might be paying far more interest than they should be.           According to a recent report from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) submitted to a lawmaker from the People Power Party, 15 out of 16 local banks failed to properly inform their customers of such rights.             The report includes the results of a ""mystery shopping"" audit conducted by the FSS, which began last year and concluded in February. Financial regulators disguised as normal customers checked 16 local banks, 188 branches and call centers to see whether they were properly explaining customers' rights to request cuts to interest rates.             Scores are deducted from a maximum score of 100 points, with a point deducted each time a bank employee fails to accurately explain the customer’s right.             According to the report, all five commercial banks received scores of less than 70 points, which is the minimum score accepted by the FSS.           Hana Bank received the highest score, with 63.7 points. It was followed by Woori, with 52.4 points; KB Kookmin, with 49.5 points; Nonghyup, with 48.8 points; and Shinhan Bank, with 47.5 points. Financiers ranked under 60 are considered “poor” and those that scored between 60 to 70 points are considered “insufficient” under the FSS standards.             Customers who take out loans from banks have the right to ask them to lower their borrowing rates if their credit profile improves, whether due to promotions at work or a change in employment. Banks are responsible for informing customers of such rights. If a customer demands a rate cut, banks are obliged to internally review the request and notify the customer of the result within 10 business days.             While customers have had this right since 2002, it wasn't until June 2019 that a law was passed requiring banks to provide borrowers with that information. Savings banks, credit card companies and insurance companies are all affected by the law.           The state-run Industrial Bank of Korea received 58.8 points. One of Korea’s top internet-only banks, Kakao Bank, received 48 points. Six regional banks were well below average, scoring in the 40- to 45-point range. Among them, Jeju Bank, also a subsidiary of Shinhan Bank, scored the highest, with 45.3 points. The lowest was Busan Bank and Jeonbuk Bank of the North Jeolla region, each scoring 41.7 points and 40.8 points, respectively.             International banks scored even lower than their local counterparts, coming in at around 40 points. Citibank Korea scored 44.4 points, and Standard Chartered Banks Korea scored 40.6 points.             The FSS says it plans to inspect the quarterly performance results from 16 banks and request action plans to correct the issue.           In 2018, around 171,000 borrowers exercised such rights and successfully lowered their borrowing rates, collectively saving an annual 470 billion won ($405 million), according to data from the Financial Services Commission.           BY JEONG YONG-HWAN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
312,"Harassment reports now easier, less stressful, with app","

     ""Listen 2 Me,"" a mobile app intended to support victims of workplace sexual harassment, has been implemented by a number of public institutions since its release in May. [UCLICK]                Reporting cases of sexual harassment or verbal violence isn't easy for employees of state-owned corporations, which, compared to private companies, tend to have more conservative office cultures.           Two Korean start-ups have released a mobile app to offer a relief to this problem. At Listen 2 Me, employees can anonymously file a complaint to report problematic senior managers.           Kepco Plant Service & Engineering, Korea Western Power and Korea Minting, Security Printing & ID Card Operating have integrated the service into their organizations so far. In November, Koscom and Korea Midland Power will also start using the service.           Developed by IT start-up Connect X and operated by medium-sized software company Uclick, the essence of Listen 2 Me is in building a secret alliance among victims. Through the app, victims within a company who share a common offender can file a report together.           The record of the accuser and offender’s identity is encrypted and stored on the server. If another employee files a report against the same person, a notification is sent to the first accuser if he or she wants to report the offender together with someone else. The identity of each accuser is hidden for protection. It is also possible to file a report alone.           “Listen 2 Me focused on creating an environment that puts victims first,” said Park Seung-soo, director of Uclick. “If multiple victims report the same person, then companies are bound to come up with a response.”          The app provides guidelines for recounting and collecting details to prove the case. For example, when the user is asked to input information about where the act took place, the app suggests looking at credit card history if they do not have a clear memory. Phrases reassuring victims that they did not do anything wrong regularly pop up in between stages.           The app goes on to ask the user exactly how the offender acted after committing the violence and what measures the victim wants taken. This step is to minimize the face-to-face investigation that can potentially be stressful for the victims.           Another feature of the app is a checklist of items that may help the users identify the type of sexual harassment and abuse they experienced at the workplace. There are two sections, one for sexual harassment and the other for other types of abuse, including physical and psychological. The checklist for sexual harassment lists specific behavior, including conversations that involve sexually derogatory statements about the subject, stalking and forceful requests for meetings in private. In the section for general abuse, the list includes threats, use of slurs and violent language and bullying.           Human resources mangers have access to check the number of app downloads and the number of incidents being reported in real time. They are not able to single out the accuser and offender before a report is actually submitted. Before then, the app only informs the company that a report is in the process of being filled out — a measure that gives the company time to prepare for the worst.             In order to minimize misappropriation of the system, employee confirmation takes place at the beginning stage of filing a report to see whether the accuser actually works at the company. This is done by the accuser receiving a verification number to their corporate email account.           “Listen 2 Me is like a fire extinguisher placed at corners of buildings. It promptly represses a small fire and prevents a big one,” said Park. “Implementation itself will bring preventative advantages like hindering employees from abusing their coworkers.”           BY KIM JUNG-MIN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
313,Chuseok delivery strike canceled as headcount increased,"

     Delivery workers sort packages at a logistic center in Seoul. [NEWS1]                Delivery workers have canceled a threatened strike after logistics companies agreed to increase headcount for package sorting.           The group threatening the strike said in a statement Friday that it was positive on moves to hire more workers and the government's promise to monitor progress.           Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Union held a press conference Thursday saying that some 4,000 delivery workers will refuse to sort parcels on Sept. 21. The union members claimed they are not being fully compensated for work being done.           Delivery workers usually sort packages by destination at logistics terminals, which takes half the work day. Union members and nonmembers voted to walk out claiming that deaths from overwork have occurred.           In response, the Transport Ministry and the Labor Ministry held an emergency meeting with delivery workers on the day of the announcement and urged the hiring of 10,000 people for sorting tasks ahead of the Chuseok holidays.           “We demand logistics companies put their utmost effort to add more workers to sort parcels. The government should also thoroughly conduct daily inspections and on-site guidance so that the entire industry can lower the burden on delivery workers,” the statement read.           It said it might still go on strike if the government’s promises are not kept. Working hours will be adjusted to start at 9 a.m. once additional workers are hired.           The task force also called for the government and the logistics industry to form a civic organization that can monitor the working conditions and improve systems in the logistics industry to prevent overworking of delivery workers.             The number of deliveries has increased due to social distancing and a preference for contactless services. Total packages delivered increased 20 percent on year from January to August, according to a report submitted to a democratic party lawmaker by the Ministry of Land and Transport.             The number of packages delivered in June hit 293.4 million, which is up 36.3 percent compared to the same period last year.             BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

The model was one of the 97-year-old company’s biggest successes and a “game changer” that set the standard in the motorcycle industry and was copied by many competitors back then, BMW said.           The new version took some of the core design concepts from the original, including the oil tank shape and the emblem on it, the tube frame and the iconic black paint.           Excluding face-lifts of existing models, the new R 18 is BMW Motorrad’s first release in six years.           Its boxer engine is the most powerful yet among BMW’s models so far. The 1,802-cubic-centimeter (110-cubic-inch), two-cylinder engine can deliver up to 91 horsepower.             To offer a more “classic” riding experience, the seat’s suspension does not come with an electronic control system. But the model boasts high-tech features, including automatic stability control that adds balance during acceleration and functions to help driving in reverse or starting the engine on a hillside.             The company explained that another big focus in developing the new R 18 was expanding choices for customization. The bike was made in a way that allows for parts of different models to be attached and removed. A total of 127 custom parts will be offered to customers.             The motorcycle comes in two variations: the new R 18 Premium, costing 31 million won, and the New R 18 First Edition, priced at 33.7 million won.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
315,"Moon's buddies paid illegal salaries, says BAI","

     Choe Jae-hyeong, chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection. [YONHAP]                Close associates of President Moon Jae-in received illegal monthly payments while serving in top posts of presidential advisory groups, the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) said Thursday.             According to the BAI’s latest audit of the Blue House, the Presidential Committee on Balanced National Development paid 4 million won ($3,400) in monthly salary to Song Jae-ho from January 2019 to last January. Song was head of the committee during the period, and he received 52 million won in total.             The committee chairman is a part-time position, so Song was not eligible for a monthly salary. The committee explained to the BAI that it paid the monthly salary to Song because he served full-time as a consultant.             The BAI concluded the payments violated the law governing the committee, which prohibited any routine payment of a fixed consulting fee to the chairman.           After Song stepped down, Ghim Sa-Youl, a professor from Kyungpook National University, was named his successor. Ghim took office last March and the committee did not pay him any consulting fees.             Song is a close associate of Moon. He headed an advisory group for Moon’s presidential campaign in 2017. After stepping down from it, he was chosen by the ruling Democratic Party (DP) to run for National Assembly from Jeju A District in last April's general elections and won.           According to the BAI report, the Presidential Committee on Job Creation, chaired by Moon, paid a monthly salary to Lee Yong-seop, who served as vice chairman from June 2017 through February 2018, of 6.28 million won.             Lee’s predecessor, Lee Mok-hee, received a monthly salary of 6.41 million won from April 2018 through last February.           Lee Yong-seop is a former Gwangju mayor who worked on Moon’s 2017 presidential campaign. Lee Mok-hee is a former lawmaker who headed the planning team of Moon’s first presidential campaign in 2012.             According to the law governing the committee, a vice chairman is eligible to receive a reward for assisting a national project such as collecting data or conducting a site survey. But being given the same amount of money every month as if it is a salary is prohibited. According to the BAI, the committee got around the rules and used the payments as a de facto salary.           The committee has not paid its current Vice Chairman Kim Yong-ki, a professor from Ajou University who assumed the post in February.           The BAI said the Economic, Social and Labor Council also paid a de facto monthly salary to its head since 2010.            According to the report, the council paid 6.07 million won every month to Moon Sung-hyun after he became head in August 2017. The amount was raised to 6.38 million won a month in 2018 and 2019. This year, the council paid 6.49 million won a month to Moon.           Moon was the leader of the now-dismantled Democratic Labor Party.           The audit report was announced amid escalated tensions between BAI Chairman Choe Jae-hyeong and the administration.        According to sources, the BAI has conducted audits only on the Blue House's accounting records since 2003 till 2018. It rarely looked into general operations of the Blue House until the latest audit. When a problem was discovered, it was often hushed up, a former presidential aide said.           In 2016, the BAI conducted no audit on the Blue House. In 2017, it conducted two.             After Choe took office in 2018, the practice of going easy on the Blue House ended. For the first time in 15 years, the BAI conducted aggressive audits on the Blue House. Eight audits were conducted in 2018 and seven in 2017.             In recent months, the BAI went further and conducted audits on four presidential committees for the first time since Moon took office.             The BAI’s report also said the Blue House had violated the law governing contracts involving the government when it created a video clip to celebrate Children’s Day in May. The BAI said the Blue House paid a subcontractor 50 million won without following proper legal procedures.             A contract was signed afterwards, not in advance, the report said — a violation of the law. A warning was issued to the Blue House.           Speculation is growing that the unprecedented scrutiny of the presidential office was Choe’s counterattack against administration pressure on him to step down. Ever since Choe urged BAI members to conduct a politically impartial audit of the government’s decision to shut down the Wolsong I nuclear reactor, the ruling party has been pressuring him to step down.             Despite the country’s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, Moon favors a nuclear phaseout policy. The Wolsong I reactor was scheduled to shut down in November 2012, but the administration of Moon’s predecessor, Park Geun-hye, made a decision in 2015 to spend 700 million won to expand its lifespan through November 2022.             The Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Corporation, however, abruptly reversed the plan in June 2018. The National Assembly asked the BAI in September 2019 to investigate the legitimacy of the decision.             According to the National Assembly Act, the BAI was supposed to submit its report to the legislature by February, but the audit was postponed twice. Shortly before the general elections in April, the auditors approved a postponement.             Choe replaced the director in charge of the audit and urged the auditors to conduct an impartial investigation. DP politicians started a campaign to pressure Choe to step down, speculating that the outcome was destined to be unfavorable to the administration. During National Assembly hearings in July, they said Choe has an intention to damage Moon’s policy and he must resign.           The DP also attacked Choe for rejecting the Blue House’s request to appoint former Vice Minister of Justice Kim O-su as an audit board member. The post has been vacant for months, and Choe said he is doing his best to find a neutral candidate.           The BAI officials said its latest audit of the Blue House has no political intent. “We just announced the problems we’ve discovered because they were there,” a BAI official told the JoongAng Ilbo.           The Blue House said it had no response to the report.           BY SER MYO-JA, YOON SUNG-MIN   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
316,Seoul sues Sarang Jeil Church for W4 billion,"

     Seoul Metropolitan Government spokesman Hwang In-sik announces Friday the city government's decision to sue the Sarang Jeil Church and its head pastor, Jun Kwang-hoon. The city government alleged that Jun and the church violated laws and obstructed the city government's response to the viral cluster connected to the church. [YONHAP]               The Seoul city government sued the Sarang Jeil Church and its head pastor Friday for some 4 billion won ($3.4 million) in damages related to the coronavirus cluster connected to its adherents.             “Because the church and its pastor Jun Kwang-hoon stalled the city government’s response to the viral outbreak connected to the church by submitting fake records and broke other parts of the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act, Korea is back to battling another surge of Covid-19 cases,” the city government said in a statement Friday.             At least 1,168 patients have been traced to the church cluster as of Thursday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). It is the second-largest cluster Korea has seen. The largest was connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, whose members and people related to them accounted for over 5,000 cases in Korea since their cluster began in February.             Korea’s daily cases hovered around the 20s in early August but spiked over 100 after Aug. 12, the day the first infection was discovered at the Sarang Jeil Church, a Presbyterian church in Seongbuk District, central Seoul.           A weekend rally in Gwanghwamun Square in central Seoul on Aug. 15, in which many members of the church and Jun took part, sparked another cluster. Some 609 cases have been traced to the rally as of Friday at noon.           The city government said it filed a suit demanding compensation from the church and Jun with the Seoul Central District Court on Friday afternoon.             The city government said that damages connected to violations of the law by the church and its pastor amount to 4.6 billion won.             They include the city government’s partial coverage of treatment of Covid-19 patients in Seoul; the operation costs of community treatment centers for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms; and the losses incurred by public buses in Seoul amid heightened levels of social distancing measures implemented in Seoul since the spike in cases in the city, a majority of which have been traced to the church.           “The church and its pastor risked the safety of everyone in Seoul,” said Cho In-dong, deputy mayor of Seoul for planning and coordination, in a statement on Friday. “We will be doing our best to provide evidence for our claims on compensation.”           The church issued a statement via its lawyers on Friday saying the government should sue China instead.           “The so-called ‘Wuhan virus’ came from China,” the statement read. “The national government had better report China to the court.”           Jun, a scathing critic of President Moon Jae-in and his liberal government, has been under investigation since February on charges on breaching election laws and slander of President Moon Jae-in ahead of the April general elections.           Korea recorded an additional 109 domestic cases and 17 imported cases on Thursday, according to the KDCA.           Of the 109 domestic cases, 46 were in Seoul, 32 in Gyeonggi, seven in North Jeolla, five in North Gyeongsang, four in Incheon, three each in North Chungcheong, South Chungcheong and South Gyeongsang, two each in Daegu and Daejeon and one each in Busan and Jeju.           Of the 17 imported cases, four were from Uzbekistan, four from the United States, and one each from countries including Bangladesh, the Philippines, Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia.           Korea has recorded a total of 22,783 cases of Covid-19 as of Thursday, of whom 150 were in critical condition, according to the KDCA. Five more people died from Wednesday to Thursday, bringing total deaths to 377 as of Thursday, whilst 228 people have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 19,771.           BY ESTHER CHUNG, LEE GA-RAM   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "
317,"State Dept. not discussing pulling troops from Korea, U.S. diplomat says","

     David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. [YONHAP]                There are no discussions currently taking place at the U.S. State Department regarding the withdrawal of American troops from Korea, a senior U.S. diplomat told a Senate panel Thursday.           ""Of course, these issues all require cooperation. So we will consult [with South Korea], but there is no discussion of that in the State Department,"" David Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.           His remarks came in response to questions from Senator Chris Coons, who asked if the Trump administration is no longer considering troop withdrawals from the South, and if Washington will consult closely with Seoul if it makes such a change.             However, Stilwell's reassurance does not necessarily reflect the situation throughout the administration, such as possible discussions at the White House or the Pentagon.             Recent news reports have indicated that Trump hinted at the possibility of troop cuts as a bargaining chip as the two countries continue to negotiate the cost-sharing agreement on the upkeep of 28,500 American troops in Korea. While Seoul has offered to increase its annual commitment by up to 13 percent from the $870 million it paid last year, Washington is reportedly demanding a 50-percent hike.             Trump initially demanded that Seoul pay $5 billion per year, sources familiar with the negotiations have said.           The United States recently removed some of its troops from Germany, fueling speculation that it could make a similar move in Korea. In July, Washington said it will cut the level of U.S. troops in Germany from 36,000 to 24,000, a decision that news outlets reported was made without prior consultation with Berlin.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
318,Blackpink makes the cover of Elle,"

     Girl group Blackpink [YG ENTERTAINMENT]         Girl group Blackpink made the cover of the American edition of Elle magazine, YG Entertainment announced on Friday.           The group was on the cover of the October issue with the headline “The future is Blackpink, the biggest girl group in the world.” The story mentioned Blackpink’s upcoming full-length album “The Album” and Netflix's original documentary “Blackpink: Light Up the Sky.”           Elle placed Blackpink in the lineage of great girl groups of the past, such as the Spice Girls from Britain, and quoted the American composer Bekuh Boom as saying, “Rosé, Jennie, Jisoo, and Lisa are going to set the standard for the new girl group in America. We haven’t had anyone like them since Destiny’s Child.”            The magazine also noted their fashion sense and how all four members represent luxury brands: Jennie is Chanel’s house ambassador, Rosé is Saint Laurent’s global ambassador, Jisoo is Dior’s beauty ambassador and Lisa is the global ambassador for Celine.           Blackpink has released a series of new songs this year.

     Scene from ""Mulan."" [WALT DISNEY COMPANY KOREA]                Despite controversies and boycott movements, Disney’s live-action film “Mulan” pulled ahead of Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” to reach No. 1 in daily box office sales on the day of its release.           According to Korean Film Council, the Disney film was seen by 31,441 people on 1,420 screens on Thursday. “Tenet” fell to second place, attracting 17,481 people to 831 screens.             But ticket sales for “Mulan” have been disappointing, even considering the escalated level of social distancing. “Tenet,” which premiered under similar circumstances, sold about 137,000 tickets on its first day.             The reservation rate, or percentage of overall movie reservations, for “Tenet” was at 29.8 percent on Friday, higher than that of “Mulan,” at 25.2 percent.           The film is a remake of the 1998 animated film with the same title, about a young girl’s transformation to become a great warrior in ancient China to protect her family.             But the film has been swept up in a whirlwind of disputes that began when lead actor Liu Yifei uploaded a Weibo post last year claiming that she supports the Hong Kong police's suppression of prodemocracy protesters. After the film was finally launched on the streaming service Disney+, the film once more faced criticism for thanking governmental entities in Xinjiang, China, where the government has detaining Uyghurs — a predominantly Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic minority group — in massive internment camps.             The film has also received negative reviews for lacking an understanding of Chinese culture and deviations from the original plot. Critics have said it instead places more emphasis on up-to-date computer-generated imagery technologies and Hollywood action sequences.             BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "
320,"Battery business IPO won't affect LG Chem's controlling stake, company says","

             A public offering for LG Chem’s battery subsidiary is at least a year away and won’t affect the petrochemical company’s controlling stake, LG Chem CFO Cha Dong-seok said Thursday.           His comments came during a conference call with investors Thursday afternoon, after LG Chem’s board of directors approved the battery business’ spinoff. The business was to become a separate entity wholly owned by LG Chem.             Batteries are the second-largest revenue source for the company after petrochemicals, but are considered to have the highest growth potential, given the ongoing push by global carmakers to increase offerings of electric vehicles.           After the announcement, LG Chem’s stock prices on Thursday plummeted 6 percent from the previous trading session. Investors had pulled out on worries that the company’s value would fall after the battery business is split out, leaving petrochemicals, new materials and life sciences behind. One feared scenario was the battery subsidiary going public, which could deal a blow to LG Chem’s evaluation.             Cha, however, made clear that the company does not plan to sell more than 30 percent of its battery enterprise. Even if the procedures for an initial public offering (IPO) start immediately, it would take roughly a year to complete, he added.           Following his comments, LG Chem’s stock price on Friday rebounded 3.26 percent from the previous trading session.             LG Chem has argued that the battery unit’s split from other businesses would make it possible to secure larger funds and to make faster investment decisions in the rapidly growing electric vehicle battery market.           “The IPO will establish grounds that would allow even bigger growth for the battery business. That performance will contribute to parent company LG Chem’s shareholder value and stock prices,” Cha said.             In terms of investor interest and research and development investments, batteries took up a lot of the spotlight in the past few years, overshadowing other business segments. The battery organization’s spinoff as a standalone entity would benefit the remaining businesses to allow for a “proper evaluation and the investment” they deserve, LG said in a statement Friday.           “We plan to push for active mergers and partnerships in these business to enhance their value,” the company said.             BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

322,"[Shortcut] 빅히트 상장, 왜 하나요?","

                  빅히트 엔터테인먼트가 10월 기업공개(IPO)를 앞두고 있다는 소식에 주식시장이 설레고 있습니다. SK바이오팜, 카카오게임즈의 공모주 청약이 큰 화제를 모은 가운데 명실상부 세계 최고 아이돌 그룹인 방탄소년단의 소속사인 빅히트 엔터테인먼트가 상장될 경우 얼마나 많은 투자자들이 몰릴 지에 대해 관심이 집중되고 있는 것입니다.                     빅히트 엔터테인먼트는 어떤 회사인가요?    빅히트 엔터테인먼트는 2005년 JYP 프로듀서였던 방시혁씨가 설립한 엔터테인먼트 회사입니다. 방시혁씨는 현재 빅히트 엔터테인먼트의 의장이며 최고경영자(CEO)입니다. 빅히트 엔터테인먼트는 초기엔 케이윌, 임정희, 에이트 등 발라드 가수를 육성하는데 초점을 맞췄습니다. 방 의장은 이 회사의 지분 43.44%인 1240만주를 보유하고 있는 최대 주주입니다. 게임회사 넷마블은 그 다음으로 많은 24.87%의 주식을 보유하고 있습니다. 올해 상반기 이 회사는 매출액 2940억원에 497억원의 영업이익을 기록했습니다. 이 영업이익은 한국의 빅3 엔터테인먼트인 회사인 JYP(225억원), SM엔터테인먼트(148억원), YG엔터테인먼트(-3억원)의 영업이익을 합친 것보다 많은 액수입니다.         What is Big Hit Entertainment?    Big Hit Entertainment is a music label founded in 2005 by former JYP producer Bang Si-hyuk. Bang is currently the chairman and CEO of the company. The agency stayed rather low-key in Korea's music scene with its focus on fostering ballad artists such as K.Will, Lim Jeong-hee and 8eight. The company's biggest shareholder is Bang, with a 43.44 percent stake holding 12.4 million shares. Korean game company Netmarble owns 24.87 percent of the company, followed by a number of private equity companies. Big Hit Entertainment in the first half generated 294 billion won ($247.7 million) in sales and 49.7 billion won in operating profit. The operating profit surpassed the combined total of the three big entertainment agencies in Korea, with JYP posting 22.5 billion won, SM 14.8 billion won and YG Entertainment minus 300 million won.                     IPO는 대체 무엇이고, 빅히트에게 IPO가 왜 중요한가요?    IPO는 사기업을 공개해서 회사가 새로 발생하는 주식을 다른 일반 투자자들이 살 수 있도록 하는 것입니다. 회사가 필요한 돈을 확보할 수 있는 기회가 됩니다. 빅히트는 IPO를 통해서 확보한 돈으로 빚을 갚고, 국내외 비즈니스를 확대하고, 새로운 시설에 투자하는데 쓰겠다고 밝혔습니다. 빅히트는 플레디스 엔터테인먼트를 올초 인수하면서 산업은행에서 2000억원을 빌렸습니다. 사업을 확장하기 위해 국내외 음반 회사를 인수할 계획이며 미국과 일본 시장에 관심을 갖고 있다고 했습니다. 빅히트는 2022년까지 4050억원을 사업 확장에 투자할 예정이라고 합니다. 또 용산에 있는 신사옥으로 2021년 상반기까지 이전할 계획인데 이곳은 스튜디오뿐 아니라 문화 시설도 갖춘 곳이라고 합니다.         What exactly is an IPO, and why is it so important?    An IPO is the process that sees a private company become a public company by allowing ordinary investors to buy newly issued shares. It can be a huge opportunity for a company to secure the liquidity it needs for its business. Big Hit said it will use the newly raised capital to pay off its debts, expand its domestic and global business and invest in new facilities. In terms of debt, the company borrowed 200 billion won from the Korea Development Bank when acquiring Pledis Entertainment earlier this year. It has plans to expand its business by acquiring music labels in and outside Korea, especially with a focus on the United States and Japan. Big Hit is willing to invest 405 billion won on expansion through 2022. In terms of new facilities, it will move into a new headquarters in Yongsan District, central Seoul, by the first half of 2021, which will include not only its studios, but also cultural facilities.                     빅히트 IPO 투자의 위험은 어떤 것이 있을까요?    열기가 커지고 있지만 투자 전에 생각할 점들도 있습니다. 이 회사 지난해 매출의 97.4%는 BTS로부터 발생했습니다. 올해 상반기는 87.7%였죠. BTS 멤버들은 모두 1992년에서 1997년 사이에 태어났고, 2년 간 군대에 가야하기 때문에 BTS의 활동은 축소될 수 밖에 없습니다. 이 회사가 BTS의 공백을 현재 라인업으로 메꿀 수 있을지 살펴봐야 합니다. 빅히트에 따르면 그룹에서 가장 나이 많은 멤버인 1992년생 진은 2021년까지 입대를 최대한 연기할 수 있을 것이라고 합니다.         What are the risks to betting big on the Big Hit IPO?    Despite the enthusiasm, there are things to think about before making an investment. Big Hit's regulatory filing states that 97.4 percent of the company's sales last year came from BTS, followed by 87.7 percent in the first half of this year. BTS's activities are destined to be curtailed when its members, all of whom were born between 1992 and 1997, leave for two years to serve their mandatory military service. It remains to be seen if the company will be able to fill up the BTS vacancy with its current lineup. Big Hit said Jin, the oldest member of BTS born in 1992, will be able to delay his conscription until the end of 2021 at the latest.                     방시혁 의장과 멤버들의 지분은 어떻게 될까요?    증권신고서에 따르면 방 의장은 1240만주를 갖고 있고, 지난달 47만8695주를 BTS 7명의 멤버들에게 똑같이 나눠줬습니다. 주식의 공모 가격이 13만5000원에 설정된다면 방의장의 주식 가치는 1조6000억원에 이르게 됩니다. 만약 주가가 주식거래 첫날 상한인 160% 오른다면 주식 가치는 4조3000억원에 이르게 되는 거죠. 이는 한국 주식 부자 5위에 해당하고, 현대차그룹 정몽구 회장 다음입니다. BTS 멤버들은 각각 6만8385주씩을 갖고 있으니, 주가가 1주당 13만5000원이 되면 각자의 주식 가치는 92억원이 됩니다. 만약 첫날 주가가 160% 오른다면 멤버들은 각각 240억원 어치의 주식을 소유하게 되는 것입니다.         What would the value of Bang and the BTS members' shares be?    According to the regulatory filing, Bang holds 12.4 million shares and distributed some 478,695 shares equally between the seven BTS members last month. If the offered price is set at 135,000 won for the IPO, Bang's shares will be worth 1.6 trillion won. If the share price records the maximum 160 percent daily hike limit on the first trading day, his stake nears 4.3 trillion won, immediately making him the fifth richest person in Korea in terms of stock holdings, after Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor Group.

324, Hyundai Construction Equipment signs Algeria forklift deal,"

It did not provide the value of the deal.           The construction equipment maker has taken the No. 1 ranking in the sales of excavators over the past 10 years in the northwestern African country since it made inroads into the country's construction equipment market in 2005, the company said.           Hyundai Construction Equipment has about 540 dealer networks to sell its products like forklifts, wheel loaders and excavators in 150 countries.                 Yonhap   "
325,Criticism of sex ed books for kids raises more questions than answers,"

     Per Holm Knudsen's ""How a Baby is Made"" (1971) [JEON TAE-GYU]               In Korea, the word conservative isn’t quite enough to describe the social ban on the mention of sex especially in the public sphere. Even sex education only lightly touches on the details. Parents complain to schools for teaching students how to use condoms, never mind giving condoms out or showing educational videos about sex.          Last month, seven children’s books on sex and gender education among 199 books that were distributed to schools by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family were recalled after they were criticized by the conservative party for being inappropriate for children. Conservative parents and Christian media alike criticized the books for their “promiscuity” even though many of them have been used to teach children all over the world for decades and recognized for their educational purposes.           While it has mostly been taken for granted in Korea that sex education is lacking, the recent controversy surrounding these books has reignited the debate on whether something should be done about this status quo.           Must children always be taught only the euphemistic tales of sex or the scientific formulas of it without the details? Must sex always be left undiscussed, an elephant in the room whose presence is neither ignored nor acknowledged? How can we change the current sex education system to properly prepare children for what lies ahead of them?                ━  Where it all began              The ""Nadaum"" books withdrawn from schools [YES24, EACH PUBLISHER]               In December 2018, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family signed a memorandum of understanding with Lotte and ChildFund Korea to organize an educational culture project titled “Nadaum Books,” directed and operated by civil organization Think Sing Together, which specializes in curating children’s books. The project chose 134 books to be on the “Nadaum Book List” the following year that would help raise children’s awareness on gender and sex — the first time for Korea to create a list of children’s books specifically on such subjects.         Nadaum in Korean means “being myself,” with the slogan of “Following stories, finding yourself.” The books were about “finding what it means to be yourself, not as a female or male — just yourself” and came amid rising calls for proper education on equality as a result of a surge of feminism in Korea.           A panel of six people comprising teachers, professors and experts scrutinized 1,200 books in and outside Korea based on 26 criteria they set such as: whether the book explains how babies are born in its entirety; whether the change in a child’s body is positively explained; whether the family members comprise diverse members; whether or not the characters in the book are overly divided as male or female; and whether the book opposes discriminating people based on gender, race, wealth or disabilities. Sixty-five books were added this year to make up a list of 199 books.           The books were distributed to five elementary schools around the country in November last year, and were welcomed as the first list of children’s books put together by the Korean government on diversity and equality — but not for long.                ━  Not for Korea?              Scenes from the Korean version of ’The Love Book“ (2001) by Pernilla Stalfelt used as Rep. Kim Byeong-wook's evidence that the books ""promote homosexuality"" in his inquiry towards the Education Minister on Aug. 25. [KIM BYEONG-WOOK]               On Aug. 25, Rep. Kim Byeong-wook from the opposition People Power Party singled out seven books from the list during an Education Committee meeting held at the National Assembly in Seoul for their “inadequacy” as children’s education books. He claimed the books were “too sexual,” “caused early sexualization” and “beautified homosexuality.”           He pointed out seven books including “How A Baby Is Made” (1971) by Per Holm Knudsen, “The Amazing True Story of How Babies Are Made” (2015) by Fiona Katauskas and “The Love Book” (2001) by Pernilla Stalfelt, taking images from them to use as evidence of their inadequacy. The parts that were cited for their ineptitude included when Knudsen’s book describes adults as “liking” sexual intercourse and when Stalfelt’s book explains that anyone could fall in love, such as two women or two men.              Rep. Kim Byeong-wook, left, demands Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae answer after criticizing the content of seven ""Nadaum"" books on Aug. 25. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae explained that “the books are not displayed for students to see, and are managed separately by the teachers and librarians.” She added that she will “look into them and quickly take measures where needed.”           A quick measure was indeed taken. The Gender Ministry decided to withdraw the controversial books just a day later on Aug. 26.           But even before Rep. Kim, the books were already an issue of contention among parents. After a conservative Christian news outlet Pennmike wrote an article on Aug. 13 with a headline that read, “Gender Ministry criticized for providing schools with children’s books that promote homosexuality and give obscene descriptions of sexual intercourse,” online complaints flooded in from parents, concerned about exposing their children to such books.            An anonymous online petition was posted on the Blue House website on Aug. 24 demanding the government take the books back and prohibit them from ever being distributed again. It has been signed by 75,000 as of mid-September, which is far short of the 200,000 signatures that are needed to get an official response from the administrative authorities but still enough numerically to prove the concerns of Korean parents.                ━  A big step back        The Korean version of Per Holm Knudsen's ""How a Baby is Made"" (1971) [JEON TAE-GYU]                     After its withdrawal decision, Gender Minister Lee Jeong-ok explained on Aug. 31 that “Nadaum” was not a project that was led by the ministry, and cited Lotte as having the final say in regards to the fate of the books in a briefing that took place at the Gwanghwamun Government Complex in central Seoul.           “It was not of our intention that a project that began as a social contribution enterprise of a company would lead to social conflict,” Lee said, explaining why the withdrawal came so quickly. “Had it been a project led by the Gender Ministry, then we would have been open to discussions on the value [of the project], but we had no choice but to consider the partnership with the company since it was their business.”           The ministry explained to the Korea JoongAng Daily that the decision came after discussions with Lotte. ChildFund Korea pulled out from the project altogether. The decision is not likely to be revoked to ensure consistency in policy, but the ministry will work to develop other means of educational content — especially on sexuality. The National Assembly’s Gender Equality and Family Committee recommended the Gender Ministry get a second opinion on the decision on Sept. 7 while authorizing the 2019 budget spending and the reserve fund expenditure.           Although the withdrawal of the books doesn’t mean they've been taken off the shelves of bookstores, it does mean that Korean education has once again failed to break away from its decades-old stasis and yielded to society’s inertia, according to the myriad of statements released following the ministry’s decision.           Organizations such as the Korean Publishers Association, Cultural Action, Korea Women’s Association United and the Korean Teachers and Education Workers’ Union (also known as Jeon Gyojo), as well as authors, educators and critics urged the ministry revoke its decision and deliberate on the future of sexual education.           “What happens when the ministry makes these decisions is that other institutions such as schools and libraries start tiptoeing around,” said Shim Esther, a sex educator and also the co-author of children’s sex education book “Is This Question Okay?” (2019), who said that she has been using books that have been withdrawn for her lessons for years.           “I had been using the same books for my lessons so far, but after this decision the same organizations that were okay with my curriculum told me to take those books out of my lessons. It should be left to the children to decide on the lessons of what those books teach, but instead, they have been contaminated by a filter that have deemed them ‘unfit’ and now children are robbed of the opportunity to talk about the body as it is and think for themselves. By not teaching them, we’re not preventing it from happening — we’re just leaving them unprepared for what will happen.                ━  What will be will be              Unesco's 2018 revision of the ""International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Edcuation."" [UNESCO]               In fact, as opposed to what concerned, conservative Korean parents believe, education will not incite the children into having sex.            According to Unesco’s “International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education,” first published in 2009 and updated in 2018, comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) actually delays sexual initiation as well as decreases the frequency of sex while increasing the use of condoms. Comprehensive sexuality education is a “curriculum-based process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality” as opposed to abstinence-only programs.                            Contrary to parents’ belief that sex education will lead to their children having more sex, earlier, a survey on the aftereffects that CSE demonstrated on sexual behaviors revealed that 37 percent of 87 countries that were surveyed said its students had delayed initiation of sex after education, 31 percent said the frequency of sex was reduced and the use of condoms increased in 40 percent of the countries.            Rather than lingering on the ministry’s already-made decision, Nam Yoon-jeong, the president of Think Sing Together who led the Nadaum project, hoped that this incident could be turned into an opportunity to talk about sex education and how sex is dealt with in Korea.           “Korea had been lacking proper sex education and any discussion on sex or human rights has been shut down whenever it began,” said Nam. “We are exposed to sexual consumption and imagery everyday and everywhere, but an ironic stoic sentiment forbids us from talking about it publicly or officially. The ambivalent culture leads to children wondering about something they are exposed to, but getting twisted ideas of it because they’re not taught properly about what it is exactly. The truth must be spoken of as it is.”           BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "

[NEWS 1]               Covid-19 is changing consumption patterns, often in unexpected ways. As the pandemic continues, an increasing number of Koreans are splurging on luxury goods while simultaneously cutting down costs of daily necessities.            The two contrasting consumer sentiments are shown in the growing demand for both cheap bulk packs of household goods, like shampoo, at the same time as extravagant goods, such as high-end watches. This tendency is seen as a reflection of people looking for a bit of retail therapy to break the stress of the pandemic at the same time as trying to cut costs in everyday life.           People are coping with stress and depression by flexing on expensive items — essentially buying things to show off and feel good about themselves.            There is data to back up this paradox. According to e-commerce site Gmarket on Wednesday, sales of affordable and pricey items both rose over the past month. The tendency toward saving can be seen in sales of daily necessities and food — categories where there are lots of options and it is therefore relatively easy to try and cut costs.            Over the last four weeks, sales of large packs of detergent rose by 31 percent on year. Bulk-buying body care products rose by 10 percent and hair treatment by 26 percent. Since both items can be used over a long period of time, demand is high among one- and two-person households.            The spike in demand for reusable silicone wrap increased by almost 200 percent, while washable kitchen towels rose by 41 percent. Consumers are also inclined to buy refurbished items, which are products that have been returned to the manufacturer or vendor. During the same period, sales of refurbished home appliances and other digital products, including PCs, almost doubled.               091803-flex-gra               Affordable food items have been selling consistently, as people have been spending more time at home. Sales of large bags of rice have more than quadrupled. Due to an especially long wet season this year resulting in a spike in grocery prices, imperfect produce also sold well. On Gmarket, sales of imperfect vegetables rose 70 percent and fruit rose 42 percent.           Emart has also been running a promotion offering cheaper prices for pears and apples that are as fresh and sweet as regularly priced ones, but with less appealing shapes. These pears are 50 percent cheaper, while apples are 25 percent cheaper. Emart is planning to sell a total of 2,500 tons of imperfect apples and pears. These affordable alternatives have proven popular as they also help farms affected by the harsh rainy season.              A consumer at Emart's Seongsu branch in eastern Seoul looks at a promotional line of apples and pears, which are cheaper due to their less appealing shapes. [YONHAP]               Yet at the same time as all this bargain hunting, luxury goods have been selling well both online and offline.             Sales of luxury watches on Gmarket marked a 126 percent on-year increase. Clothes from high-end brands saw a 17 percent increase in sales, while sales of other luxury merchandise rose by 31 percent.             Selling luxury products from duty-free stores, which started to be available to regular customers from July, were a big success. Hordes of people lined up for offline events at department stores from the break of dawn, while servers often broke down during duty-free stores’ online events.            People are also spending a lot on their hobbies.           Most of the categories under leisure saw a double-digit percentage growth. Sales of golf equipment rose by 14 percent, and sales of camping equipment by 22 percent. Despite the long monsoon season this year, fishing equipment sales also increased by 4 percent.           The premium home appliance market has also seen rapid growth. Sales of clothing care machines, dishwashers and capsule coffee machines all saw significant jumps in sales.           “The coronavirus pandemic’s effect on consumption patterns has been combined with the you-only-live-once [YOLO] trend, which has settled in the mainstream culture,” said a Gmarket spokesperson. “This pattern is expected to continue until the pandemic lets up and economic recovery begins.”            BY JEON YOUNG-SUN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
333,LG Chem to spin off battery business in December,"






     The LG Twin Tower in Yeouido, western Seoul. [YONHAP]         LG Chem’s battery business will be spun off from the company in December.           According to SNE Research, LG Chem was the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker in the world during the first half of 2020 with a 24.6 percent market share.           The spinoff was approved by the board of directors Thursday and will be put up to a final vote at a shareholders meeting on Oct. 30. The plan is for the battery unit to become a new corporation tentatively named LG Energy Solution on Dec. 1.           It will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of LG Chem.           In a Thursday statement, the company said it does not have immediate plans to list it on the stock market.           “Nothing is decided on the matter for now, but we are going to review various options,” it said.           Rumors of such a spinoff have circulated for some time among investors and industry analysts.           Petrochemicals generate more than half of LG Chem’s revenue, but EV batteries are the business with the most potential. Last year, batteries were the company’s second largest revenue source, comprising 29 percent.           Local analysts and the company have claimed that this year would be the turning point when EV batteries started making profits. In the April-June period, the battery unit reported its largest operating profit of 155.5 billion won ($132.6 million) after losing money for nearly two decades. LG’s EV battery business first saw profits in the fourth quarter of 2018 but went back into the red afterwards.           Carmakers like Volkswagen and General Motors are trying to make EVs an integral part of their business. Market estimates differ according to research firms and analysts, but the general assessment is that EVs will make up around 20 to 30 percent of vehicle sales by 2030.           “The battery industry is experiencing rapid growth, and the EV battery business has just started to make big profits. We decided this is the optimal time for a spinoff,” LG Chem said in a statement Thursday.           “The entity is expected to generate 13 trillion won in revenue this year. Our goal is to hit 30 trillion won in annual revenue by 2024.”           Local analysts generally approved of the spinoff.           “A lot of LG Chem’s capital expenditure [capex] in recent years was concentrated on batteries. But the battery market is expected to rapidly grow in the next three to four years, which means even more capex will be needed,” said Kim Hyun-tae, BNK Securities analyst.           “At a time where other business units need investment as well, continuing the capex focus on batteries alone creates a burden for the company in terms of financing and regarding fairness among business units. It’s better that the battery unit is spun off as a separate corporation to attract and execute funding.”           However, LG Chem’s stock price plummeted 6.11 percent from the previous session on Thursday as investors worried that LG Chem’s value may fall after the spinning off of its business with the most potential.           “We believe the value of the spun-off battery business is the key variable,” said Mirae Asset Daewoo Analyst Park Yeon-ju, adding LG Chem is likely to maintain control of the battery business after the spinoff and a potential initial public offering.           “If the post-spinoff value of the battery business is higher than the current value reflected in the market, LG Chem’s shares should rise to reflect this in advance.”           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

335,'Traceless' infections are Korea's new coronavirus worry,"

     In compliance with social distancing measures banning demonstrations involving 10 people or more in the capital, members of a union representing street vendors in western Seoul protest outside the Mapo District Office on Thursday with dolls. [YONHAP]         Health authorities Thursday said more than a quarter of those diagnosed with the coronavirus in Korea over the past two weeks were traceless, the highest proportion since officials began to compile the data in April.           The Central Disease Control Headquarters said in a statement that among 2,013 people who tested positive for the virus from Sept. 4 to Thursday, 532 people, or 26.4 percent, represented traceless cases, which means epidemiologists could not determine where or how they got infected, raising concerns of inadvertent transmission.           With the Chuseok holidays coming up, this trend could lead to a serious outbreak, officials warned.           Jeong Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), the new name of the upgraded Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), said in a Thursday press briefing that the Chuseok holidays could lead to “a very dangerous situation” for Korea’s fight against the pandemic.           The Chuseok holidays, also known as the Korean harvest festival, is one of the country’s two largest holidays when families gather to eat and pay respect to their ancestors. This year’s holidays last three days from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2, but Oct. 3 and 4 are a weekend, which means many people will have five days off. The other big holiday is Seollal, or Lunar New Year’s Day, slated for mid-February 2021.           “For the upcoming holidays, please refrain from visiting your families and traveling, and think of the period as a time to prevent the spread of the virus,” said Jeong. Health “authorities, too, will do our best to contain a possible outbreak with heavy responsibility.”           Jeong noted she was worried about the holidays not only because of traceless infections but also due to the fact that daily cases haven’t dropped steeply enough.           Korea added 153 new cases Wednesday.           Over the past 15 days, Korea’s daily virus count has hovered between 100 and 200, lower than the 300 to 400 cases that were being recorded in late August, but still not hitting the government’s goal of fewer than 100.           Jeong stressed the need to wear face masks at all times, calling it a “self-vaccine” and “safety belt,” especially when the world doesn’t have a vaccine yet. In the winter, personal protection will particularly be important given the fact that the virus is expected to more easily spread than in the warmer months, she stressed.           Over the weekend, health authorities said they would announce whether Level 2 social distancing measures currently imposed on the entire nation will be lifted for regions outside the Seoul metropolitan area on Sunday midnight as planned.           Authorities stressed that even if the central government does decide to lift the Level 2 measures for areas outside Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi on Sunday, the loosened restrictions will probably last for only a single week before the Chuseok holidays kick in.                            Officials said that discussions were also underway for an overhaul of the current three-tier social distancing system to make some changes in specific restrictions, and also the criteria by which the central government decides when to raise or lower the levels.             Details are expected to be relayed by the end of October.           Among Wednesday’s 153 new cases, 145 were local infections, according to KDCA data, including 62 in Seoul, 52 in Gyeonggi, nine in South Chungcheong, seven in Incheon, six in North Gyeongsang, three in South Gyeongsang, two in each Busan and Daegu and one each in Gwangju and Daejeon.           Out of eight imported cases, four were from Uzbekistan and one each from the Philippines, Indonesia, the United States and Canada.           Five people died Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 372, while 233 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 19,543. As of Wednesday at midnight, 22,657 coronavirus patients had been counted in all.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

""Despite working 13 to 16 hours every day to sort packages, we have not received a single dime for our hard work.""           The group held a vote of 4,358 KCTU members and nonmember delivery workers, with 95.5 percent voting in favor of the collective action.           Among the people who voted for the strike, 500 people are not members of the union.           Delivery workers argue the current payment structure doesn't compensate them for the many hours they spend sorting deliveries, as they are paid per parcel delivered, not per hour.             The Transportation Ministry advised logistics companies on Sept. 10 to temporarily recruit more workers to sort deliveries as deliveries increase ahead of the Chuseok holidays.             President Moon Jae-in also urged the public Monday to pay attention to problems of overworked delivery workers.             The workers say they regret causing inconvenience and ask for the public's understanding, but the union criticized logistics companies for turning a blind eye to the problem. It also said they are willing to cancel the strike if companies come up with a good plan.           BY HONG SU-MIN, KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

338,Freshness is the key component of this at-home vegan meal kit ,"

     Home-cooked version of Foovement's new vegan Sichuan-style tteokbokki with black bean sauce. [LEE SUN-MIN]                Foovement, a new meal kit company, offers a variety of vegan and special options to make dining at home more interesting.           The company that has been offering meal kits in eco-friendly packages since its launch this month introduces vegan Sichuan-style tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes) with black jjajang (black bean) sauce, a dish which is unlikely to be found on offer at many restaurant in Seoul.           Although made entirely from vegetables, it is almost impossible to tell as the dish lacks nothing in terms of deep flavors. The savory black sauce that covers the chewy tteok, rice cake, makes you continuously reach out for another bite. The texture of the ""fish cake"" is very bouncy, adding another enjoyable texture. If you are not a big fan of the tongue-numbing Sichuan chili flavors, you can simply exclude the chili oil or just drizzle just a little bit.           If you weren’t told, it would be difficult for you to tell this particular dish is vegan. While the red spicy version of tteokbokki is more widely known and available, the jjajang version, whose sauce is usually made with pork, is also welcomed by many foodies. The entire dish seems a bit large for just one person, but not enough to share with another.           It felt like a fresher meal as the package is refrigerated, not frozen. The package is usually delivered on the day of your order, or on the date you designate when purchasing.           Inside the package is a pack of tteok, a pack of ""fish cake"", jjajang sauce and Sichuan-style spicy chili oil. The packages aren't labeled, so one may be confused with the black sauce and the chili oil, but just keep in mind that the smaller package is the chili oil, so use with caution.           You just need to put everything but the chili oil in a pot and boil for about four minutes until the rice cake gets softer and coated well with the sauce. Cooking is easy, but you might have to stir often to keep the rice cakes from getting stuck to the bottom of the pot.           In addition to the taste and simplicity, another added bonus is that all the materials used to carry the ingredients and sauces are all either reusable or decomposable.              Foovement's package. [LEE SUN-MIN]               The plastic is made from 100 percent biodegradable resin, according to the company, and the composting process doesn’t spawn any toxic chemicals. Cooling packs used to keep things fresher during the delivery process are made with only water and starch. Even the container made of wheat straw is branded with the phrase, “For Earth, For Us” to show the company is all about sustainability for the future whilst feeding people something tasty and healthy.           To spread the word about the values the company respects, it joins hands with other specialty food packages like broth maker Korean Stock and noodle maker Grand Noodle to introduce its meal kits. It also introduces a plate of dan dan noodles by restaurant Juban to appeal to fans of such dishes.           The cost of the vegan tteokbokki is 12,000 won ($10). Four other menu options are also available. The prices of other dishes range from 9,500 won to 15,000 won, and they tend to sell out quickly.           Since it is not frozen food, you can get it on the day of your order as long as you purchase before 8 a.m. When you place your order, you can also choose when you want it delivered. Packages are dispatched within 24 hours since they are produced for ultimate freshness.           BY LEE SUN-MIN   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]         "

Foreign viewers will be able to whip up the dishes themselves too, as the show will focus on using ingredients that are readily available in foreign countries.           At 5 p.m. Saturday, the same members will go live again to provide fashion tips while referencing clothes worn by Korean actors in Korean dramas. The members will also offer some candid information about how they do their hair and makeup alongside a professional stylist, the city continued.           On Sept. 25, pre-recorded videos of Seventeen members introducing cultural content will be uploaded on the Seoul Tourism Organization’s YouTube channel. One video will take viewers on a virtual journey through Insa-dong, a popular tourist destination in Jongno District, central Seoul, where the boy band will be shown making Korea’s iconic banchan (side dish) kimchi and trying out spicy food.           In another video that’s planned for Sept. 25, the members will show off some of their dance moves in a video introducing Seoul’s K-pop culture, and suggest a K-pop dance challenge for viewers to follow at home.                Members of K-pop boy band Seventeen plan to go live this Saturday on YouTube to introduce Korean culture in an initiative organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

     Wilshire Grand Center in Los Angeles. [HANJIN GROUP]               Korean Air Lines is lending $950 million to a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary in the United States.             The company's board of directors voted Thursday to make the loan to Hanjin International, which owns the 73-story Wilshire Grand Center (WGC) in Los Angeles.             Earlier this year, Hanjin International was downgraded by Moody's and S&P due to weak cash flow and a single source of revenue, though Moody's noted later in the year that the parent's support of the debt was a positive.             Of the $950 million, $900 million will go toward servicing the debt maturing this month, while $50 million will be used to cover operating costs for building, which houses an InterContinental Hotel, offices and restaurants.            Korean Air Lines explained that most of the funds would be disbursed this year. Of the total, $300 million will be sourced from the Export-Import Bank of Korea.            While the airline has considered the sale of noncore assets, the loan suggests that the building will not be sold in the near term.          Late chairman Cho Yang-ho and his father and founder of the airline Cho Choong-hoon bought the site in 1989, which at the time had a 15-story hotel. Redevelopment took eight years, cost $1 billion and finished in 2017. Most of the debt that is currently on the books is from the project.          BY CHU IN-YOUNG, PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

343,Choo says neither she nor husband requested favors for son,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, left, answers a question from Rep. Kim Sang-hoon of the People Power Party (PPP) on Thursday at the National Assembly.  [YONHAP]                Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae on Thursday rejected opposition lawmakers' accusations that she or her husband had made a request to the Ministry of National Defense to seek a favor for her son when he was serving in the military in 2017.             ""I never made the request [to the ministry],"" Choo said during a National Assembly hearing on Thursday. ""I also checked with my husband and confirmed that he had never done so.""             ""I and my husband were always too busy with our work,"" Choo continued. ""My children had to take care of their own matters.""             Choo and her family have been battling allegations that her son, surnamed Seo, received preferential treatment when he was serving in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, from November 2016 through August 2018. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).            Several whistle-blowers have alleged Seo was let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of a sick leave in June 2017, which had already been extended once. Suspicions were raised that Choo or her husband had telephoned the ministry to seek a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days. Choo's aide at the time was also suspected of having contacted the military to extend the leave.             On Wednesday, Rep. Shin Won-sik of the opposition People Power Party (PPP) said he had received a tip from a member of the military.           ""The ministry's call center reportedly received a phone call from a woman inquiring about the extension for Seo,"" Shin, a former Army general, said. ""The caller was a woman, but she used the name of Choo's husband.""             Since January, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors' Office has been investigating the case. As the probe was moving slowly, more whistle-blowers started talking to the PPP lawmakers and media about suspected favors Seo had received.           As new allegations were raised, prosecutors questioned Choo's son earlier this month and raided the Defense Ministry and Army's data centers on Tuesday. They seized records of phone calls related to the controversial extension of Seo's medical leave, sources informed about the probe have said.             Opposition lawmakers asked Choo on Thursday if she would be willing to ask Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl to speed up the investigation into her son.           ""I am a subject of the probe,"" she said. ""I cannot intervene.""             During the hearing, Choo also urged the politicians to not defame her son.           ""Please just see the truth as it is,"" she said.           In the face of aggressive attacks from the PPP, lawmakers of the DP stepped up their campaign to defend her. The DP members' efforts, however, may have backfired and further fueled the outrage directed at Choo.           On Wednesday, Rep. Park Sung-jun, spokesman of the DP, issued a statement to defend Choo and her son.           ""During his military service, Choo's son took a medical leave and underwent a knee surgery in order to fulfill his duty as a soldier,"" Park said. ""Our national hero Ahn Jung-geun said it is a soldier's duty to sacrifice one's body for the country, and Seo was carrying Ahn's philosophy into action.""             One of the most respected patriots of the country, Ahn was a Korean independence fighter who in 1909 assassinated Hirobumi Ito, the first Japanese resident-general of Korea. At the age of 30, Ahn was executed in 1910 in a prison in China, and Park was quoting Ahn's last calligraphy written before his death.             Park's statement generated fierce criticism from the public, as well as from opposition politicians.             ""How dare you mention Ahn to defend a case of foul play?"" Rep. Kim Eun-hye, spokeswoman of the PPP, said.       Three hours later, the DP removed the sentence mentioning Ahn from the statement. Park also issued an apology later in the evening.           ""I made an inappropriate quote and stirred up a controversy,"" he said. ""I apologize for the incident and I will be more careful.""           ""The DP was not directly comparing my son to Ahn,"" Choo said Thursday. ""They were just stressing that my son tried to do his best to serve the military although he was sick.""           Earlier this week, DP Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon, floor leader of the party, created yet another flap while trying to defend Choo.           ""I was told you can extend your leave from the military by making a request through phone call, email or Kakao Talk chat,"" Kim said on Tuesday.             Following Kim's remarks, the PPP said Kim was denigrating the military in order to protect Choo.           ""Kim was treating the military service as if it is a camping trip,"" Rep. Yun Hee-suk of the PPP said.             The military said that a soldier, in theory, could inquire for an extension of his or her leave by using any possible means. But former and incumbent senior members of the military told the JoongAng Ilbo that in reality, no commander would grant an extension of a leave through a Kakao Talk chat.             As Choo was bombarded with questions about her son on Thursday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun asked opposition lawmakers to stop grilling her and instead focus on other official business.           ""We've been spending days on the Choo issue,"" Chung said. ""The people must be disappointed. Let's leave it alone and discuss state affairs.""             Chung also said anyone can call the Defense Ministry call center to make a request or an inquiry, adding that he does not think Choo would deserve criticism even if she had done so.             BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

     Cable cars start reoperating in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) of Paju, Gyeonggi, this week. [YONHAP]               Tours in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) run by the government in Paju, Gyeonggi will reopen next Tuesday, ending the 11-month hiatus since they were halted by the area's African swine fever outbreak last year.           “The tours will be held 10 times a day, each with less than 20 visitors at a time, to keep up with the Covid-19 social distancing recommendations,” the Paju city government announced on Thursday. “Group tours with more than 20 people will operate only through reservations.”           The city government had been running shuttle bus tours in the DMZ area, one of the most militarized zones in the world, which visits three locations: the Dorasan Station that used to connect the two Koreas; the Dorasan Observatory, which provides a look toward North Korea’s Kaesong city and villages; and the Third Tunnel near the observatory.           The latter is one of Paju's most popular DMZ-related tourist destinations, one of four infiltration tunnels built by North Korea under the inter-Korean border following the Korean War (1950-1953). The tunnel, discovered in 1978 by the South Korean military, spans over 1,635 meters (5,364 feet) in length and is 2 meters wide and 2 meters high.             The tours were shut down last October due to the African swine fever outbreak, which took hold of South Korea's Gyeonggi areas especially. The shutdown was extended with the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak in Korea earlier in the year.           “There will be several checkpoints where visitors will have their body temperatures measured,” the city government said in its statement Thursday. “We have held several simulations with the Army to ensure that each tour, of up to 20 visitors at a time, will be conducted in a manner to ensure they are well spaced out.”              ""We are One"" by artist Yi Chul-hee, one of the artworks exhibited in Imjingak area of Paju, Gyeonggi. [YONHAP]               Other tours in the area, including the cable car rides across the Imjin River, have also started back up.           “We shut down the cars due to the swine fever outbreak last year but recommenced them in April,” said Eom Joo-young, an official of the Paju city government, over the phone on Thursday. “Due to the Covid-19 situation, however, visitors could only watch the scenery from within the cars and were not allowed exit upon reaching the other side of the river. We restarted on-foot tours on the other side of the river on Tuesday.”           Because the city government requires visitors to register their personal information, including their names, addresses and phone numbers, the tours are not yet open to foreign visitors, it said.           “We need to be able to trace people [if outbreaks take place], and it would be too hectic trying to locate foreign travelers without permanent addresses or readily-reachable phone numbers in the country,” a city government official said. “Tours will be open for foreigners when the government reduces the social distancing recommendation level to one.”           The so-called ""DMZ peace trails"" — hiking trails that opened last year in the DMZ areas of Paju and Gangwon’s Cheorwon and Goseong counties — remain shut down following the swine fever and Covid-19 outbreaks.             BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "

The Kazakhstani government has been promoting the usage of Latin script among the public, and Q-pop has been an effective means of doing so for the past few years.             Nowadays there are a handful of Q-pop acts including girl groups, boy bands and soloists, but it was boy band Ninety One and its 2015 debut EP that began it all.           The Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with the band for a video interview with the group.               관련기사Q-pop boy group Ninety One shows that music knows no language   BY LEE JUNG-JOO [lee.jungjoo@joongang.co.kr]    "
346,"When it comes to sex ed, this Danish author says just talk about it ","

     Danish writer and sexologist Per Holm Knudsen, author of ""How a Baby is Made"" (1971). [PER HOLM KNUDSEN]               “How A Baby is Made” is a children’s sex education book written by Danish writer and sexologist Per Holm Knudsen in 1971. Simple and bold illustrations are accompanied by straightforward and detailed descriptions of how a couple engages in sexual intercourse, how a baby is made and the birthing process.           The book was awarded the Danish Ministry of Culture’s Children’s Book Prize in 1972 and has been recognized as one of the most respected works in the field of children’s sex education in the world.           It was also included as a “Nadaum” book last year. In December 2018, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family signed a memorandum of understanding with Lotte and ChildFund Korea to organize an educational culture project titled “Nadaum Books,” directed and operated by civil organization Think Sing Together, which specializes in curating children’s books. The project chose 134 books to be on the “Nadaum Book List” the following year that would help raise children’s awareness on gender and sex — the first time for Korea to create a list of children’s books specifically on such subjects.           Nadaum in Korean means “being myself,” with the slogan of “Following stories, finding yourself.” The books were about “finding what it means to be yourself, not as a female or male — just yourself” amid the rising calls for proper education on equality that came in recent years as a result of the feminist surge in Korea.           But ""How A Baby is Made"" has been making headlines in the recent days as the most “outrageous” example of seven books that have ultimately been withdrawn from elementary schools last month — specifically for the “early sexualization of children” and “encouraging sexual intercourse among elementary school students,” according to Rep. Kim Byeong-wook.              Per Holm Knudsen's ""How a Baby is Made"" (1971) [JEON TAE-GYU]               There are reviews that describe the honesty of the book as “traumatizing” and it was met with a fair share of opposition from conservative Christian politicians when it was released in Denmark, but never for the arguments raised in Korea according to the author.           “I’ve never heard that this should be the case in the almost 50 years the book has been on the market in many, many countries,” Knudsen told the Korea JoongAng Daily in an email interview. “I agree, that sex should be ‘taught carefully and ethically,’ of course. But I think — excuse my words — it is ridiculous, to argue that the book ‘instigates sexualization from an early age’ and ‘encourages children to have sex at an early age.’           “Children are curious sexual beings no matter how many children's books on how to make children they read: Sexuality is the drive that ensures that there are still people here on earth, and small children have this drive in their own way as well.”           The following are edited excerpts from the interview, where the author shared his thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding his book and sex education in Korea.              Per Holm Knudsen's ""How a Baby is Made"" (1971)             What made you write “How A Baby is Made”?       I had written four children’s books before ['How A Baby is Made']. There was a sexual and antiauthoritarian break up in Denmark and in western Europe in general in the late '60s. In 1949, Danish sexologist Sten Hegler made a book for children called 'How mom?' My mother read it to me and my brother when I was a child. It was not as explicit as I thought it should be in 1969, so my book is the answer to the other book — How a baby is made.I wanted to tell the correct narrative about how people make children — no more birds and the bees.             Do you believe that sex education should be taught regardless of age?       Sex is not dangerous, it is a natural and common action between people all over the world and it is the most common way to have children. No children are harmed by those facts, and the story can always be adapted to age and knowledge.             Upon hearing the news that your book was retrieved from schools in Korea, what was the first thought that came into your mind? How did you deal with negative feedback that you may have had in the past?       There is nothing new about conservative Christians and other conservative religious people having difficulty with sexuality, even though it is something their gods have institutionalized. It's a bit of a paradox. In Denmark, this kind of rigid conservatism still exists, albeit to a very limited extent. Denmark has in many ways become a very open and straightforward society when it comes to sexuality. In time, that is likely to change in Korea as well.             Where do you think proper sex education begins?       Sex is a powerful drive that will always pop up one way or another if one tries to suppress it. It's like trying to get a cork to stay on the bottom of some water. It will always search up to the surface.I think sex is pleasurable, healthy and necessary as a human being. Not everyone thinks so, and that's their business. My work over the last 50 years has been to help free sex from constricting norms. In Korea, you have to talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, be open about sex — and take risks that might outrage and anger some, but most people want a liberated and happy sexuality.         BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
347,Film production falls 22% in first 8 months of the year due to pandemic,"

                  The number of film productions in Korea decreased more than 20 percent in the first eight months of this year due to the protracted novel coronavirus pandemic, a report showed Thursday.           A total of 18 films were shot from January through August, down 22 percent from 23 over the same period last year, according to the monthly report by the Korean Film Council (Kofic).           The fantasy drama ""Our Season"" and the crime movie ""Bogota,"" starring Song Joong-ki, started filming in January, followed by the crime action film ""Voice"" and the action drama ""Protector,"" directed by star actor Jung Woo-sung.           But the massive Covid-19 outbreak in Korea in late February and the global pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the filmmaking schedules of local productions in the spring.           The crime science-fiction film ""Alien,"" director by renowned filmmaker Choi Dong-hoon, started production in late March after multiple delays due to the pandemic.           Song Joong-ki's ""Bogota,"" about a Korean man who emigrated to Colombia, halted shooting at a location in the South American country and returned to Korea in March on worldwide travel bans stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic.           In addition, producers of the spy movie ""Negotiations,"" starring Hyun Bin and Hwang Jung-min, put off its overseas filming schedule in Jordan and went on with shooting in Korea in April.           Thanks to the eased phase of the virus spread, the fantasy film ""Wonderland,"" directed by Kim Tae-yong and starring Gong Yoo and Tang Wei, began its shooting schedule in April. The filming of the blockbuster disaster film ""Emergency Declaration,"" starring Song Kang-ho and Lee Byung-hun, also started in May.           But the protracted coronavirus scare has kept producers and film crews from commencing shooting in the summer.           No films started production in June, and only three movies, including the crime thriller ""Limit,"" began shooting in July and August.           In particular, production of ""Emergency Declaration"" has been suspended after a staff member was found to have come into contact with a Covid-19 patient on Aug. 31.           The Kofic report said a number of upcoming film productions, including ""Apgujeong Report"" starring Ma Dong-seok, will be affected by a spike in coronavirus cases in recent months.           As Korea has reported over 100 new daily confirmed virus cases for about a month, the government has tightened distancing guidelines, banning indoor gatherings of 50 or more people and outdoor events with 100 or more.           Yonhap   "
348,The Gangnam-Gangbuk price gap remains ,"

     A woman looks at apartments in an area south of the Han River on Wednesday. [YONHAP]          The price gap between apartments on either side of the Han River remains as wide as ever.           A pyeong — 3.3 square meters (35.5 square feet) — on average costs 43.45 million won ($37,000) in the 11 districts south of the Han River, often referred to as Gangnam, according to data from 10000-lab.           In 14 districts north of the Han River, referred to as Gangbuk, a pyeong cost on average 30.89 million won last year.           The number of apartment complexes in Seoul where units cost more than 100 million won per pyeong was 52 on Sept. 14. Of those, 50 are in three districts south of the river — Gangnam District, Seocho District and Songpa District.           The remaining two are Trimaje in Seongdong District, western Seoul, and Hannam The Hill in Yongsan District, central Seoul.                                  According to a report by the Hana Institute of Finance, the house price index jumped by 45.5 percent between May 2017 and May 2020.             In 2013, 41 percent of all house transactions were made by people who don't already own an apartment. That was 31 percent in the first half of 2020.           “While multiple homeowners were able to buy additional apartments, people who don’t own any houses were not able to purchase any,” the Hana Institute of Finance report said.             Sky-high apartment prices in Korea have led people in 30s to start panic buying. Of all who purchased apartments in Seoul this year, 28 percent were people in their 30s, a four percentage point increase from 2017. Subscription ratios for new apartments in Seoul are nearing 340 to 1.           The government is currently reviewing a plan to use development profits in Gangnam to develop Gangbuk, but it's not clear if that would work.           “As Gangnam has better transportation, education and living environment, high demand inevitably increases the housing prices in Gangnam,” Heo Yun-kyung, a research fellow at the Construction Economy Research Institute of Korea, said. “The plan might be helpful improving living environment of Gangbuk, but the Gangnam-Gangbuk gap will still widen.”           Lee Chang-moo, a professor of urban planning and engineering at Hanyang University, agrees.             “Based on transportation data, a lot of commuters not only from Seoul but also from Gyeonggi go to Gangnam,” Lee added. “Jobs are concentrated in Gangnam, which is the major factor in determining housing prices.”             BY YEOM JI-HYEON, SUNG JI-WON   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]                 "
349,Autonomous car insurance to be available soon,"

     Hyundai Motor's Xcient truck installed with autonomous technology. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]          Insurance products for partially autonomous vehicles will be introduced within weeks.             The Financial Services Commission (FSC) said Thursday that 12 insurers in Korea will offer new insurance products for autonomous vehicles used for business purposes by the end of September.            Insurance programs have been developed for self-driving cars before, but only for those used for test purposes. This is the first time insurance products will be sold for autonomous cars that run on public roads.            The FSC said it was important to develop the program so that risk can be properly assigned if an accident occurs.          Vehicles are graded Level 0 through 5 for their degree of autonomy, with Level 5 indicating that the car can drive without any human input.          The soon-to-be-introduced insurance program will include a clause that mandates insurers to compensate first and then seek compensation from the manufacturer if the car or its systems are found to be at fault. The policy will require that the driver cooperate in any investigation.          As autonomous cars may be vulnerable to system errors or hacking, the premiums will be 3.7 percent higher than for other policies. No discounts for accident-free years will be given.          The FSC said it will continue to monitor the automotive industry and collect data in order to introduce an insurance program for self-driving vehicles that are not for business purposes.             BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]                                     "

[YONHAP]                President Moon Jae-in will participate remotely in the United Nations General Assembly next week, the Blue House said Thursday.             According to Blue House spokesman Kang Min-seok, Moon will participate in a videoconference of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, New York time. A pre-recorded video address by Moon is scheduled to be aired around 2 a.m. Wednesday, Seoul time.             The UN decided to hold the 75th session of the General Assembly via video link due to the coronavirus pandemic. It invited world leaders to submit pre-recorded videos of speeches that will be livestreamed. According to Kang, 120 heads of states and 53 global leaders of the 193 UN member states plan to participate.             In his speech, Moon will ask for the international community’s cooperation to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, Kang said. “He will also seek the international community’s support for the Korean government’s efforts for peace on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia,” Kang said.             Speculation is high that Moon will use the speech to make a new proposal to North Korea to improve deteriorated inter-Korean relations and possibly make a breakthrough in North Korea-U.S. relations.             Last year, Moon proposed to transform the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas into an international peace zone with the help of the UN.            That proposal was snubbed by the North.             A presidential aide said Thursday it is premature to discuss details of Moon’s message to the North in the upcoming speech.             Moon is also scheduled to participate in a high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN session.             At the meeting, Moon will give a speech as leader of a group of cross-regional middle powers known as Mikta. The five-member group was launched in 2013 and its other members are Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey and Australia.

351,Government to create 15 smart green industrial complexes,"

     President Moon Jae-in, third from right, tours Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction's gas turbine parts manufacturing plant in Changwon, South Gyeongsang, on Thursday. [YONHAP]               The government plans to invest a total of 3.2 trillion won ($2.7 billion) in developing smart green industrial complexes by 2025.           The government is aiming to increase the number of smart green industrial complexes to a total of 15 by 2025, including upgrading the seven smart industrial complexes designated in 2018.             The complexes are expected to create 33,000 jobs while raising renewable energy production from the current 0.6 percent to 10 percent and improving energy efficiency by 16 percent.           The plan was announced during President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Changwon industrial complex in South Gyeongsang on Thursday. The trip was his fourth related to the Korean New Deal, starting with a visit to an artificial intelligence company in Chuncheon in Gangwon on June 18.           The government since 2018 has designated seven smart industrial complexes.           Changwon and Banwol were the first to be selected in February 2019. Changwon industrial complex, known for manufacturing machinery, will now specialize in developing smart machinery and robotics.           Moon visited the industry complex in South Gyeongsang as it is also the first city to introduce a hydrogen-fueled public bus, also part of the the government’s push for more green energy projects.           “Changwon is an industrial complex that has the possibility of being the fastest in converting to a smart green industrial complex,” Moon said. “I expect Changwon industrial complex to grow as the [most] representative smart green industrial complex and become a model as a global industrial cluster.”           According to the government, the seven smart industrial complexes account for 66 percent of all companies located in the 47 industrial complexes nationwide. Goods produced at the seven smart industrial complexes account for 50 percent of all production at industrial complexes, while 64 percent of industrial complex workers now work at the seven smart facilities.           The government said upgrading facilities to a smart green industrial complex will contribute to innovation in the manufacturing industry.           The administration plans to increase the ratio of smart factories from the current 5 percent of all factories in the country to 20 percent by 2025. Additionally, innovative data centers will be set up that collect data from factories and reuse it as needed.           A joint control system including logistics platforms and management of chemical and toxic material that would not only maximize logistics flows but also contribute in preventing accidents is also planned.           The industrial complexes will expand adoption of green energy, including setting up renewable energy power plants like hydrogen power generators, while plants will also have solar panels installed on the roofs.           Factories within the complexes will install factory energy management systems while maximizing the efficiency of energy usage through smart energy platforms, as well as installing equipment that will reduce pollutant but not hurt the production processes.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

The rising demand propelled ESR’s stock price 47 percent higher from the initial offering price as of Sept. 16, according to SK.           The proceeds, it said, will be used to invest in promising industry sectors.           “[SK] will make a virtuous cycle by investing the earnings from the sales into high-growth sectors,” the company said in a statement. “SK has funded diverse segments including biopharmaceutical, materials and renewable energy based on its expertise on investment.""            The unit’s holdings include ride-hailing start-up Grab, Lingbao Wason Copper Foil, a leading copper foil manufacturer in China, and Visible Patient, a French start-up focusing on health care artificial intelligence technology.           Founded by New York-based private equity fund Warburg Pincus, ESR builds and operates large-scale logistics properties.

     U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, left, and Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo at a press conference following bilateral alliance talks in Washington in February. [YONHAP]               Korea took part in the Pentagon’s first multinational conference on military artificial intelligence (AI) on Tuesday and Wednesday, widely regarded as an attempt to build a coalition against China’s rapidly expanding technological capabilities.             The “AI Partnership for Defense” meeting, hosted by the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) under the U.S. Department of Defense, included around 100 delegates from 13 democratic countries, including Korea, Japan, Australia, Britain, France and Israel.             The meeting was the first of its kind, held to share “lessons learned and best practices in harnessing AI for their respective and shared defense missions,” according to a JAIC press release.             “What we are doing is nothing short of historic,” said Mark Beall, head of strategy and policy at the JAIC.             Though the JAIC officials have denied the meeting was intended to build a joint front against one particular country, participating countries all share close security ties to Washington as well as similar values in their democratic forms of government.             According to the Pentagon’s 2020 China Military Power Report, Beijing is concentrating on advancing emerging technologies including big data, AI and cloud computing and is pursuing a military-civil fusion development strategy to harness civil technologies and strengthen its military capabilities.           The AI partnership is just one facet of a multipronged effort by the United States, outlined in its National Defense Strategy, to unite allies and fellow democracies into a larger coalition to counter major adversaries like China and Russia.             One multinational forum that has gained recent traction as a coalition of this kind is the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, also known as the Quad, involving Australia, India, Japan and the United States.             The forum began under the initiative of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during his first term in 2007, and was later revived as an anti-Beijing alliance around 2017 in response to China’s increasingly aggressive behavior and territorial ambitions.             Under U.S. President Donald Trump, security planners in Washington have been envisioning a reorientation of U.S. global strategy away from a system of various bilateral alliances — which some scholars call a “hub and spokes” system — to a more integrated form of collective security that involves enlisting allies in a concerted effort to check China’s ambitions.             U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper made this rationale clear in his remarks at a seminar on Wednesday, where he stressed the necessity of building what he characterized as a structure in the Indo-Pacific akin to NATO in Europe.           Washington will continue to work toward expanding the Quad to involve other countries, Esper said. According to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry, Korea has been asked to join the forum’s upgraded version in the “Quad Plus,” after the country participated in a Quad meeting for the first time in March 2020 along with New Zealand and Vietnam to discuss Covid-19.             Seoul, however, is torn on whether to further commit to U.S. efforts, given its strong economic reliance on China.             In a press conference following his return from the United States, First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-gun said he had relayed to Washington Korea’s unique position of being a close ally to the United States but also a neighbor to China, with which it shares a close relationship both strategically and socioeconomically.             “It wasn’t as if [the United States] forced us to choose between [Washington and Beijing],” Choi said.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]         "

[YONHAP]               The United States proposed talks with North Korea to discuss humanitarian assistance in the wake of Covid-19, according to a diplomatic source.            The source, familiar with bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea, told the JoongAng Ilbo Wednesday talks had been proposed through the so-called New York diplomatic channel at the United Nations in New York.           “North Korea has yet to give a substantive answer, but contact is continuing,” the source said.             The information jibes with remarks on Tuesday from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who hinted talks were ongoing between the two countries in spite of lackluster progress in denuclearization negotiations over the past two years.             ""It's gone quiet publicly, but there's still lots of work going on […] and even efforts with the North Koreans to come to understand where there may be opportunity as time goes on,"" Pompeo said in an online seminar.           On Sept. 9, Pompeo said on Fox News he hoped to extend humanitarian aid to North Korea amid its economic difficulties and the threat from Covid-19. U.S. President Donald Trump also remarked in an interview on Sept. 7 he was open to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un again if the latter was willing.           Such activity feeds speculation that the Trump administration is angling for a high profile diplomatic event with Pyongyang — possibly involving Pompeo and Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s younger sister to whom he has reportedly entrusted direction of foreign policy.           According to South Korean and U.S. intelligence, Kim Yo-jong is continuing to take an active role in governance in addition to her delegated authority over relations with Washington, testified by her visit to typhoon-hit areas in the country on Sunday.           The younger Kim, intelligence sources said, made a visit independent of her brother’s stops in towns devastated by floods and typhoons in North Hwanghae Province on Saturday and Monday.           North Korea is currently facing its biggest economic crisis since the mid-1990s amid Covid-19 and serial natural disasters, with three typhoons and one of the longest rainy seasons on record this summer.           The storms and the devastation they wrought on the country’s food producing and other areas — including a key rare-earth mining area in South Hamgyong Province — forced a drastic alteration of economic plans this year, with Kim Jong-un ordering the regime’s attention be directed towards recovery efforts.           It is unclear whether Pyongyang is willing to accept international aid given the emphasis it has placed on autarky after its nuclear talks with Washington became stuck in a stalemate.           In a high-profile ruling Workers’ Party Political Bureau meeting on Aug. 13, Kim ordered the country to reject all external help with regards to Covid-19 or flood damage, insisting the North will surmount its current crises through its own self-reliant means.             Pyongyang has since rebuffed aid offers from international relief groups as well as South Korea, though it is believed that it continues to receive help from its traditional ally in China.             A number of diplomatic sources said this self-imposed isolation may be part of Pyongyang’s larger strategy to hedge its bets with regards to Trump’s re-election chances in the U.S. presidential election in November.             In July, Kim Yo-jong released a statement rejecting the possibility of another summit with the United States this year, noting the regime was preparing for how to deal with not only Trump but also a succeeding presidential administration in Washington.           “Chairman Kim may be buying time with his slogan of self-reliance, but he is really holding out for the next U.S. administration to maintain an openness to dialogue and denuclearization negotiations,” said Cho Seong-ryoul, a senior advisor at South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy.             “A third summit before the election is unlikely, but First Vice Department Director Kim Yo-jong could meet Secretary of State Pompeo around October.”           BY JUNG HYO-SIK, SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

In 2010, the soundtrack for “Song Of The Cloud,” by cartoonist Ho Rang was released as an album. At the time, indie bands who were not that popular participated in webtoon soundtracks.             The trend has been changing recently. As webtoons soundtracks have become a big source of profit for companies, they are scrambling to hire popular singers and K-pop idols.               “The webtoon market has now become an industry that actually produces videos and music,” Seo Chan-hwe, a cartoon columnist, said. “Webtoon soundtracks have started gaining popularity since early this year when soundtracks of popular webtoons 'The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor' and ‘Itaewon Class’ were released.”           The webtoon intellectual property market is likely to exceed 1 trillion won ($851 million) in value this year. According to Korea Development Institute, it was about 210 billion won in 2014.           The sharp increase in the market size is largely led by the popularity of webtoon-based films and dramas. Webtoon-based JTBC drama “Itaewon Class” has gained a lot of attention from Koreans and closed with the second-highest ratings ever for a drama on JTBC.            “Webtoons have no limits, so they can be reproduced in any types or genre,” said Jung Hwan-suk, vice president of Daum Webtoon.             Han Chang-wan, professor at Sejong University’s Fusion Arts Graduate School, agrees.             “Soundtracks can also be used when producing dramas or movies in the future,” Han said. “Singers can make debuts through webtoon soundtracks, and companies can use those as a means of attracting more viewers.”           BY JUNG WON-YEOB, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
356,Foreign minister kicks off trip to Vietnam to discuss fast-track entry,"

     Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha speaks to reporters at the Incheon International Airport ahead of departing for a two-day trip to Vietnam Thursday. [NEWS1]               Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha kicked off a two-day trip to Vietnam on Thursday, where she is expected to push for a fast-track entry system for essential travelers amid coronavirus travel restrictions.             She is scheduled to hold talks with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh and discuss coordinating a response to the Covid-19 pandemic and other bilateral and global matters. She later plans to pay a courtesy call on Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.             Regarding a fast-track system between the countries, Kang told reporters at the Incheon International Airport Thursday morning that, “There remain areas that we need to focus on coordinating.”             She noted that the sides are trying to reach an agreement as there may be a slight discrepancy on “quarantine measures that [Vietnam] considers as necessary and what Korea considers as necessary.”           Kang added that important issues to discuss include resuming passenger flights and other ways to expand people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.             Korea has worked to arrange a fast-track procedure for Korean businesspeople traveling to key partner countries to minimize economic fallout amid global travel restrictions.             Kang called Vietnam a key partner that is part of Korea’s New Southern Policy, the Moon Jae-in administration’s initiative for economic and diplomatic cooperation with Southeast Asia and India.             “It is significant that Vietnam, a country we especially have a lot of people-to-people exchanges with, is the first Asean country I am visiting” since the coronavirus outbreak, she said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.             Vietnam is the second country Kang is visiting since the Covid-19 pandemic nearly halted face-to-face diplomacy. She visited Germany in August, her first overseas trip since February.             Last week, Kang held a series of virtual Asean-related meetings including the Asean Regional Forum (ARF) and East Asia Summit (EAS), amid tensions between the United States and China and the stalled North Korea denuclearization talks.             Vietnam was the host of this year’s ARF and related events, although the Covid-19 pandemic prevented diplomats from gathering in person.           Countries adopted the annual ARF chairman’s statement ARF Hanoi Plan of Action II.           Foreign ministers in the 2020 ARF chairman’s statement recognized “the efforts and achievements made by all the parties concerned for advancing the peace process on the Korean Peninsula over the last two years and urged all concerned parties to resume peaceful dialogue and continue working constructively towards the achievement of lasting peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula.”             The statement “noted the international efforts to bring about the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and urged North Korea to fulfill its commitments and “pledge to refrain from further nuclear and missile tests.”           The ministers also noted Seoul’s “proposals to advance inter-Korean relations” and added that Asean-led platforms such as the ARF can promote “a conducive atmosphere to peaceful dialogue amongst the concerned parties.”           They also “reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and promoting peace, security, stability, safety and freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea” and recognized the benefits of maintaining it “as a sea of peace, stability and prosperity.”           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

[KOREA TOURISM ORGANIZATION]               International travel is limited, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t get on a plane. To keep the attention of avid travelers in Taiwan, the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) is bringing them to Jeju without having them get off the plane.           About 120 people will board a plane from the Taipei airport on Saturday to just fly around the air space of Jeju Island without landing, before returning home. Those who take the trip will earn round-trip flight tickets to use for one year from the point that leisure travel between Taiwan and Korea resumes and other perks for future use. The package, released on Sept. 11, sold out within four minutes.           As this package is aimed at getting locals in Taiwan excited about their future travels, many different entertainment programs will be offered in flight. They will get to take pictures wearing hanbok, traditional Korean garments, before departure, and will be served the famous chimaek, a combination of fried chicken and beer as an in-flight meal.           The state-run tourism company learned that enthusiasm for packages that enable a vicarious in-flight experience is gaining popularity in Taiwan, during a local expo held in Taipei last month, and decided to make such a program with Taiwan’s travel agency ezfly as well as with Tigerair. About 71 percent of 518 people who visited the Korea booth during the expo answered that Korea is the first country they would visit when the pandemic dies down.           To continue to discover ways to keep the attention of foreign travelers, the state-run tourism organization along with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, is encouraging people to share their favorite travel spots where foreign travelers might also be interested in visiting.           Any Koreans or foreign nationals currently residing in Korea over the age of 15 can pitch their favorite spots in Korea either via videos that are less than three minutes long or in written form. People are also being encouraged to share courses that are suitable for a day trip or an overnight trip and should provide a map with routes.           The Culture Ministry and the tourism organization will accept videos until Oct. 14, and courses from Sept. 21 to Oct. 21.

Hawaii's governor says that starting Oct. 15, travelers arriving from out of state may bypass a 14-day quarantine requirement if they test negative for Covid-19. [AP/YONHAP]               Hawaii Gov. David Ige said Wednesday that starting Oct. 15, travelers arriving from out of state may bypass a 14-day quarantine requirement if they test negative for Covid-19.           Travelers will have to take the test within 72 hours before their flight arrives in the islands. Ige said drug store operator CVS and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente will conduct the tests as part of an agreement with the state.           Earlier this year Ige planned to start a pre-travel testing program on Aug. 1 only to have to postpone it as Covid-19 cases spiked on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii. A shortage of testing supplies also forced delays. Another start date for Sept. 1 was also canceled. Airlines are expected to help inform travelers of the requirement.           Hawaii leaders are hopeful that pre-travel testing will encourage people to return to Hawaii in a way that keeps residents safe. Tourism traffic to the state has plunged more than 90 percent since the pandemic began, forcing hundreds of hotels to close and pushing many people out of work.           ""I want to emphasize that this pre-travel testing will allow us to add a greater element of safety for travel into our state,"" Ige said at a news conference.           Lt. Gov. Josh Green, who joined the news conference via Zoom because he tested positive for the disease and is isolating at home, said the program will provide economic opportunity at a time when so many people are suffering. Upheaval from the pandemic pushed nearly one quarter of Hawaii's workforce into joblessness. In April, Hawaii had the third-worst unemployment rate in the nation after Nevada and Michigan.           ""I worry about the long-term impacts of economic distress and that impact this has on our people, when they can't afford their homes as easily or groceries or health care,"" Green said.           On Wednesday, the state's Department of Health reported Hawaii had an average of 118 cases per day for the past seven days.

363,HSBC and BCG issue warning about trade protectionism,"

     Shipments stocked up at a port in Busan on Sept. 1. [NEWS1]               The global economy is set to lose $10 trillion of growth over the next five years if the trade war between the United States and China worsens, HSBC and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) warned in a recent report released Thursday.           Their forecast came as Korea exports fall for their sixth straight month. While the rate of decline has eased, the weakness in outbound shipment growth persists.             “The Covid-19 pandemic represents a further deep shock to global trade. It is prompting a reconfiguration of value chains around the world, as countries look to reduce their reliance on certain foreign suppliers and increase their self-sufficiency in strategic industries, and as firms seek to reduce their dependence on single sources of supply,” the report said. “There is a real risk that these trends may further fuel a damaging spiral of trade restrictions and retaliation.”           The report noted that trade for the G20 countries, which account for 60 percent of the global merchandise trade, could expand 2.5 percent compounded through 2025, which translated into $10 billion of economic growth in that period. It added that this is important as the world recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.           If trade protectionism prevails, “it will impose a persistent drag,” the report notes.             HSBC makes 80 percent of its profits in China, including Hong Kong, while Boston Consulting Group has a large practice in the country, with four offices there.           The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has also warned about trade restrictions and their effect on the global economy.           On Wednesday, the international organization announced a revised forecast for growth that was slightly better than its June forecast. While the global economy is expected to contract this year, the fall will be 4.5 percent rather than the 6 percent projected in June.             OECD chief economist Laurence Boone during a press conference noted that global trade continues to struggle.             This ""is partly because the trade restrictions that were imposed during the crisis has had a huge cost,” Boone said. This not only includes restrictions on business trips but also increases in administrative barriers.             She said closing borders and administrative barriers raise trade costs as little as 8 percent to as much as 16 percent, which wipe out profits and forces businesses to reconsider their trade strategies.             ""The more barriers we set up for trade, the more we request visa and licenses or unjustified restrictions, the more complicated we make trade, more business will think ‘This isn't worth it,’ 'This export isn't worth it' and that has a cost when it comes to economic activities as well as jobs,” Boon said.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
364,This year's MU:CON focuses on offering a helping hand,"

     Singer and songwriter Yoon Sang, who is also this year's MU:CON art director, poses for photos prior to an online interview with the local press on Wednesday afternoon. [KOCCA]               While lesser-known musicians are finding it tough to find their future online amid the coronavirus pandemic, MU:CON hopes to provide them with opportunities to reach out to buyers and audiences, art director of this year’s MU:CON, Yoon Sang, said on Wednesday.           Yoon Sang, whose full name is Lee Yoon-sang, was appointed to direct MU:CON 2019 and has been chosen again for this year's event. MU:CON has been organized by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and held by the Korea Creative Content Agency (Kocca) every year since 2012 to provide a sphere of discussion for music experts and a stage to perform on for the smaller indie acts, while also allowing local musicians to come in direct contact with overseas buyers for business opportunities.           This year’s MU:CON takes place from Wednesday to Saturday next week, with all events open online due to the coronavirus. The event will kick off with a congratulatory performance from K-pop acts including Teen Top, GFriend, Dreamcatcher and ONF on Wednesday evening. A two-day conference on various subjects will take place on Thursday and Friday, while showcases by performers in and outside of Korea will take place online from Thursday through Saturday. An online pitching and networking function will be available throughout the four days of the event on the official website.           “I think it might be confusing for someone who doesn’t really know what MU:CON is,” Yoon Sang told local press during an online interview that took place on Wednesday afternoon. “These are hard times due to Covid-19, and we thought that MU:CON might not take place. But we are happy that it’s taking place amidst turmoil for the musicians. All the large-scale music festivals around the world are being canceled, and it’s so meaningful that this event is still a go.”           As the art director, Yoon Sang took part in deciding which artists would perform at the showcase while presenting and introducing the event to other participants. During the judgement process, none of the judges are allowed to share their thoughts with each other. The panel consists of numerous experts including journalists and musicians, who were careful to choose musicians from a pool of various genres “because K-pop isn’t the only genre to represent Korea,” according to the director.           “Seventy teams with great potential were chosen as a result,” he said. “Personally, I felt greatly moved by the fact that there were so many artists with so much talent. I hope that MU:CON is a chance for such artists to be recognized more overseas.”              Yoon Sang sits down for an interview at last year's MU:CON [KOCCA]               Other than the fact this is the first time for the event to be held online, this year will focus even more on establishing business ties with overseas buyers for the local musicians through an online platform provided by Kocca. The conference subjects will also revolve around the various predictions of what will become of music after the coronavirus pandemic, as well as how the industry must adapt to the change.           “The focus of this year’s event is that the overseas buyers get to find talent through MU:CON, and we help them introduce the musicians to their home countries,” Yoon Sang said.           He also stressed that while this year, K-pop sensation BTS topped the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time ever for any Korean act and other major K-pop groups continue to entertain fans around the world through the online platform, the seeming openness and accessibility of cyber space has turned out to be deceiving, and it has actually made it harder for smaller indie bands to survive.           “BTS’s performance has been stunning, but we must not forget that realistically, Covid-19 has posed a challenge greater than ever for other artists,” he said. “We need a system where musicians get to perform online, get paid from it and communicate with the fans. Some musicians could just perform for a handful of fans in their own studios, but even that is impossible unless they are famous to some extent.           “Unless the musicians are a part of the big data, then they are deprived of the chance to be introduced at all. In such a situation, MU:CON has opened up the opportunity for all musicians of all genres. We believe that this is an important role of MU:CON because performing here at least gives them a chance to be mentioned, and we’re giving them the chance to perform even if it’s for a very few number of people.”           MU:CON awaits its 10th event next year. As a musician, Yoon Sang just believed this to be another music festival. However, having gotten to know it further, he believes that MU:CON could be one of the most meaningful music events there is for smaller, growing musicians.           “I’ve realized that MU:CON is a sphere of communication that also allows business opportunities. Musicians get to perform whilst some 400 people from the music industry are watching them, and every stage is an opportunity to lead them to marketers and the public. I hope to see more people come to MU:CON and experience the miracle of performing here and being connected to the overseas market,” he said.           BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "

369,Big business says legislative revisions are a big problem,"

     Vice Chairman Kwon Tae-shin of the Korea Federation of Industries speaks to the press. [YONHAP]               Six business associations have jointly criticized a set of legislative amendments that could soon become law.           Their leaders claim revisions to the Commercial Act and Fair Trade Act awaiting National Assembly vote include elements that could constrain the business activity of companies in Korea.           The six groups are The Federation of Korean Industries, Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business, Korea Enterprises Federation, Korea Listed Companies Association, Kosdaq Listed Companies Association and The Federation of Middle Market Enterprises of Korea.            The set of bills, eight in all, include measures that would require holding companies to own more of their subsidiaries and strengthen independence for outside auditors.             The six groups said the revisions are outdated and far behind the global standard and warned they will make Korean companies less competitive in the global market, eventually having a negative impact on the local economy.             Companies have claimed the revisions are “poisonous,” arguing they will increase costs to acquire new companies and weaken the power of major shareholders.             “If the revisions to the two laws are passed at the National Assembly, they will cause side effects,” the statement read. They will force “companies to spend more to acquire stakes of other companies.”           They said after the revisions, it would cost an additional 30.9 trillion won ($26.3 billion) for 16 local chaebol to transition into holding companies. If the same amount was invested in the companies, it would create some 244,000 new jobs, according to industry officials.            The government is also speeding up reforms in the labor law to meet International Labour Organization standards. Already more than 10 revisions are awaiting approval in the National Assembly.           At the center of controversy is a revision of the Trade Unions and Labor Relations Adjustment Act, which allows laid-off employees and jobless people to join labor unions.             The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry submitted a report to the National Assembly on behalf of local businesses urging the government to keep the power balance between labor and the companies.             “The government’s reform to the law on labor unions overly emphasizes labor rights over those of the corporations, tipping the balance between the two sides. There are concerns the revision will escalate conflicts, and the industry officials advise the government come up with countermeasures to protect employers,” the report read.            The six groups advised the government take a cautious approach to revising laws that hinder business activities, especially when Korea is faced with an economic crisis.             “Countries around the globe are easing regulation to overcome economic difficulties. Deregulation should be the priority so that companies can freely invest and create jobs. The government needs to be discreet in revising laws that could dampen our efforts to tackle the economic crisis,” read the statement.             BY LEE SOO-KI  [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
370,LG pushes new boundaries in quest to reinvent the smartphone,"

     LG Electronics has taken an unconventional approach to smartphone design, starting from the leather-backed G4 on the far left to the rollable model it is expected to release next year. [YONHAP]               When it comes to smartphone design, LG Electronics plays by its own rules — from its swiveling LG Wing to a recently-teased rollable device, LG appears willing to try anything to make its mark on the phone market.           During a live online event on Monday, LG unveiled the LG Wing smartphone, which has an OLED top display that swivels to reveal a second display hidden underneath. Instead of a foldable phone, which already appears to have been accepted as the next big thing in smartphone design, LG continues to go its own way, refining its lineup of dual-screen devices.           Over the last few years, LG has carved out a reputation for rejecting market trends in favor of products that do the same job, but the LG way.           At the LG Wing launch event, LG showed a teaser video for a future rollable phone. The video appears to show a thin phone with a second or expanding screen being pulled out from the side with the tagline ""Hold your breath.""           According to industry insiders, a prototype for the phone — thought to contain a second screen that rolls up when pushed inside for storage similar to LG's rollable television — has already been made, and the device is on track to be released in the first half of next year.           Although LG has not seen great success with its smartphones, it has had several “firsts,” gaining a reputation for its design experiments.            The beginning of its one-of-a-kind design started with the leather-backed G4 in 2015, the fourth model in its flagship G Series. Although its quirky form factor was much anticipated, the phone saw disappointing sales.           Despite the lagging sales of the G4, LG continued to push unconventional designs.            The company released the G5 in 2016, incorporating modular design with the battery sliding in and out of the phone, dubbed the “transformer phone.” The phone could also be used as a digital camera or high-quality sound system when used with other modular gadgets. The innovative design caught the market’s attention, but it was still considered impractical.           As the high-end smartphone market turned to foldable screens last year, LG began to explore dual-screen alternatives, offering virtually the same user experience but without the need for expensive folding panels.            Instead, LG rolled out its V50 ThinQ, a smartphone with a separate, detachable screen. Some users praised the model, saying that it is a solid alternative to foldable smartphones. Last week, Microsoft rolled out a similar model, the Surface Duo, which has an emphasis on productivity.           The launch of the LG Wing shows that LG has improved on its dual-screen system, bringing both displays into one device. The LG Wing is the first device in LG's ""Explorer Project"" product line.          “The existing smartphone market has already reached its peak,” said Andrew Coughlin, head of mobile business at LG Electronics UK during the live event. “LG will take a different approach from other premium smartphone brands and avoid the cookie-cutter form factors.”             As for the foldable phones that every other manufacturer is obsessed with, LG doesn't really see the point, saying it has not found any significance in the design besides the showy aspect of the foldable feature.           “Why wouldn't a company with a rollable TV release a foldable phone?” said LG Electronics CEO Kwon Bong-suk, at CES earlier this year. ""LG will make a change in the smartphone market, even if it takes time.""           LG’s performance in the smartphone business has been a thorn in the company's side for years, recording a loss during the second quarter this year for the 21st consecutive quarter. Its cumulative deficit now amounts to 4 trillion won ($3.4 billion).           “Apple has secured its place as a leader in the premium smartphone market, and Samsung has the biggest share in the local market in terms of supply quantity,” said an expert in the smartphone industry. “LG judged that it is difficult to compete with the two giants, so it found its niche in form factor innovation.”           BY JANG JOO-YOUNG, LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
371,LG Chem board to discuss spinning off battery business,"

                  LG Chem, Korea's leading chemical company, will hold a board meeting this week to discuss a spinoff of its battery business, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.           LG Chem could finalize its decision on the issue in an emergency board meeting on Thursday, they said.           The company said it could not confirm whether it will hold a board meeting and it will announce its decision through a regulatory filing in case of any changes.           In December, LG Chem said in a regulatory filing that it is mulling various strategic options to strengthen competitiveness of its battery business, though no specific decision was made.           The proposed spinoff comes after LG Chem's battery business unit achieved an operating income of 155.5 billion won ($132 million) in the second quarter on quarterly record sales of 2.82 trillion won.           LG Chem has said its battery business unit could continue to post sharp growth in the third quarter due to increased shipments of electric vehicle (EV) batteries to Europe and increased sales of cylindrical batteries.           LG Chem is a key supplier of batteries for electric vehicles, including those of GM, Ford, Renault, Volvo, Audi, Volkswagen and Daimler, as well as Korea's largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor, and its smaller affiliate, Kia Motors.           LG Chem has said it is on track to boost its production capacity to 100 gigawatt hours by the end of this year, which is enough to supply batteries for about 1.7 million electric cars.           The company has also said its order backlog for EV batteries is currently valued at more than 150 trillion won.           Yonhap   "

375,Hyundai to enter U.S. market with hydrogen trucks in 2022,"

     Hyundai Motor's Xcient Fuel Cell at the company's Jeonju plant in North Jeolla. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               Hyundai Motor will start selling its hydrogen-powered truck in the United States in two years.           The announcement of entry to the market comes as one of the most promising competitors is facing fraud allegations. Phoenix-based Nikola has been accused by a short-seller of being little more than bluff, and news reports indicate that the Justice Department is investigating.           During a conference call held Tuesday, the Seoul-based automaker said sales of its hydrogen-powered trucks will begin in the United States in 2022, with a pilot program in California next year.           Maik Ziegler, vice president of Commercial Vehicle Global Business Expansion at Hyundai Motor, who formerly served in Daimler's commercial vehicle department, participated in the conference call as a head speaker.           The presentation also mentioned plans for Hyundai Motor to locally manufacture a midsize truck powered by hydrogen in Sichuan, China, from 2022.           ""Hyundai Motor revealed plans that it is going to two-track in its electric mobility business with lithium-ion battery vehicles for passenger cars and hydrogen-powered ones for commercial cars,"" said Kim Jin-woo, an auto analyst at Korea Investment & Securities who participated in the call.           ""It picked Toyota as its strongest competitor in terms of hydrogen mobility technology.""           Hyundai Motor will start its hydrogen truck business in the United States with big clients that operate an average fleet of 3,000 to 5,000 trucks because they usually run on set routes. This makes it easier for Hyundai to build charging infrastructure.           Ziegler said the company is negotiating with a potential client in the United States that is expected to make orders for Hyundai Motor’s hydrogen trucks bigger than existing orders in Europe.           Hyundai Motor recently shipped 10 Xcient Fuel Cell trucks to Switzerland, where Hyundai Hydrogen Mobility will lease them to logistics companies. Hyundai has plans to ship a total of 50 units by this year and expand the number to 1,600 by 2025.             It also signed memorandum of understanding with French industrial gas company Air Liquide in 2018 to supply a total of 5,000 hydrogen-powered trucks by 2025.           ""Compared to Nikola, which has damaged its credibility lately, Hyundai Motor's products have high credibility among customers and can be immediately supplied when an order is submitted,"" said Lee Jae-il, an auto analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities, who was also on the call.           Hyundai Motor is currently manufacturing Xcient Fuel Cell, the world's first mass-produced heavy-duty truck powered by hydrogen that can drive up to 400 kilometers (250 miles) per charge, at its Jeonju plant in North Jeolla.             ""For that reason, Hyundai Motor is expected to secure an upper hand in order competition in the U.S. hydrogen truck market,"" the analyst added.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "
376,One of Korea's most popular webtoons comes under fire for misogynistic and sexually violent content,"

     The poster of the Naver webtoon ’Hellper“ by Sakk. [SCREEN CAPTURE]         The author of ""Hellper 2,"" one of the most popular webtoons on the nation’s biggest portal and webtoon platform Naver, has suspended publishing the dark action fantasy after being criticized for portraying a series of misogynistic and sexually violent content, including rape, prostitution, illegal spycam filming and drug abuse.           The controversial scenes include the rape of a middle school girl whose face viewers allege resembles the popular singer IU, and the torture of an elderly woman by stripping her and injecting her with drugs. The middle school girl character Lee Ji-geum does not only resemble singer IU but also shares the same name as IU's Instagram ID.             Instead of releasing a new episode for this week, author Sakk posted a letter explaining the controversy over his work along with an announcement that he will take a break from the series.              One of the controversial scenes from the webtoon ’Hellper“ where a character of a middle school girl that strongly resembles a celebrity appears on the verge of being raped. [TWITTER CAPTURE]         The author explained that portraying the controversial scenes including sexual abuse and torture was a means “to show the true self of the villains” whom were to be punished in the end. “Those scenes were to illustrate the ultimate message that good triumphs over evil,” he wrote. Injecting the older woman with drugs was also inevitable to explain a change in her personality in season 2 from season 1 and to illustrate how inhumane the villains can be, he said. “I felt bad for the character while drawing that scene, but it was the scene that I put my maximum effort into. I think that’s why the scene came out more sensationally than my usual work,"" Sakk said, adding that he will adjust the controversial scenes.            ""Hellper,"" which has been published by Naver's Webtoon as part of a series since October 2011, has continued with a season 2 rated R from January 2016, releasing new episodes every Wednesday.           Since the start of the new season, issues had been consistently raised among fans regarding the sexual objectification of women in the webtoon. But the recent episode 247 released on Sept. 8, which includes the scene of the elderly woman being tortured, was the trigger that raised the issue to the public by the readers themselves. On the webtoon’s fan community on the internet community platform DC Inside, readers posted strong complaints about the episode. In particular, one reader on Sept. 10 posted a summary of problematic contents in the webtoon, referring to 23 different episodes from “Hellper 2.”             ""It is definitely a problem to see such sexist webtoons being published on such a big platform as Naver without any regulations, although it is rated R. We [fans] raise the issue, as even we are tired of the misogynistic and vulgar expressions in 'Hellper,'” a reader wrote on the community.           Soon the “#stop_misogyny_in_webtoons” (translated) movement spread on Twitter, which shed light on the issues to a wider audience and led the author to apologize and suspend the series.              The members of eight different committees including the Special Committee on Gender Politics of the Basic Income Party and the Cartoon Sexual Violence Countermeasure Committee hold a press conference demanding the suspension of the series of Gian84’s popular Naver Webtoon ""Bokhak Wang“ in front of Naver Webtoon headquarters in Seongnam, Gyeonggi, on Aug. 19 [YONHAP]         The “Hellper” controversy comes just a month after Gian84’s popular Naver webtoon ""Bokhak Wang"" was also embroiled in controversy over misogyny and degrading the disabled. When concerns arose that the webtoon disparages women, Gian84 made adjustments to the problematic scene, but demands continued for his withdrawal from MBC’s reality TV show “I Live Alone” and a suspension of the “Bokhak Wang” series.           As similar controversies arise related to popular webtoon series, readers say that practical measures are needed to regulate their content. Unlike broadcast content, there is no legal body that regulates the content of webtoons. Age ratings are also set by the authors and distributors according to the standards of the webtoon self-regulation committee, and there are no institutional and legal measures to impose sanctions on the content.           “Although Naver Webtoon officials had warned me to keep the level of violence and sexual material in check to not disturb readers, despite it being adult content, I always went a bit beyond their guidelines because of my greed as an author,” Hellper author Sakk wrote.           Naver Webtoon also added an apology at the end of the writer's letter, saying that they will monitor the expressions of sensitive content more carefully.           “As social sensitivity to misogyny increases, we will supplement the guidelines more thoroughly,” Naver Webtoon said.           BY KIM HO-JEONG, KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

378,"Korea's economy to contract 1% in 2020, OECD predicts","

     Samsung Electronics' NAND flash production factory under construction at Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, in May. [YONHAP]               The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has revised up its forecast for Korea's 2020 economic growth, or down, depending on which number is used.           The international organization projected a decline of 1.0 percent in its September OECD Economic Outlook, which is slightly better than the minus 1.2 percent figure issued in June. But it is worse than another OECD forecast for Korea issued in August, when the organization predicted a 0.8 percent decline in 2020.           In the September report, Korea was the best-performing OECD country. It is the second best-performing in the G20, as China is forecast to achieve 1.8 percent growth in 2020.           The drop in the OECD outlook for Korea in 2020 between August and September was the result of the resurgence of Covid-19 case numbers last month that led to the government implementing stricter social distancing measures, which included limited access to coffee shops and restaurants and shutting indoor gyms and internet cafes.             The social distancing rules were eased this week as the number of daily confirmed cases dropped from a recent peak of 400 to about 100.             The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecast the Korean economy to contract 1.0 percent in 2020, and that's good news considering that the estimate is unchanged from June.           State-financed Korea Development Institute (KDI) is looking for a 1.1 percent decline, down from an earlier projection of minus 0.2 percent. The Bank of Korea (BOK) earlier changed its outlook from a 0.2 percent drop to a 1.3 percent decline.           Korea’s economy is expected to recover next year, with the OECD forecasting 3.1 percent growth, unchanged from the June forecast. Turkey and the United States are also expected to rebound to precrisis levels next year.             The OECD report stated that the output in most economies at the end of next year will likely remain below 2019 levels.             ADB expects 3.3 percent growth for Korea in 2021. That’s a 0.2 percentage-point drop from June’s projection of 3.5 percent.           The OECD report cautioned about quick cutbacks in government spending next year.             “The aim must be to avoid premature budgetary tightening,” the reported noted. “Premature withdrawal of fiscal support in 2021 would stifle growth, as occurred in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in many countries.”             The global economic growth forecast was raised from a 6 percent decline in June to a 4.5 percent drop in September. The U.S. economy is expected to contract 3.8 percent, an improvement from June’s forecast of a 7.3 percent decline, while Europe's GDP is expected to decline 7.9 percent from the previous 9.1 percent projection.             While the forecasts for most countries were revised upward, those for India and Mexico were revised downward.             India’s growth is expected to plunge 10.2 percent, far sharper than the 3.7 percent decline projected in June. Mexico's economy, which was projected to contract 7.5 percent this year in June, is expected to suffer a drop of 10.2 percent.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]                                 "

380,Finance minister defends extra spending at Assembly,"

     Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki answers questions by lawmakers at the National Assembly in Seoul, Wednesday. [YONHAP]               Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki defended the government's spending in the National Assembly, saying more debt was unavoidable in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.             “We’re in a situation where the role of [expansionary] fiscal policy is crucial,” said Hong at the National Assembly on Wednesday.             He said that Korea’s national debt and fiscal balance is good compared to other countries.           “My judgement is that we still have fiscal space,” Hong said. “I don’t understand arguments that we are [heading toward] a sovereign default.”             He said a recent successful sale of $1.45 billion in foreign exchange stabilization bonds demonstrated foreign investors’ confidence in Korea.             “If not for that confidence, we wouldn’t have succeeded in the forex stabilization bond,” Hong said.             The government last week said it succeeded in issuing $1.45 billion in forex stabilization bonds at record-low interest rates.             Included were 700 million euros ($831 million) worth of bonds, the first euro-denominated forex stabilization bonds in six years.             It was the first time a non-European country was able to issue a bond with a negative yield. The yield on a five-year euro-denominated bond was minus 0.059 percent.             “My evaluation [of the economy] is that the supplementary budgets have helped significantly in overcoming the crisis,” Hong said, citing an August OECD — Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development — report.            In its last month's “Economic Survey of Korea,” the OECD said thanks to the Korean government’s “prompt response” against Covid-19, Korea is experiencing the “shallowest recession among OECD countries.”             The OECD projected Korea's economy to dip 0.8 percent this year, an improvement from June's projection of negative 1.2 percent growth.            However, in a report released Wednesday, the OECD slightly adjusted its outlook to a 1 percent decline due to the resurgence of the coronavirus since August.        .       Three supplementary budgets amounting to 59 trillion won ($50 billion) have been approved and a fourth amounting to 7.8 trillion won, is currently under review.             With the fourth supplementary budget, which will be funded through government-issued bonds, the nation’s total debt is estimated to amount to 846.9 trillion won. That’s nearly 42 trillion won more than the 805 trillion won expected at the beginning of the year.             It is nearly 120 trillion won more than last year’s debt, and equivalent to 44 percent of the country’s GDP.             Although Korea’s debt-to-GDP ratio is still lower than other major countries' including the United States with 108 percent, Japan with 237.9 percent and China with 60.9 percent, there have been growing concerns about its rise.             Furthermore, Korea expects a 84 trillion won budget deficit this year due to increased spending while government income — especially from corporate taxes — are expected to decline due to the pandemic.             The size of the fiscal deficit is expected to be equivalent to 6.1 percent of GDP.             When including what are known in Korea as the four social insurances — the national pension fund, health insurance, employment insurance and work-related injury insurance — the deficit is expected to reach 118.6 trillion won.             Last year the government reported a 31.2 trillion won surplus. Including the four social insurances, it registered a 10.6 trillion won deficit.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]         "
381,Moon looks forward to summit with new Japanese leader,"

     Yoshihide Suga, center, stands after being elected Japan's new prime minister in Tokyo on Wednesday. Suga, the new leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was chosen to succeed Shinzo Abe in an extraordinary parliamentary session on Wednesday. [YONHAP]               President Moon Jae-in said Wednesday he is ready for a summit with Japan's new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, to try to mend bilateral ties.             ""President Moon sent a letter to Prime Minister Suga this afternoon to congratulate him on taking office,"" Kang Min-seok, presidential spokesman, said Wednesday. ""Moon expressed his wish to work together to improve Korea-Japan relations during Suga's term.             ""The president is ready to sit down for a summit anytime with his counterpart from Japan, Korea's closest friend culturally and geographically and a neighbor that shares fundamental values and strategic interests,"" Kang continued. ""We hope for a positive response.""             The Korean government hopes Suga and his new cabinet will find reasonable resolutions to thorny historical issues, Kang said. ""We hope to strengthen future-oriented and mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas including the economy, culture and people-to-people exchanges,"" Kang said.             Earlier in the day, Japan's parliament elected Suga as the country's 99th prime minister to succeed Shinzo Abe, who announced his resignation last month. On Monday, Suga was elected the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).             Korea and Japan share a bitter history, including Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of Korea. Enslavement of Korean women in wartime brothels and conscription of forced laborers have been particularly thorny issues.           Bilateral relations have deteriorated since Moon took office and scrapped an agreement to settle the issue of Japan's wartime sexual enslavement of Korean women, signed in 2015 by his predecessor.           The diplomatic chill worsened after the Supreme Court of Korea ruled in 2018 that Japanese companies must pay compensation to individual Korean victims of wartime forced labor. The dispute eventually spilled over to a tit-for-tat trade spat between Seoul and Tokyo. The Moon administration also threatened to withdraw from a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, although it didn't.           Speculation grew that the two leaders could meet in coming months.           Korea is the host of the Korea-China-Japan trilateral summit this year, and Seoul has left open the possibility of holding the event despite the Covid-19 pandemic. If that trilateral summit takes place, Moon and Suga are expected to have a bilateral meeting on the sidelines.           Asked about the trilateral summit, a senior presidential aide said Wednesday that it is premature to talk about it since Suga just took office. ""Please wait and see,"" he said.             Another possibility of a summit between Moon and Suga exists if both attend a Group of 7 (G7) summit in the United States, scheduled to take place after the country's presidential election in November. U.S. President Donald Trump has invited Moon, and Moon has accepted the offer. Japan is also a member of the group.             Rep. Lee Nak-yon, chairman of Korea's ruling Democratic Party (DP), expressed hopes for better Korea-Japan relations. ""I send my congratulations to Prime Minister Suga and the Japanese people,"" Lee said during a party leadership meeting in the morning. ""I wish the best for Japan and hope for an improvement in Korea-Japan relations.""             Suga is expected to follow the polices of his predecessor, Abe. His new cabinet includes many members of the Abe administration, including the foreign minister.             Among the 20 cabinet members, eight ministers from the Abe administration kept their seats, while three were moved to different posts in the Suga cabinet.             Among those retained were Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Aso Taro and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.           Health Minister Kato Katsunobu will become the new chief cabinet secretary.             Joining the cabinet was Nobuo Kishi, younger brother of Abe. He will be the new defense minister.             Criticisms were reported in the Japanese media that Suga, who pledged reform, is relying on many associates of his predecessor and following the factionalism-based politics of the LDP.             Earlier Wednesday, Abe held his final cabinet meeting. Abe served 2,822 days in his second term since Dec. 26, 2012. Including his first term, he served 3,188 days, making him the longest-serving prime minister of Japan.             According to Kang, Moon also sent a letter to Abe to express his warm wishes for a speedy recovery from the ill health that caused him to resign. Abe and his wife had also sent letters to Moon and his wife, Kang said.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "
382,Traveling over Chuseok is a no-go in time of pandemic,"

     Residents of Sangbang Village in Buryang-myeon, Gimje, North Jeolla, wave for the camera Wednesday as they record videos to send their children for the upcoming Chuseok holidays. Several local government offices across the nation are launching special Chuseok programs to virtually connect residents with their children residing in other areas - and encourage them not to meet in person over Chuseok. [NEWS1]         Highway tolls will be charged over the Chuseok holidays this year to nudge people to stay home and prevent a possible spread of the coronavirus, health authorities announced Wednesday.           First Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip relayed in a press briefing that the central government has decided to bypass a recent tradition waiving highway tolls during Chuseok in order to discourage people from visiting their relatives or traveling outside their cities.           Since 2017, highway tolls had been lifted every year during the nation’s two largest holidays - Chuseok and Seollal - to help people reunite with their loved ones and increase spending on domestic tourism.           This year, authorities determined health risks were too high.           The Chuseok holidays, also known as the Korean harvest festival, last three days from Sept. 30 to Oct. 2 this year, but Oct. 3 and 4 are a weekend, which means people will have five days off. Seollal, or Lunar New Year’s Day, is slated for mid-February 2021.           Kim said tolls collected over Chuseok will mainly go toward preventing the spread of the virus, such as disinfecting highway rest areas, where people normally go to eat and use the restrooms.             The health official implored the public not to leave their homes for the holidays, saying Korea was still seeing many traceless Covid-19 patients, which means epidemiologists could not determine where or how they got infected, raising concern of inadvertent transmission.             Kim also stressed the fact that Korea’s daily new cases were still in the triple-digits, which together with the traceless infections, give ample reason why health authorities “have to be extremely concerned” about this year’s Chuseok holidays, when people would normally flock to all corners of the nation.           Korea added 113 new cases of the virus Tuesday, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) revealed Wednesday morning.           Health officials said details of the central government’s so-called Special Prevention Period for the Chuseok holidays will be announced early next week, hinting at “additional” restrictions for popular tourist destinations and businesses where people usually keep short distance from one another, such as hagwon (private cram schools), houses of worship, wedding and funeral halls, movie theaters and fitness centers.             Kim said authorities were currently monitoring nationwide clusters and traceless infections to draw up the new set of rules.           The Special Prevention Period, planned to last for two weeks from Sept. 28, was first mentioned by Health Minister Park Neung-hoo last Sunday as he announced the lifting of the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for the greater Seoul area.             Park said the central government decided to impose extra restrictions on the entire country in time for the Chuseok holidays.                            Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun Wednesday once again urged right-wing civic groups not to rally in Gwanghwamun, downtown Seoul, on Foundation Day on Oct. 3, which is a national holiday, saying it’s “difficult to understand” why they would try to take to the streets again after seeing how a big antigovernment rally held on Aug. 15 Liberation Day in Gwanghwamun led to so many infections.           That cluster is still growing. According to data from the KDCA, 585 people have been traced to the rally cluster as of Wednesday noon, four more than the previous day.           With Chuseok just around the corner, several local governments have launched campaigns to deter nonresidents from visiting their areas and for their residents not to go any place else.             Boseong County in South Jeolla has hung banners across neighborhoods that roughly translate as, “Son, daughter, daughter-in-law, I told you not to come home for Chuseok.”             The Wando County Office in South Jeolla recently launched a program helping elders hold video calls with their children as an alternative to face-to-face interactions. The county office also teamed up with a mowing company to offer special 40-percent discounts to cut weeds around graves so that people outside the county wouldn’t have to visit their ancestors to do the job, often done before or during Chuseok.           In Wanju County, North Jeolla, and Uiseong County, North Gyeongsang, local government officials are planning to record video messages of their elders to send to their kids, and plead with them not to visit for the holidays.             An apartment complex in Wanju launched its own campaign encouraging residents not to invite their children over for Chuseok, and made pickets for elders to hold around the block. On Tuesday morning, some 20 people in their 60s to 80s marched around the neighborhood with signs that roughly translated as, “It’s okay to pause for Chuseok,” “Stay home,” and “Stay in touch while keeping distant.”           Seon Jeong-ran, head of the apartment’s residents’ committee, said it’s all about safety first.           “It’s impossible to erase asymptomatic infections from our everyday lives and society,” said Seon. “That’s why we’ve gathered to encourage others to stay home during Chuseok and adhere to virus preventive measures.”           Wanju’s grassroots movement comes as Korea added 113 new virus cases Tuesday, 105 of which were local infections, according to KDCA data, up from 106 the previous day.            Over the past two weeks, Korea’s daily virus count has hovered between 100 and 200, lower than some 300 to 400 cases that were being recorded in late August, but still not hitting the government’s goal of fewer than 100.           Of Tuesday’s local cases, 49 were in Seoul, 24 in Gyeonggi, eight in Incheon, five in North Jeolla, four each in Busan and Daegu, two each in Gwangju, North Chungcheong, South Chungcheong, North Gyeongsang and Sough Gyeongsang, and one in Daejeon.           Among eight imported cases, two each were from India and the United States, while one each was from Uzbekistan, Hungary, Turkey and Ethiopia.             No patients died Tuesday, leaving total deaths at 367, while 432 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 19,310. As of Tuesday at midnight, Korea had counted 22,504 coronavirus patients in all.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN, JIN CHANG-IL   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
383,DP creates body to investigate its members' scandals,"

     Ruling Democratic Party (DP) Chairman Lee Nak-yon at the party's Supreme Council meeting at the National Assembly in western Seoul on Wednesday. [YONHAP]               The ruling Democratic Party (DP) launched Wednesday an investigative body within the party to probe several scandals of its lawmakers, including Rep. Lee Sang-jik, who has been accused of embezzlement as founder of private airliner Eastar Jet.           “The chairman of the body will be Rep. Choi Ki-sang, who had previous experience as the presiding judge of the Seoul Central District Court and chairman of the national convention of judges,” DP Chairman Lee Nak-yon said during the party’s Supreme Council meeting on Wednesday. “The investigative body will be the DP’s version of the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials [CIO]. It will specifically take on investigations of scandals of public members of the DP, concerning corruption, sexual harassment or other illegalities.”           The CIO has the power to indict Supreme Court justices, the prosecutor general, judges, prosecutors and police officials, preventing the prosecution from being able to protect its own members from criminal charges. Although legislation to establish the CIO was passed last year, the office has not yet been created under the continued boycott by lawmakers from the opposition People Power Party (PPP) that has left the CIO director position vacant.           The DP’s investigation body will not have the authority to take disciplinary action on the lawmakers and members of the party, but it will hand over its investigations to the party's ethics committee, which can take actions including expulsion from the party.           “The DP Supreme Council requested that the body first look into the allegations on Reps. Lee Sang-jik and Kim Hong-gul,” said Choi In-ho, DP spokesman, in a press conference Wednesday.             Rep. Lee Sang-jik, founder of Eastar Jet, was reported to prosecution by its pilot union in July for tax evasion and lying on disclosure forms filed for his National Assembly candidacy.             The union said in a statement that Lee “intentionally omitted assets owned by his wife and children” when he reported his family assets prior to the general elections in April. Eastar Holdings, which owns a 39.6 percent stake in Eastar Jet, is fully owned by Lee’s children — the daughter with 33.3 percent and the son with the remaining 66.7 percent.             The opposition PPP on Sept. 10 also reported Lee to the prosecution for allegedly embezzling funds at Eastar and committing corporate malpractice.           And Kim, the third son of the late President Kim Dae-jung, is embroiled in a real estate scandal.             Kim owns four homes, including the residence of the late President Kim in Donggyo-dong, western Seoul. Kim was supposed to declare four properties when he filed his reports to the National Election Commission (NEC) before the general elections in April. But he didn't include the Godeok-dong apartment.           Kim has denied the allegations, saying he does not manage the wealth himself, so he didn’t know that his wife had purchased the ownership right.           “I hope that the investigative body will be able to conduct independent probes that hold fast to the ethics and regulations laid out in the party’s constitution,” Chairman Lee said during the Supreme Council meeting. “And through this process help the members of the party uphold the highest ethics and moral standards and enhance the public trust in the party.”           Plans to establish the body within the DP were first discussed by lawmakers when late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, a member of the DP, became embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal in July.             Setting up a separate investigation body within the DP was also a campaign pledge of Chairman Lee when he ran for the party’s chairmanship last month.           BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "
384,Pompeo hints that talks with Pyongyang remain ongoing,"

     U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a press conference in June at the State Department in Washington. [AP]               Talks remain underway between North Korea and the United States that could beget opportunity in the future, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted Tuesday.           The remark emerged during an online seminar hosted by the Atlantic Council, in which Pompeo admitted denuclearization negotiations with the regime failed to produce concrete results, despite three high-profile meetings between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.          ""We did have hopes that we could make further progress, that Chairman Kim would go in a different direction, but I'm still optimistic,"" Pompeo said.          ""It's gone quiet publicly, but there's still lots of work going on between ourselves and our allies in the region — the Japanese, the South Koreans — and even efforts with the North Koreans to come to understand where there may be opportunity as time goes on.""           Whether this meant dialogue with Pyongyang remains active is unclear, but speculation has been building for months as to whether the White House may attempt a last-ditch meeting with the North ahead of Trump’s reelection bid in November.             The term ""October surprise,"" used in American politics to refer to deliberately engineered high-profile events meant to sway an election, was used by Trump’s former National Security Adviser John Bolton in July shortly after his inflammatory memoir about the administration grabbed headlines.             The possibility, however, has been denied by North Korea itself, which said in a statement it had no intention to be used as a pawn in U.S. domestic political intrigue.             That belief may be further reinforced by new exposés contained in Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward’s new book “Rage,” which details the process and rationale behind Trump’s decision to break precedence and engage in personal talks with Kim over the last two years.             Trump, Woodward suggests, was much more concerned with the optics of his meetings with Kim and the halt to intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests from the regime they produced rather than the sustainability of the engagements.             There is also little indication that the two sides have narrowed their positions in terms of a denuclearization approach — differences which ultimately consigned Trump and Kim’s second and most critical summit at Hanoi, Vietnam, to failure in February last year.             Meanwhile Pyongyang, as it combats one of the gravest economic crises in recent memory with Covid-19, has been cozying up to its traditional ally in China.             State media reported Wednesday Kim dispatched a congratulatory message to Beijing praising Chinese leader Xi Jinping for “great strategic success” in combating the coronavirus.             “Kim Jong-un expressed his will to do his best to develop, together with the general secretary, the [North Korea]-China friendship, valuable wealth and strategic choice of the two parties and the peoples of the two countries, into a fresh high stage in the joint struggle for defending and glorifying socialism,” read an English-language report from the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).             The flattery, while ceremonial, reflects the North’s growing dependence on foreign aid from Beijing and a vast network of Chinese businesses that is keeping its frail economy afloat amid the pandemic.             A report from a British think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, this month showed that around 150 Chinese businesses were facilitating the regime’s money-laundering operations and access to goods blocked by United Nations sanctions.          BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
385,Kakao Work could change the way you interact in office,"






     Kakao Enterprise CEO Baek Sang-yeop introduces Kakao Work, the messenger app for office groups. [KAKAO]               Ten years after changing the way people communicate in Korea, Kakao launched a messenger service especially for the workplace.           After the original Kakao messenger service replaced mobile text messages as the way people kept in touch, many offices adopted it as a communication tool — one that office workers found hard to avoid.           “Katalk” culture in the office soon got mixed up with private messages on the app. A very common complaint was that Kakao kept people chained to their bosses 24/7.           The new messenger service, named Kakao Work, allows employees to block messages after work. A company can have its own employee data base allowing its employees to message each other without exchanging phone numbers.           The service comes with workplace-oriented features, like checking which members of a group chat did not read a message, or the ability to tap a work request message to add it to a to-do list. It works both on mobile devices and desktop computers.           Employees of Kakao Enterprise, the affiliate that developed business-to-business services, have been testing the Kakao Work messenger since May. The most popular feature was a new emoji function that allows employees to press “Like” on individual messages as they would on Facebook or Instagram.           “In work-related chat rooms, there are situations that require some kind of response, but you’ve already repeated ‘yes’ too many times,” said Baek Sang-yeop, Kakao Enterprise CEO in an online press event, Wednesday. ""This was, in fact, the favorite function for Kakao Enterprise employees.""           Apart from messaging, Kakao Work’s platform will offer tools for companies trying to digitize their way of work — an ongoing trend after the Covid-19 outbreak forced businesses to make employees work from home.           A time clock feature will allow workers to share when they start and finish work, as well as vacation plans. Video meetings are possible on the platform, offering simultaneous connections for up to 30 people. The plan is to gradually expand this number to 200.           That could make Kakao's new app a competitor to other videoconferencing platforms used in Korea, like Zoom.           Collaborative tools that support telecommuters have been on the rise since the coronavirus crisis began. Kakao may not be the first to launch a service in this segment, but one thing the IT giant offers is artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The Kakao Work messenger comes with an AI voice assistant called Kasper, which can answer simple questions. The user only has to input a question in the message box starting with “/Kasper” in Korean.                    A screen capture of Kakao Work's AI assistant Kasper answering the user's question asking for the weather. [KAKAO]         At the moment, Kasper’s knowledge is limited to searching for information. The ultimate goal is to make it into an AI work assistant that can give more specific answers about one's workplace, like automatically adjusting meeting schedules between individuals.           Kakao Work is the first product released by Kakao Enterprise and is part of the company's drive to expand its foothold in business-to-business services. The office messenger is primarily aimed at companies that don't have the resources to set up internal communication tools. Most large companies in Korea develop messenger tools of their own           At the moment, Kakao Work's main functions like video conferencing are offered by the company. But it will also be a platform that other companies can develop functions for.        “As a person working in the IT business for years, I’ve seen a lot of ventures with good ideas on business-to-business services that struggle in the field because they can't find customers,"" Baek said. ""I want Kakao Work to be a platform where more players can expand the service together.""           Kakao Work will offer one basic program for free and three subscription plans equipped with more advanced functions. The “premium” Kakao Work will be offered for free on a trial basis from Wednesday through Nov. 25.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
386,U.S. continues to pressure LG U+ over Huawei links,"

             The United States raised the importance of security in the 5G era during a policy forum with Korea on Sept. 10, again putting pressure on Korean companies partnering with Chinese firms on network technology.           LG U+ is considered the main target of the criticism, as it is the only mobile carrier using 5G equipment made by Huawei.             Local media outlets reported Wednesday that participants from the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce brought up the notion of its policy, dubbed Clean Network, an initiative aimed at keeping Chinese companies out of technological development in the United States and other countries, at the forum held on Sept. 10.           A source at Seoul's Ministry of Science and ICT said the U.S. officials didn’t specifically mention the policy, but broadly touched on the importance of strengthening security for 5G.           “There was no mentioning of the Clean Path or Huawei in the meeting,” said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.           “We shared the importance of building a trusted 5G ecosystem and discussed ways to improve transparency and security in 5G architecture,” he said.           Asked whether the United States tried to put its concerns with Chinese companies’ involvement with Korean companies on the agenda, the source refused to respond, only posing the rhetorical question, “Isn’t it common to have differing opinions in determining a meeting agenda?”           The ICT Ministry’s Director-General Jung Hee-kwon and Stephen C. Anderson, the U.S. acting deputy assistant secretary for international communications and information policy, presided over the meeting.           LG U+ has maintained that the Huawei products it uses conform to international security standards.           This is not the first warning from the United States targeting the mobile carrier.           Robert Strayer, then the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for cyber and international communications and information policy, urged LG U+ to partner with “trusted vendors” instead of the beleaguered Chinese company during a press event in July.           The comment follows remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising SK Telecom and KT as ""clean carriers"" in June.           The source said that at the forum the United States also expressed concerns over an enforcement decree designed to hold large content providers like Netflix, Naver and YouTube accountable for maintaining network quality.           Anyone violating the rule will be fined 20 million won ($16,900).           “The U.S. voiced concern, citing the burden [on U.S. companies],” the source said.           The decree will be passed into law after a 40-day pre-announcement period that started on Sept. 9 and deliberation at the National Assembly.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

[SK TELECOM]               SK Telecom has launched a subscription service for cloud-based games in partnership with Microsoft, adding the Korean market to a global test to see if gaming streaming services can enter the mainstream.           Korea is one of 22 countries, and the only one in Asia, to launch the service starting Tuesday.           Priced at 16,700 won ($14.20) per month, the SKT 5GX Cloud Game service will allow users to access more than 100 titles from Microsoft’s Xbox catalog, including Forza Horizon 4, Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Black Desert.           Subscribers won't need to buy a console to play the games — just a supported Android device and a controller, SK Telecom said.           Subscribers can choose to buy a package including the supported controller for 22,000 won per month on a 12-month payment plan.           Though the 5G network is the best fit for the service, the telecom unit said that 4G LTE users and those from other wireless carriers can be enrolled in the service.           Ryu Young-sang, president of the mobile network operator division at SK Telecom, said that it aims to hit 1 million subscribers by 2023, adding that now is the turn for gaming streaming services to take off, following success stories in the music and movie sectors.           He also went on to note that the introduction of the 5G network could boost the appeal of the service, which requires high network speeds and low latency.           “With SKT 5GX Cloud Game powered by the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, we will realize a new level of experience for users of 5G-based cloud gaming in Korea,"" Ryu said. “We will continue to expand the cloud game ecosystem by discovering and supporting promising games in Korea.”           The telecom unit and Microsoft jointly operated a beta version of the service for one year with tens of thousands of players testing the service.             “With cloud gaming now a key part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, we’re excited for gamers in Korea and across the world to have more freedom in the way they play with friends and family,"" said Phil Spencer, head of Xbox at Microsoft. “We’re excited to continue our work with SKT and look forward to delivering a fantastic gaming experience to the Korean gaming community.”           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
388,"Secretary confided mayor's harassment to colleague who later raped her, lawyer says","

     Seoul City Hall in Jung District, central Seoul. [YONHAP]          The lawyer representing a former secretary to the late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon told the JoongAng Ilbo she was raped by a colleague in whom she had confided about Park’s alleged sexual advances.           The lawyer, Kim Jae-ryon, told the paper in an exclusive interview Monday that the victim told the alleged rape suspect via text message she was having a hard time at work due to Park, and that she felt “uncomfortable” about the mayor sending her selfies.            But the male colleague didn’t take it seriously, Kim said, and he began mocking her with the nickname “the mistress of the sixth floor” in front of other coworkers at City Hall, saying the mayor “loves” her.           The sixth floor is where Park’s office and those of his secretaries were located.             Kim said the victim felt “very uncomfortable” about the moniker but couldn’t raise her accusations against Park in a more assertive manner. Most of her colleagues on the sixth floor who were aware of her struggle collectively thought of her relationship with Park as harmless, as that of “a grandmother and her granddaughter.”           On April 13, the eve of the general elections, Kim said the suspect invited the victim — who by that time was working on a different team within the Seoul city government — to a dinner joined by former and current secretaries.            Kim said the suspect forced the victim to drink several shots of liquor that was more than 40 percent alcohol as “punishment for being late.” The victim became drunk, after which the suspect took her to a motel in Seocho District, southern Seoul, where he allegedly raped her, Kim continued.           The victim called the cops after she went home, and police launched an investigation soon thereafter. The suspect was suspended by the city government on April 24, 11 days later.           On Sept. 10, Seoul prosecutors indicted him on charges of “quasi-rape” and inflicting physical harm during the process.             Korea’s criminal code defines quasi-rape as the act of having sexual intercourse with another person by taking advantage of his or her condition of unconsciousness or inability to resist. A conviction carries a minimum sentence of three years in prison.             The suspect has never publicly provided his side of the story, but a Seoul city government official with knowledge of the case told the JoongAng Ilbo Monday that he denies the rape and says he left the motel that night after the woman refused to have sex with him.           BY HEO JEONG-WON   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

390,North's SLBM test barge gone in possible precursor to test: 38 North,"

                  Satellite imagery has shown that a submersible barge used to test a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) disappeared from the North's main submarine shipyard — a possible sign that an SLBM test may be impending, according to a U.S. think tank.           The monitoring website 38 North made the assessment based on satellite imagery of the North's Sinpo shipyard amid speculation that the regime could test-fire an SLBM around the 75th anniversary of the founding of the country's ruling Workers' Party on Oct. 10.           ""Commercial satellite imagery of North Korea's Sinpo South Shipyard from Sept. 15 indicates heavy activity has taken place over the past week since the typhoons have passed, including the repositioning of the Sinpo-class submarine and the repositioning or departure of the submersible test barge,"" 38 North said.           ""The submersible test barge, usually berthed to the north of the protective awning, was gone, and the small probable mini-submarine, which had been positioned on the quay since May 27, had been removed,"" it said.           The think tank said the barge may have been moved ahead of the new submarine or pulled from the water to undergo repairs, citing a recent media report of damage to vessels in the shipyard.           ""If the object berthed ahead of the Sinpo-class submarine is not the submersible test barge, then the barge's whereabouts may signal an impending SLBM test, although conducting such a launch on the heels of a destructive typhoon seems unlikely,"" it said.           An SLBM test has been considered one of the provocative acts that the North could undertake, after leader Kim Jong-un pledged to show off a new strategic weapon in his New Year's Day message.           South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Chairman nominee Gen. Won In-choul said Wednesday North Korea could test-fire an SLBM around the party anniversary on Oct. 10.           Yonhap         "

     The Yogiyo app, which allows for ordering from the Yomart dark store. [DELIVERY HERO KOREA]               Delivery Hero Korea is jumping on the ""dark store"" bandwagon, opening a Yomart on Wednesday.            Dark stores look like supermarkets, but are for the delivery and collection of online orders.           Berlin's Delivery Hero Korea, which operates Yogiyo, announced Wednesday that the first Yomart opened in Gangnam, southern Seoul.           It is similar to B Mart, a Woowa Brothers dark store opened in November. Woowa Brothers operates Baedal Minjok.           Around 3,000 products can be purchased at Yomart via the Yogiyo app and are available within 30 minutes. Using Yomart adds 3,000 won ($2.55) to each order.             Fresh produce, meal-kit packages, household items and pet supplies are among the offerings.             Delivery Hero Korea plans to open more Yomart stores after it completes the test run of the Gangnam location.             The company is providing a “next-generation delivery service that can get any products to customers within 30 minutes, which is beyond next-day delivery, dawn delivery or three-hour delivery,” Delivery Hero Korea wrote in a statement.             Outside of Korea, Yomart is known as DMart.           “Globally, DMart is growing rapidly through the provision of a range of products and quick delivery to its users,” said Kim So-jung, Delivery Hero Stores Korea CEO, in a statement.              Customers purchasing more that 10,000 won worth of goods from Yomart can get free delivery this month.           Many retailers have dark stores, targeting individual households ordering in small quantities.

392,SK E&S named preferred bidder for Saemangeum Project,"

     A bird’s-eye view of the start-up cluster SK E&S plans to develop in North Jeolla as part of the Saemangeum Project. [SK E&S]               SK E&S has been selected as preferred bidder for a government project that would see it building a range of facilities and managing a floating solar power plant on Korea's west coast.          The project is led by Saemangeum Development and Investment Agency (SDIA), a government agency that is part of a larger project to develop a new economic hub on the west coast.           SK E&S, the energy affiliate of SK Group, said Wednesday that it was named preferred bidder to build facilities and operate a 200-megawatt floating solar power plant, part of a larger 2.4-gigawatt facility planned by SDIA.           “If SK E&S receives the order for this project, it will become the largest [provider of] floating solar power plants [by capacity] among private companies,” wrote SK E&S in a statement.           Saemangeum, which roughly translates to “bringing riches and prosperity,” refers to the central west coast of Korea, including Buan, Gimje and Gunsan in North Jeolla.           Early last year, the SDIA announced that it would provide incentives, including offering contracts, to businesses that invest in the Saemangeum Project. Four businesses have been selected, including SK E&S.           In the bidding that took place on Tuesday, SK E&S won the contract to develop the Saemangeum areas by demonstrating its idea of building a data center and investing in a start-up cluster. Winning the contract to build facilities and operate the floating solar power plants is in part thanks to the attractiveness of the overall pitch to develop the Saemangeum area.           SK E&S said it will contribute to making Saemangeum turn into a hub of future industries like Almere, a planned city in the province of Flevoland in the Netherlands.           Almere is known as a self-sufficient city, with 5,000 new jobs created every year.           Similar to Almere, SK E&S hopes to vitalize the local economy by creating quality jobs and a start-up cluster. In the long-term, it plans to build a data center that uses the electricity generated from the Saemangeum project, which it hopes will attract domestic and international IT companies.            Specifically, SK E&S plans to invest 100 billion won ($85 million) into creating the start-up cluster, which it expects will attract high profile companies.           SK E&S said it plans to operate facilities that can generate 5 gigawatts of renewable energy in Korea by 2030. It currently operates renewable energy facilities that can generate 110 megawatts of energy in Korea. Solar energy accounts for 47 megawatts of the company’s total energy generation capacity.           “Companies face a situation where they aren’t guaranteed survival without a pre-emptive response to climate change and carbon emissions,” said SK E&S President Yu Jeong-joon. “Based on this project, [SK E&S] will contribute not just to leading the supply of clean energy, but also to the local economy.”           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleHanwha Q Cells to build Portuguese solar power plantLocals worry solar power plants are causing landslides"
393,"In first DMZ visit, unification minister praises Comprehensive Military Agreement","

     Unification Minister Lee In-young, third from left, visits the truce village of Panmunjom in the inter-Korean demilitarized zone on Wednesday. [JOINT PRESS CORPS]               Minister of Unification Lee In-young credited North Korea for attempting to honor an all-but-defunct inter-Korean military agreement from two years ago in his first visit to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) on Wednesday.           The visit, which came on the eve of the second anniversary of the Sept. 19 military agreement signed between the two Koreas, was meant to reinforce South Korea’s pledge to uphold peace-seeking measures enshrined in the deal, according to the ministry.          Crediting the agreement for relaxing intense tensions that almost reignited hostilities between the two countries in 2017, Lee called the military pact “worthy of high praise” for bringing about a failsafe against potential military conflict on the peninsula.          The Comprehensive Military Agreement was signed by military chiefs of the two Koreas at the third inter-Korean summit at Pyongyang in September 2018. It stipulates that both sides will halt any acts of mutual military hostility, and calls for a gradual disarmament of the heavily fortified DMZ and its neighboring waters.             But as relations faltered between the two Koreas along with the North’s denuclearization talks with Washington, Pyongyang appeared to renege on the agreement by conducting weapons tests near the border while criticizing Seoul for kowtowing to the United States.             In June, the peninsula was plunged into crisis once again after Pyongyang unilaterally demolished an inter-Korean liaison office in their border city of Kaesong — the most lasting result of the two-year rapprochement.          Lee, who was brought in by the Moon administration to salvage inter-Korean ties, said Wednesday that Seoul was continuing efforts to implement the agreement to its full.          Adjustments were made to the South’s joint military drills with the United States, while a legislative process is ongoing to resolve the issue of anti-Pyongyang leaflets, Lee said, referring to South Korean activists’ unauthorized dispatch of propaganda across the border which prompted the North’s escalating aggression in June.             Whether the destruction of the liaison office constituted a breach of the Sept. 19 agreement was a point of contention in Seoul, with Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo saying the two were unrelated.             Lee noted the demolition of the office, which had been left vacant for months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, was “certainly a very regrettable act,” but added that Kim Jong-un “made an effort to prevent further escalation of tensions” with his subsequent order to suspend military action plans against South Korea.             Pyongyang dialed back its hostility with the order, promptly withdrawing loudspeakers it had set up at the DMZ that same week to blast propaganda broadcasts across to the South.             Such acts, Lee said, showed North Korea had attempted to respect the September military agreement — a rosy assessment, given how bare inter-Korean dialogue has been since June.             Rehashing his numerous earlier pledges, Lee pledged to restore ties through his signature “small-scale approach,” which he said would include humanitarian exchanges in the fields of public health or the environment once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided.             “I hope the North too responds for the sake of implementing the promise between our two leaders made in the inter-Korean joint statement,” he said.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

[YONHAP]                The ruling party on Wednesday suspended the party membership of Rep. Yoon Mee-hyang, who became a proportional lawmaker based on her career of supporting survivors of Japan’s wartime sexual slavery, after she was charged with exploiting at least one of the victims.             The Supreme Council of the Democratic Party (DP) held a meeting in the morning and approved the suspension of Yoon’s party membership.            “The party takes seriously the prosecution’s indictment against Rep. Yoon and we offer an apology,” Rep. Choi In-ho, chief spokesman of the DP, said Wednesday. “We will suspend her from serving on party posts and exercising her membership of the party. The party will take further action based on the court’s judgment.”           The Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday indicted Yoon, former head of the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, on eight charges including fraud, embezzlement and breach of trust.             In May, Lee Yong-soo, a comfort woman survivor and longtime activist for the victims, held a press conference and accused Yoon of having exploited her and other survivors for decades. The prosecution launched a probe later that month, but Yoon denied all charges and started her four-year lawmaker term.             Among the charges Yoon was indicted for is a count of quasi-fraud against Gil Won-ok, a 92-year-old survivor. The prosecution said Gil suffers from dementia and that Yoon had exploited her reduced physical and mental capacities and pressed her to donate a total of 79.2 million won ($67,102) to the Korean Council between November 2017 and January this year.           Yoon has maintained her innocence. She accused prosecutors of having disgraced Gil by treating her as if she is incapable of making her own decisions.             The prosecution, however, told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday that a prosecutor had met and interviewed Gil during the probe. Medical professionals also offered opinions to conclude that Gil was physically and mentally unfit to make her own decisions when she made the donations.             On Tuesday, DP Chairman Lee Nak-yon made clear that Yoon's fate will be decided based on the party's constitution and regulations, starting a process to remove her from party affairs. DP Secretary General, Rep. Park Kwang-on, subsequently suspended her from serving on any in-house posts. She had served on the party’s central committee, national delegation and other positions.             The constitution and regulations of the DP allow the secretary general to suspend a party member who is indicted for a corruption charge such as graft. The secretary general also has power to invoke a disciplinary process against the member.             If the indicted party member receives a criminal conviction that includes imprisonment, he or she will face expulsion.              BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "
395,Disney's 'Mulan' faces greatest challenge yet — a call for a boycott,"

     The main poster for Disney's live-action film ""Mulan."" [WALT DISNEY COMAPNY KOREA]                “I do not wish to see a film where a lead actor supports the brutality of the Hong Kong police force.”           “We need to boycott ‘Mulan’ and show Disney an audience that puts forward basic human rights and to not be an accomplice to autocracy.”             “I really wanted to see Mulan... But after seeing [the news] that the credits thank the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, I changed my mind: I’m never going to see the film.”           These are just some of the comments written in Korean that can be found on social media when searching the hashtag “boycott Mulan.”                A tweet from a local user claiming they will not see the film. [TWITTER]                Controversy surrounding Disney’s live-action film “Mulan” is snowballing to the point of a global boycott against the film despite it being one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. A remake of the 1998 animated film with the same title, it is one of the company’s all-time favorites as it centers around the transformation of a young girl in ancient China who becomes a warrior to protect her family.            After facing multiple delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the film was finally released on Disney+ in the United States on Sept. 4 and is hitting global theaters which do not have access to the streaming platform.                 Controversies and global response             The boycott movement was ignited when the lead actor Liu Yifei, a naturalized U.S. citizen, shared a Weibo post last year from the Beijing newspaper People’s Daily, supporting Hong Kong’s police force against protesters fighting for democracy after Hong Kong’s extradition law was put forward. In the post, the actor wrote in Chinese, “I also support Hong Kong Police. You can beat me up now,” and also added in English, “What a shame for Hong Kong.”          A tweet by Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong urging people to boycott the film. [TWITTER]                Pro-democracy activists, such as Joshua Wong who rose to prominence for his role in Hong Kong's so-called Umbrella Movement in 2014, have urged global audiences who “believe in human rights” to boycott the film. The movement is spreading quickly via social media, with activists in Thailand and Taiwan coming up with their own hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance, to show their support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.             Another, bigger backlash hit the film when credits gave special thanks to several government entities in Xinjiang, including the “Publicity Department of CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee” for allowing parts of the film to be shot in the region.             According to CNN reports, approximately 2 million Uyghur people are said to be detained in prison camps in Xinjiang where they are “subjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical, and sexual abuse, forced labor and death.”             As well as outrage online, a group of Republican senators made an official inquiry addressed to Disney CEO Bob Chapek last week concerning “security and propaganda” related to the authorities in Xinjiang with the production of Mulan.             In the letter, the lawmakers ask the company to specifically address the requests and demands made by the Xinjiang government entities listed in the credits, and question how aware the company was of the cultural genocide happening within the region, as well as whether or not there was any usage of forced labor regarding the film production.             In addition, reviews criticize that the film lacks an overall understanding of Chinese culture and also points out the lack of Asian talent behind the cameras despite the all-Asian cast. Neither the director, screenwriters or any of the costume designers are of Chinese descent.                 Proven by the numbers?             Disney’s prior live-action films, for the most part, have been received positively in Korea. In fact, it’s no secret that local audiences are extremely lenient when it comes to such films, eager to see their favorite childhood animations played out by real characters. The best example being “Aladdin” (2019) which topped the weekend box office for weeks on end and reaped more than 12 million ticket sales. The film currently sits at No. 11 on the list of most-watched films, according to Korean Film Council data.           But just as the company targets adults in their 20s and 30s who grew up watching animated films, the impact of the boycott may be felt the most in these age groups who are most media sensitive.             “The mainstream audience who visit the cinemas are those in their 20s and 30s,” said Lee Taek-gwang, a professor of the School of Global Communication at Kyung Hee University. “And especially the latter now come hand-in-hand with their children to see these films. Our generation has pride in the fact that the country succeeded in democratization, so it’s highly likely that the people will participate in the boycott movement.             “Young children may see the film via streaming services, but in box office sales, the result may not be as high as [Disney] expected,” Lee added.                Multiple civil rights organization, led by ’The Declaration of Global Citizen,“ stage an official protest on July 1 in front of the Walt Disney Company Korea building in Gangnam District in southern Seoul to boycott Disney’s ’Mulan“after lead actor Liu Yifei voiced her support for the Hong Kong police’s suppression of pro-democracy movements. [YONHAP]                Some have taken action offline. The Declaration of Global Citizen, a civil rights organization, staged an official protest in front of the Walt Disney Company Korea building in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, in July to support the global boycott movement.             “Whether it’s about Hong Kong democratization or boycotting Mulan, they’re all of universal matter,” Park Do-hyung, co-representative of The Declaration of Global Citizen told the Korea JoongAng Daily when asked why Korea should participate in boycotting the film. “Hong Kong’s democratic movements are not irrelevant to our country. We should stand together to show our solidarity as we are all universally connected [in our beliefs].”             Park said that their requests sent to three major multiplex chains— CGV, Lotte Cinema and Megabox— to prohibit the screening of films have gone unanswered.             “But we are still planning to install props and host one-person demonstrations to show that [our stance stands firm],” Park said.             Culture critic Ha Jae-geun, on the other hand, forecasts that the boycott movement alone won’t determine whether or not the film will be a success or a flop.             “Of course, due to the global movement, its effect will trickle over to local box office sales,” Ha analyzed. “But if the film is worthy of becoming a hit, it may not be a determining factor. However, as people continue to access news of Hong Kong, democratization, human rights, I believe there will be more people who wouldn’t want to see the film [anymore] than vice versa.”           The film premieres in local theaters on Thursday.             BY LEE JAE-LIM  [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]           "

400,The traveling grandma who's 'alive and kicking it',"

                           Documentary filmmaker Jung Hyung-min, right, and his mother Lee Chun-suk, at Mount Kailash, Tibet. [JINJIN PICTURES]                 An 80-year-old grandmother is probably not the first travel companion that springs to mind, but for filmmaker Jung Hyung-min, his dream was to go on an expedition with his elderly mother.            “When my mom leaves this world, I want her to go away with a smile without sorrow for my father and my older brother who passed away early. If she spends her whole life staying at home, I think she may leave with all that sadness within her. So there was no choice but to go on a trip with her,” said 51-year-old director Jung during a recent interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily.                Jung, left, and Lee pose for an interview at the ibis Ambassador Seoul in Insa-dong, Jongno District, central Seoul. [KWON HYUK-JAE]                Jung’s mother, Lee Chun-suk, 86, lost her son less than a year after his birth. And the misfortune didn’t stop there. Her husband left her in 1970, after seven years of marriage. Lee was left to raise two children by herself and spent the next 40 years dedicating her life to motherhood.            However, one day Lee became curious about a 600-year-old Buddhist temple located in Kagbeni of the Himalayas.               From this curiosity, the journey of the mother and son started. On her way back home from the Himalayas, the mother asked, “What is our next destination?”           Jung and Lee's first trip was filmed for the 2017 documentary film “The Way to Mustang.” Jung’s most recent film “Journey to Kailash,” which was released on Sept. 3, follows the three-month-long voyage of the unlikely duo that included stops by Lake Baikal, Ulaanbaatar of Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, Pamir Plateau and Mount Kailash in Tibet. The total length of the road Jung and Lee traveled was 20,000 kilometers (12,427 miles).           Thanks to her son, Lee became an explorer at the age of 80. She celebrated her 84th birthday at the Pamir Plateau that sits 5,000 meters above sea level. On her birthday, she wrote in her journal, “When can I come here again? I’m the happiest granny in the world. I’m 84 but I’m still alive and kicking.”             Lee’s humor and positive energy are the driving forces behind the 89-minute-long documentary from the opening until the end.           “If I knew [the trip] would become a film, then I would have paid more attention to the way I looked,” said Lee with a laugh. “The lead actor is not good but Jung did a good job as a director,” she added.           Lee struggled to raise her children as a single mother. She considered going on a trip as a luxury that she couldn’t afford. Despite Jung asking his mom to accompany him on several trips, Lee always turned down his offers. But after watching some travel documentaries and seeing her own son's trips, Lee finally decided to take the plunge.             People were wary and tried to dissuade Jung, but he knew his mother was strong enough for the trip.            “She was able to drag toppled trees from the mountain and chop them up with an axe. Our four-year journey from the Himalayas to the highlands of Tibet was a kind of warm-up period for my mother to adjust to the altitude. I thought she would be fine and she was actually fine,” said Jung.             In the “Journey to Kailash,” the duo become friends with strangers they meet along the road with ease. Sometimes, Lee hosts a Korean language class on a whim for the kids she comes across.                 Lee at Lake Baikal in Russia. [JINJIN PICTURES]        Lee on the Altai Mountains. [JINJIN PICTURES]               When asked how she communicates with children so well despite the language barrier, Lee said “They are far from being affluent but I could feel their friendliness from their eyes."" Jung added his thoughts on the question by saying, “The people there were good-natured, so they welcomed my mom with open arms.”             The way Lee appreciates the little things she encounters on the road — such as an old tree losing its bark or a goat climbing on a rocky mountain — makes viewers reflect on their own lives. Lee takes nothing for granted.               She often mumbles her prayers by holding Buddhist prayer beads in one hand. Her prayers are “Please don’t make them starve” or “Please make every human being in sorrow happy, Buddha!”             Lee’s prayers sound sincere because she’s been through her own pain and suffering.             “I remember my mom was busy selling instant noodles to high school students at a greasy spoon. She worked hard. I later realized my mom was a promising civil servant while young,” said Jung.             Lee was born in 1934, the second child of seven children. Her parents were eager to educate their children whether they were boys or girls, unlike other traditional Korean parents. Back then, most girls barely finished elementary school but Lee went on to high school and graduated from Soodo Women Teachers' College, an archetype of Sejong University.                 Lee, right, and her husband Jung Seong-du. [JINJIN PICTURES]       Lee, center, when she was working as a civil servant in Jinyang, South Gyeongsang. [JINJIN PICTURES]                After graduation, Lee became the first female civil servant in 1956 at the age of 22 after a 12-to-1 competition and secured a spot at an agricultural technology center in Jinyang, South Gyeongsang.             Lee used to teach hangul (Korean alphabet) to children in rural areas whenever she had off time.             She got married at the age of 30. Her husband used to work at the Bank of Korea in Seoul but returned home because he wanted to stay close to the southern coast where he grew up.           After her husband passed away, Lee kept working in the public sector for about 10 years but eventually quit for her son.       “My grandmother who lived in Seoul took care of me. My mom came to Seoul once a month to see me but I cried hard whenever I had to say goodbye to her. It made her quit. Since then, she did any given job to raise us. But she regrets her decision from time to time. She says if she kept working, she could have helped me more.”             Lee settled down in Bonghwa, North Gyeongsang in 2008 and has been living in a house built by Jung. Lee spends most of her time taking care of her garden. She wakes up at 5 a.m., enjoys meditating and loves talking to flowers and trees.             “I recently planted more than 100 sweet pumpkins in my garden, but a wild boar ate nearly half of the pumpkins. I got so mad and cried but my son said I’d better sympathize with the hungry boar,” said Lee. “He took the boar's side and not mine,” Lee added, staring at Jung.             Despite the disagreement over the pumpkin-eating boar, it was obvious throughout the interview how proud Lee is of her son.              “Before I conceived him, I had a dream and there was a child who was carrying a globe. I wanted him to become an anthropologist and was surprised to see him become a documentary filmmaker,” said Lee.             Jung graduated from Kyungpook National University and went abroad to study cultural anthropology at McMaster University in Canada. While he was on a doctorate course, the Sept. 11 attack took place. Various social conflicts including the Afghanistan refugee issue moved Jung. He thought that he needed to work on something other than learning at school, so he flew back home.             He first translated TV documentaries and filmed his own trip to the Himalayas in 2011.            “I’m currently working as a part-time lecturer at the department of archaeology and anthropology at my home university as my mom wished. I also came to film the lives of Alaskan natives for the first time among local TV documentary filmmakers. I want to keep presenting the lives and traditions of people who live in extreme areas of the world,” said Jung.             Jung and Lee are currently stuck due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the pair wishes to visit Bodh Gaya in northern India, which is believed to be the poorest city in the world.             In the hope of handing out rice and blankets to people living there when they finally do make their trip, Lee saves between 200,000 won ($168.9) and 300,000 won every month from her pension.             “If I had gone to these remote places earlier, I would have installed more water pipes in more neighborhoods. Until the day I die, I hope to install water pipes so that children can access clean water,” said Lee.           “Even if I die, I want my son to continue my legacy. That’s my wish.”             BY NA WON-JEONG   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]     "

402,Lottery sales hit record in the first half ,"

     A person is checking their Lotto lottery ticket with the winning numbers. [YONHAP]                Lottery sales hit an all-time high in the first half possibly due to the economic impact of the pandemic.           The sale of lottery products increased on year by 11.1 percent to reach 2.6 trillion won ($2.2 billion) through the end of June, according to data released Wednesday by the Lottery Commission, which is under the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This is the largest won amount sold since the commission started compiling related data in 2005.             It is the steepest first-half increase since 2017, when sales rose by 17.7 percent on year.             The lottery was introduced in Korea in 2004.           Lottery products normally sell well during times of economic weakness. The sales results could mean that more people were betting on the chance to hit the jackpot to help them through the pandemic recession.             By category, Lotto sales hit 2.38 trillion won, scratch-off lottery tickets sales came in at 186.3 billion won and internet lottery sales were 40.8 billion won. In the Lotto category, individuals pick numbers and the winning numbers are chosen at random.             Sales of pension-type lottery tickets rose 68.2 percent, with 85.5-billion-won worth sold in the first half. That is the most since records were first compiled in 2012.             Introduced in 2011, the pension-type lottery gives the winner a fixed amount of money over a 10 to 20-year period. The monthly prize for winners was increased in April from 5 million won to 7 million won.             The game was immensely popular in 2012 when it first came out, with sales reaching 100 billion won, but it steadily declined as gamblers seem to prefer the chance for a big prize.           The Lottery Commission believes that the increase of the payout for the pension-type lottery could be helping sales.           Profits from the sale of tickets hit 1.72 trillion won, up 9.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. It is the first time Lottery Commission profits broke 1 trillion won in the first half. Money raised goes to the Lottery Fund, which supports low-income families, independence fighters and welfare programs.           BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

405,Yoon pushes back on charges of exploiting 'comfort woman',"

     Rep. Yoon Mee-hyang of the Democratic Party (DP) attends a meeting of the National Assembly's Environment and Labor Committee on Tuesday.  [YONHAP]                Rep. Yoon Mee-hyang of the ruling party, a renowned activist for survivors of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, responded to prosecutors' charges that she exploited one of the survivors by posting several video clips of the woman to her Facebook account Monday night.           Yoon, the former head of the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, attempted to challenge the prosecution’s allegation that she took advantage of a survivor by highlighting the woman's speech during an earlier rally.             The Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office on Monday indicted the Democratic Party (DP) lawmaker on eight charges including fraud, embezzlement and breach of trust. She has been the subject of intense scrutiny since May, after Lee Yong-soo, a survivor and longtime activist for the victims, accused Yoon of exploiting her and other survivors for decades.           Among Monday's charges was a count of quasi-fraud against Gil Won-ok, a 92-year-old survivor. The prosecution said Gil suffers from dementia and that Yoon had exploited her physical and mental weakness and pressed her to donate a total of 79.2 million won ($67,102) to the Korean Council between November 2017 and January this year.              In this file photo, Gil Won-ok, a comfort woman survivor, talks during a public rally demanding Japan's apology on Aug. 14, 2019.  [YONHAP]               In an apparent attempt to refute the prosecution’s argument that Gil has dementia, Yoon on Monday night posted three videos of Gil giving speeches during rallies.             “Why am I suddenly sharing videos of Gil from 2017 to 2020? Because I want to remember her life with my friends as the prosecution denied her confident, great life as an activist for peace and human rights,” she wrote in a Facebook post.             Early Tuesday morning, however, she had deleted two of the three videos without any explanation.             After the prosecution indicted her on Monday, Yoon issued a statement maintaining her innocence in all charges. She accused the prosecutors of insulting Gil by treating her as a victim with mental and physical weakness. Yoon said Gil willingly donated the money to her civic group.             According to the prosecution, the Korean Council initiated a public donation campaign to pay money to survivors who refused to receive compensation from Japan under a controversial settlement agreement between Seoul and Tokyo. Gil received 100 million won of the donated money in November 2017 and donated 50 million won of it to the Korean Council.             Gil subsequently donated another 29.2 million won to the Korean Council through this January. The prosecution said Sohn Young-mi, a Korean Council official who committed suicide on June 6, also conspired in deceiving Gil to make donations.             Since 2012, Gil has lived in a shelter operated by the Korean Council. Sohn was the caretaker of the facility. Gil left the shelter on June 11 to live with her family after Sohn’s death.             Gil’s family on Tuesday rejected Yoon’s claim that Gil willingly donated the money.             “Yoon initiated a fundraising campaign and paid the money to an elderly survivor. Yoon, then, made her donate the money to the Korean Council,” the wife of Gil’s adopted son told the JoongAng Ilbo on Tuesday. “It is a strange donation.”             According to her, Gil has been taking medicine for dementia since 2015. The prosecution said it concluded that her cognitive and judgmental abilities were impaired for a long time based on medical records and the opinions of medical professionals.             The daughter-in-law also said Gil’s condition has deteriorated to the extent that she doesn’t even remember who Yoon is.           “I guess it is fortunate that she does not remember her,” the daughter-in-law said, adding that the family is grateful that the prosecution has investigated the case.             Meanwhile, the Korean Council issued a statement on Tuesday and criticized the prosecution. When prosecutors indicted Yoon on Monday, they also indicted an unnamed senior official of the civic group as Yoon’s co-conspirator.           The civic group accused the prosecution of attempting to tarnish the survivors and their activities.           “We express strong regret that the prosecution treated a lofty act by a survivor as the act of an old lady with dementia,” it said.             While the Korean Council defended Yoon, the DP leadership has remained silent about Yoon’s indictment. Following the indictment, Yoon said she will step down from all party posts and will not exercise her right to participate in DP affairs.            BY KWON HYE-RIM, SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "
406,"U.S. sanctions could cripple Huawei, help Samsung","






     Strengthened sanctions by the United States on Huawei took effect Tuesday. Foreign semiconductor manufacturers are now banned from selling products to Huawei that are based on U.S. machinery or technology. [NEWS1]               A new set of U.S. sanctions on Huawei went into effect Tuesday, which restricts foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips that use U.S. technology to the company. Korean technology firms are expected to suffer in the short term, but will likely benefit later.           The new sanctions were announced in August. Foreign chip makers need to obtain a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce to sell chips to the Shenzhen-based technology firm.            Last year, Huawei bought 13 trillion won ($11 billion) worth of products manufactured in Korea, many of them chips. The cumulative amount over the past five years is close to 40 trillion won.            In the long term, however, Korean firms are likely to benefit from the overall squeeze on Huawei. If Huawei is forced out of the smartphone market, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics will get some of its market share. Samsung has recently started targeting the telecommunications market, which Huawei dominates with its 5G gear and network technology.            The prospect of Samsung getting an increased share of the smartphone market was reflected in the 11.85 percent increase in its stock price, which rose to 60,000 won for the first time in seven months on Sept. 14.                            The violation of U.S. sanctions can be costly to any company, even if by mistake. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, a sanctions violation can be punished with jail time up to 20 years and a fine of $1 million — plus the value of the transaction multiplied by two.           Becoming a target of the United States is one of the most dangerous things to happen to a company. Chinese telecommunications company ZTE is close to bankruptcy after being accused of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran, and ultimately pleading guilty in March 2017. The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed a ban in April 2018 on U.S. companies selling equipment to the Chinese telecom giant. The sanctions were lifted in July 2018.            “Companies should temporarily stop exports or re-exports if they cannot determine whether or not they are violating the sanctions,” warned Rhee Soo-mi, a partner at U.S. law firm Arnold & Porter.             Industry analysts say Huawei will attempt to weather the crisis — at least until its current inventory of essential smartphone parts runs out. Huawei developed its own smartphone operating system, Hongmeng, instead of relying on Google's Android. However, it is virtually impossible for the company to produce smartphones and other telecom devices without semiconductors and displays based on U.S. technology.           According to the Financial Times, Huawei has basically been given a death sentence.            China has yet to announce its response to the U.S. sanctions on Huawei. Analysts say that the Xi Jinping administration is hesitant to fight back and escalate the trade war with the United States. But Beijing is trying to sway public opinion through state-run media.            “Even if the hawkish population in the U.S. attempts to sever the economic and trade ties between U.S. and China, they cannot eliminate the deep-rooted interdependence between both nations,” read a column published Sept. 10 in the Global Times, an English-language newspaper under the state-run People’s Daily. A column published on Sept. 5 warned that China could sell all the U.S. government bonds it possesses.            BY KIM TAE-YUN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
407,Utility bills and rents to be cut for some smaller businesses ,"

     Gas meters affixed to the wall of a building in Dongdaemun District, eastern Seoul. [NEWS1]               Electricity and gas bills are to be suspended for small businesses and rents will be discounted for some to help them survive the pandemic.           Businesses operating in government-owned industrial complexes and in spaces leased from public institutions will get up to 100 percent of their rent waived, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Tuesday.           Any business struggling to pay its electricity or gas bills can either extend their payment date or switch payment plans from Sept. 21.             Those that meet the legal definition of a small business can apply for a suspension of their electricity and gas bill due dates. Individuals already receiving a discount on their gas and electricity bills are also qualified. This includes people living on basic living benefits, severely disabled people, independence patriots, multi-child households and low-income families.            Gas bills due September through December can be paid three months later. In the three-month period, the 2 percent late fee is waived. After three months, individuals can pay in installments until June next year so they are not hit with one big bill.           Payment plans for gas can be changed through the call centers of the Korea Gas Corporation and via its website from Sept. 21 through Dec. 31. Applications must be submitted before the due date for the bills. Households with payments due before Sept. 21 can extend the due date temporarily for the month.             In the case of electricity bills, a three-month suspension is applied to bills charged from October to December. Households that already applied for an extension in the first round in April can delay their payment due date without having to submit another application. Households that plan to apply this time are encouraged to use the Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) call center.             Small business owners with a contract for 20 kilowatts of power or less can apply immediately without meeting any qualifications. If the contracted power exceeds 20 kilowatts, business owners need documents to confirm that they are a small-sized business.             Shops with a sharp decline in their electricity usage as a result of social distancing can switch to a power purchase agreement plan and save money. The power purchase agreement plan sets a fixed cost for each month and charges extra for any usage above the threshold. The higher the trigger point, the higher the basic fee. If businesses with 10 kilowatts of contracted power reduce the base amount to 5 kilowatts, they can save about 30,000 won ($25) a month.           Individuals can be charged more if they adjusted the set amount within the last year. If the contracted power is lowered during the year and then raised again, the individual will have to return the discounted difference. Individuals who have never adjusted their contract power before can use the system once without having to return all the discounts.             The first to receive rent benefits are 800 businesses operating in government-owned industrial complexes. They will receive a 50 percent cut in rent for the September-to-December period.           Companies residing in leasing space from public institutions under the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy will receive up to 100 percent discounts in rent for the same period.             The ministry will speed up investment into public institutions. It plans to pay in advance for some 3.5 trillion won worth of projects originally planned for next year. It also plans to pay either in advance or faster than the agreed payment date for the 800 billion won worth of supplies it ordered to be used in government institutions.             Public institutions will make new hires for the fall recruitment season. A total of 5,139 new positions will be opened at government-owned companies like KPS, Kepco and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power in the latter half of the year.             The government will also triple the limit of performance guarantees for companies in the die-casting industry from the current 200 million won, and it will provide vouchers so that businesses can receive quality-improvement consulting.             Exhibition organizers will receive support. The government plans to cover the cost of these companies converting their events to online platforms. For textile companies, the government will support large-scale promotional campaigns for the Korea Sale Festa event. It will also push for special financing of some 300 billion won for machinery and aviation manufacturing companies.             BY KIM NAM-JUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

411,Bringing outdoor pursuits to the comfort of your own home,"

     A growing number of people, especially families with children, enjoy camping at home by setting up a tent in the middle of the living room. [NAM JEONG-MIN]               Just setting up a foldable camping table and camping chairs on your terrace can keep the coronavirus blues at bay. Some go even further and set up tents in the middle of their living rooms. Instead of turning on the television, a projector is set up and simple classic camping food is served.            Despite being indoors, a similar ambiance can be created, and in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic people feel safer indulging in the pleasures of camping at home rather than visiting camp sites.            Nam Jeong-min, 34, a mother of two children who are 10 and six, set up a tent in her living room. She took up outdoor pursuits about a year ago and has all the gear needed for camping, but hasn't been able to make much use of it in recent months due to the pandemic.             Instead, Nam has been gathering her family together inside the tent in her living room. They watch films using a projector and eat the same food that they would if they were actually camping. The children are especially fond of the newly changed living room.               “We use a camping burner to cook simple food we like such as tteokbokki [spicy rice cakes]. It’s nice to feel like we’re out in nature,” said Nam.              A room is decked with camping gear. [LEE HYEON-AH]               Lee Hyeon-ah, 33, transformed a small room in her home into a camping room.            Lee and her husband are avid campers so they dedicated the room to store their camping gear in June. As the coronavirus showed no sign of letting up, the couple began spending their spare time in their special camping room.            A small, white tent is set up on the floor that is covered with wood tiles. When the main light of the room is turned off and camping lights are on, the mood is complete.             “I see some of the reservations I made for camping sites have been canceled due to the coronavirus. In that case, we comfort ourselves with camping at home,” said Lee.             Cho Su-jeong, 31, who walked down the aisle in March, is a novice camper. But the beginner found it particularly difficult to purchase the gear she needed as most of it was sold out due to the unusually high popularity of camping this year with the outbreak of the coronavirus.           Cho simply wanted to try out some camping gear indoors before heading outside. She set up tables, chairs, parasols and lights. Cho said lanterns are a must-have item for those who want to enjoy camping at home. “What I did was simply put a lantern on the camping table and strangely enough it helped me relax and put my mind at ease.             “My husband and I used to watch TV or look at our smartphones, but since we began camping at home we now talk to each other a lot more than we did before,” she added.                With a few foldable chairs, a table and beam projector, the camping atmosphere is complete. [CHO SU-JEONG]               While camping has been gaining popularity with people in their 20s, 30s and 40s over the past few years, it has become tremendously popular in recent months as people are being encouraged to spend time in spacious outdoor spaces during the pandemic.            Market research firm Consumer Insight released a survey on Aug. 18 which showed the types of accommodation people prefer during the coronavirus pandemic. As of the second quarter of this year, a majority of survey respondents, 22.7 percent, said they chose to stay in the homes of their friends or families. Before the pandemic, hotels almost always topped the survey, while 4.8 percent said they preferred to camp.             In line with the growing popularity, sales of camping supplies also soared. Between April and May, market insiders said supplies failed to meet the demand.             E-commerce site Gmarket, operated by eBay Korea, said sales of camping chairs, camping tables, tents and tarps all increased between May 1 and Sept. 7, compared to the same period last year. For example, tarps saw a whopping 64 percent increase in sales while camping chairs increased by 48 percent.             But as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has been on the rise since August, the demand for camping has been decreasing. To make matters worse, the longest rainy season on record this summer and frequent typhoons stopped campers from going out. Ardent campers eventually turned to camping at home.             As of Sept. 8, 32,000 posts can be found on Instagram with the hashtag “home camping.”               People who enjoy camping at home say lights are the must-have item for home camping. [CHO SU-JEONG]       Simple camping food served with camping containers. [CHO SU-JEONG]               Realizing that a large number of people were seeking ways to refresh themselves at home, Emart Traders, the leading discount chain, decided to sell camping gear at discounted prices from May to August. Sales of artificial grass, inflatable pools, gas grills and barbecue equipment saw double-digit sales increases compared to the same period a year ago.           As the temperature is beginning to dip in the evenings and the morning air is becoming crisper and cleaner, camping, whether indoors or outdoors, is the perfect activity for all ages to enjoy.           For those who want to take a break but are concerned about maintaining social distance, camping at home is highly recommended.             In terms of equipment, a tent is a good item to start with and as mentioned, many home campers recommend indoor lights or lanterns to set the ambiance.            Lee, who has a camping room in her home, said, “It doesn’t have to be high-quality lights. Just buy string lights. And add a wood table and a Bluetooth speaker. They will add the special camping vibe to your ordinary space.”             BY YOO JI-YOEN   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]     "

413,Raid finds transcript of call about Choo's son's leave,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae attends a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  [YONHAP]                Prosecutors retrieved Tuesday a transcript of a phone call made to the Ministry of National Defense to request an extension of a medical leave for Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae's son in 2017, according to sources.             The prosecution raided the Ministry of National Defense and the Army on Tuesday as a part of its investigation into allegations that Choo's son, whose surname is Seo, received preferential treatment. Seo served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018. Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) at the time.             Several whistle-blowers have said Seo was let off the hook when he failed to return to base at the end of a sick leave in June 2017, which had already been extended once. Suspicions were raised that Choo or her husband had telephoned the ministry to seek a second extension, and Seo was subsequently allowed to use personal days. Choo's aide at the time was also suspected of having contacted the military to extend the leave.             According to the prosecution and military sources, prosecutors raided the Defense Computing Information Agency of the Ministry of National Defense Tuesday afternoon and searched the main server of the ministry to find records of the alleged phone requests.             The mandatory archiving period for phone communication transcripts is three years, and prosecutors earlier said relevant data had been deleted from the call center system of the ministry. Through the raid, the prosecutors confirmed that the transcripts were kept in the main server and seized the evidence, sources from the prosecution and military said.           According to the sources, the prosecution also found a phone number allegedly used to call the ministry to extend the sick leave. It is expected to allow the prosecutors to identify whether Choo or her husband telephoned the ministry to arrange the extension.             Following a revelation by Rep. Kim Do-eup of the opposition People Power Party (PPP), the ministry admitted last week that a record remained in the archive that Seo had an interview with a military officer in June 2017 regarding his medical leave. ""I consulted with my parents [about extending the sick leave], and I confirmed that my parents made a request,"" the record said.             The ministry said Seo's parent did call the ministry, but refused to say which. The ministry added that Seo's twice-extended medical leave did not violate any regulations.           During a National Assembly hearing on Monday, opposition lawmakers asked Choo if she had telephoned the ministry to seek a favor for her son. ""I did not,"" Choo said. Asked if her husband had done so, Choo said, ""We live separately and only meet on weekends, so I had no opportunity to ask him.""             During the hearing, PPP Rep. Park Hyeung-soo asked Choo if her aide had telephoned the military, based on a former military officer's statement that he had received the call and thought it was odd for a lawmaker's aide to take care of her son's business.             ""I want to make clear that I never ordered my aide to make the call,"" Choo said.             That response was slightly different from her earlier stance. On Sept. 1, Choo was asked during a National Assembly committee meeting if her aide had made the phone call. ""It never happened,"" Choo said.             Park repeated the question to Choo, asking if her aide phoned the military. Choo said, ""I don't know about that.""             ""Did you check with your aide about the phone call?"" Park continued.           ""I don't want to,"" Choo replied. ""I shouldn't intervene in an ongoing investigation.""              Meanwhile, the prosecutors conducted a separate raid of the Army Data System Management Group in South Chungcheong on Tuesday. Because the Katusa unit was managed by the personnel command of the Army, records were also kept about Seo's military service in the group's archive.             BY SER MYO-JA, KIM JI-HYE   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "

416,Korea scrambles to line up coronavirus vaccines,"

     Health care workers spray disinfectant Tuesday at a traditional market in Incheon. [YONHAP]          Health authorities vowed Tuesday to get vaccines for 60 percent of Korea’s population as a first step to building up national immunity against Covid-19.           The vaccine plan was discussed in a cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, officials at the Ministry of Health and Welfare said in a follow-up press briefing.             The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), which is the new name for the upgraded Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), is expected to devise a more specific blueprint by no later than October, officials said.             No proven vaccine has been developed yet. Exactly who will fall among the 60 percent, or 30 million people, to be vaccinated first was not revealed. Im In-taek, director of health industry policy at the Health Ministry, said authorities would discuss that issue with experts in the following weeks.           According to a draft of the plan announced by the Health Ministry on Tuesday, the government plans to secure 20 million doses for 10 million people through Covax Facility, a global Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan co-led by the GAVI vaccine alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO). The assumption is that two doses of the vaccine will be needed for each individual.           Simultaneously, the Korean government will try to get 40 million doses for 20 million people through global pharmaceutical companies who have successfully developed a vaccine.           All together, 60 million doses for 30 million people — about 60 percent of Korea’s total population — is supposed to be secured in the first step.           In the second step, the Korean government will gradually work towards sourcing more vaccines for the rest of the population while monitoring progress made in vaccine development among domestic labs. Domestic supplies could at some point become possible.                            As to why the Korean government was trying to immunize 60 percent of the population, Im explained it all came down to herd immunity — the point at which a disease has trouble spreading because a sufficient percentage of the population has become immune.           “We need 60 to 70 percent of the national population [to be immune] in order to build herd immunity, which means we need to meet that minimum threshold for the general public to feel at ease,” Im said.           The Health Ministry said the Korean government sent a formal document to GAVI on Aug. 31 expressing its intent on joining the Covax Facility, and that the government was planning to follow that up with another legally binding document finalizing its participation by no later than Friday.             The ministry said member countries are required to pay about $3.50 per dose in prepayment charges toward the global initiative, which is why the government has set aside 172.3 billion won and plans to complete the transaction by no later than Oct. 9.           The ministry also said it was considering financial support for developing countries trying to secure vaccines.           Korea’s joining of the global race to get its hands on vaccine supplies comes as the nation added 106 new cases of the coronavirus Monday, down from 109 the previous day.           Data released by the KDCA Tuesday morning showed 91 were local infections, including 32 in Seoul, 31 in Gyeonggi, eight in Incheon, four in Busan, three each in South Chungcheong and Jeju Island, two each in Daejeon, North Chungcheong and South Gyeongsang, and one each in Gwangju, Gangwon, North Jeolla and North Gyeongsang.             Out of 15 imported cases, six were from the United States, two each from Russia and Mexico, and one each from the Philippines, Indonesia, Kuwait, Poland and Turkey.           Four people died Monday, bringing total deaths to 367, while 389 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 18,878.           As of Monday at midnight, Korea had counted 22,391 coronavirus patients in all.           With the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures lifted for Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi — together called greater Seoul or the Seoul metropolitan area — the Education Ministry announced Tuesday that schools in the region will reopen next Monday for the first time in 26 days, albeit with restrictions.             Through Oct. 11, kindergartens, elementary and middle schools will be required to run up to a third of their full capacities, while high schools will run up to two-thirds.             Schools outside the Seoul metropolitan area will have to follow the same guidelines from Monday to Oct. 11.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
417,Eximbank issues $1.5 billion in bonds to foreign investors,"

                  The state-run Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) said Tuesday that it has issued $1.5 billion worth of bonds to foreign investors.           Eximbank has sold three-year bonds worth 500 million euros ($594 million), $400 million in five-year dollar bonds and $500 million in dollar bonds that will mature in 10 years.           The euro-denominated social bonds carry a yield of minus 0.118 percent, the lowest interest rate offered by Korean institutions, the state lender said.           A negative bond yield means that an investor earns less money than the original purchase price when the bond matures.           The five-year dollar bonds carry a yield of 0.758 percent, and the 10-year dollar debt yields 1.316 percent, the lowest return offered by local institutions since the 2008 global financial crisis.           The state trade bank said the bond sale drew bids 5.1 times the proposed amount, adding the proceeds will be used to support coronavirus-hit smaller companies and finance the Korean-version New Deal project aimed at spurring the economy.           Eximbank said it has succeeded in attracting strong interest from foreign investors by actively capitalizing on Korea's recent sale of euro-denominated foreign exchange stabilization bonds at a negative yield.           Last week, Seoul issued bonds worth $625 million and 700 million euros for its foreign exchange stabilization scheme. The 10-year dollar-denominated bonds carry a yield of 1.198 percent, while the five-year euro-denominated bonds carry a yield of minus 0.059 percent. It was the first time that a non-European nation sold euro-denominated bonds with a negative yield.           Yonhap   "

419,HDC may sue Kumho Industrial and Asiana Airlines,"

     HDC Holdings Chairman Chung Mong-gyu during a press event held in central Seoul in November after the company was selected as a preferred bidder to acquire Asiana Airlines in a consortium with Mirae Asset Daewoo. [YONHAP]               Hyundai Development Company (HDC) may take legal action in its failed acquisition of Asiana Airlines, according to a statement it released Tuesday.            The company agreed last December to buy the 30.77 percent of the carrier from Kumho Industrial as well as newly issued shares, but the transaction fell apart after HDC said it could not complete to takeover until it had conducted additional due diligence on the troubled airline.           In the statement, HDC blamed Kumho Industrial and Asiana for the collapse of the deal, noting their ""unilateral termination of the acquisition on Sept. 11."" It added that it may take action against the two companies after reviewing the relevant law.           HDC made specific mention in the statement of the 250 billion won ($212 million) down payment it made for the transaction, in which it would have acquired control of Asiana Airlines and six subsidiaries, including budget carriers Air Busan and Air Seoul, for 2.5 trillion won.             They company blamed Korea Development Bank (KDB), an Asiana Airlines creditor, for not working with it in good faith, saying that it met with the bank's chairman Aug. 26, but that nothing meaningful was discussed.           HDC said its repeated request for additional due diligence “wasn’t an excessive request at all” since HDC Group’s survival could have been threatened by numerous risks involving the airline. The company noted a Fair Trade Commission decision last month to fine Asiana Airlines and related companies a total of 32 billion won for wrongdoings related to the airline's catering contract.           It also took issues with the ballooning debt of the airline, specifically the issuing of the convertible debt without the consent of the acquirer.           Kumho Industrial said it handed over materials requested by HDC during the acquisition process, while the KDB chairman blamed HDC last month for the failure of the deal and said that accusations leveled by the buyer are groundless and malicious.             HDC said it planned to develop a diversified transportation company with the purchase of Asiana and that it finds the termination of the deal confusing.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleAsiana deal falls apart, creditors left to manage airlineHDC not budging on demands for Asiana acquisitionAsiana Airlines catering quid pro quo draws big FTC fines"
420,Instagram strengthens policies to prevent cyberbullying,"

     Instagram’s new ""restricted accounts“ service. [SCREEN CAPTURE]  Instagram has launched a battle against cyberbullying.     The social media platform announced strengthened policies and services to prevent cyberbullying among its users in an online press conference held Tuesday.     Under the new guidelines, all Instagram users who experience or witness cyberbullying on the platform can report the case. A review team will monitor reports at all hours and delete reported posts if necessary.     Instagram has also been working with Facebook to enhance and expand the artificial intelligence (AI) technology used in its cyberbullying monitoring system. Instagram's AI technology automatically flags inappropriate posts and reports to the company's review team.          “Cyberbullying exists in various forms including malicious comments, threats and intentional bullying,” said Philip Chua, head of Instagram Asia-Pacific's Public Policy team, during the conference. “We’ve been educating our AI technology so that it can monitor those cyberbullying cases.”     The platform also came up with a set of new guidelines to protect its users.     Users can now decide who can make comments on their posts. They can also control who can tag them in photos or videos.     Under the new “restricted accounts” option, users are able to protect themselves from unwanted interactions without having to block or unfollow people. In that case, restricted people won't know whether the users are online or whether the users read their messages or not.     Any posts or videos showing self-harming can also no longer be posted or viewed on Instagram.     The social media firm also said it plans to introduce a new service that automatically warns users about cyberbullying in advance when they are about to make a malicious comment. The service, which will be introduced by the end of September, is aimed at encouraging users not to make negative comments.     When Chua was asked about plans to shut down the comment section just like Naver and Daum have done on some news services, he emphasized that not allowing users to make any comments won’t solve the problem.     “Instagram is a space where people can communicate and share their thoughts freely,” Chua said. “We will try harder to protect users from cyberbullying by using the AI technology and the firm’s review monitoring system.”       BY CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]  "
421,"Amid a pandemic, the kitchen has become a safe space","

     Swedish furniture giant Ikea announces late last month that it would provide kitchen installation services in the Korean market. [IKEA]                Swedish furniture juggernaut Ikea announced late last month that it would provide a kitchen installation service by teaming up with local home décor application Today House.           Ikea sells various kitchen furniture and accessories such as knobs, taps and worktops, but for those who can't tell the difference between nails and screws, assembling is the hardest part.           Ikea’s kitchen installation service targets people who just want the end products.           Customers first need to browse kitchen furniture and goods through the smartphone application for Today House, and then they can get a consultation with Ikea staff members. Payment comes next and then your kitchen is built by technicians.           The local home décor company apart:mentary also launched three different types of kitchen installation products earlier this month, and it is getting rave reviews for those looking to refurbish their kitchens.           Hanssem, the country’s largest furniture company, opened a store called “Kitchen & Bath” on Aug. 15 in Gwanggyo, Gyeonggi. The store displays everything you might need for your kitchen or bathroom.           The home décor and furnishing industries have been thriving since the outbreak of the coronavirus.           Living in the so-called “untact” era, people are encouraged to stay at home and spaces, like the kitchen, are being rediscovered.           According to Hanssem, the company saw a whopping 50 percent increase in sales of kitchen furniture in August compared to the previous year.            This can be attributed to more and more consumers remodeling their kitchens as they spend their days at home.            Of all the kitchen furniture products Hanssem offers, the rock-bottom line is especially popular. The company saw a 100 percent sales increase of the inexpensive line every month during the first quarter of this year.           Park Dong-hee, a manager at the business development team of Today House, said, “These days, the kitchen is considered the space for entertainment.”           She continued, “Young people in their 20s and 30s including single households are highly interested in cooking and mukbangs [eating shows], and they have this desire to improve their kitchens.”           Today House lists various home décor ideas, but the company is especially focused on kitchens.           In July, the company launched a service called Today House Designer Kitchen, which enables its application users to browse products of small and private-owned home décor companies. Its services and products are cheaper than those provided by major home décor companies, and Today House provides warranties and guarantees the quality of the kitchen furniture.           Apart:mentary also cites the kitchen as the ""it"" space of the home after analyzing home trends for the year.             The living room or master bedroom were considered the highlight spaces in the past, but apart:mentary sees the kitchen as the most important space of today’s home.           This trend is evident from brand-new apartment buildings these days.           The kitchen and the living room are not divided, but connected. Sometimes, the U-shaped kitchen is adopted instead of L-shaped or single-walled kitchens, so that a person cooking can communicate with the rest of the family in the living room.             While the outbreak of the coronavirus can be seen as one reason for an increasing number of people who wish to remodel their kitchens, another reason is that remodeling a kitchen is cost-effective and can be done quickly. Unlike other remodeling projects, a kitchen remodel can be completed within half a day.               Wood finishes are popular nowadays. [APART:MENTARY]                Kitchen spaces are also becoming more unique and taking a step away from the cookie-cutter spaces of the past.           Park from Today House said, “Some people install shelves instead of having cupboards. Or they try some new materials they never used before such as wood or stainless steel instead of artificial marble for worktops.”           Kitchen furniture used to be either white or gray, but now more bold colors like green are used.           With an increase in the usage of small appliances like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines, specially designed pantries are preferred to store all these gadgets.           Materials that are close to nature are popular, too.           Yoon So-yeon, the head of apart:mentary, said, “Once there was a time when all the customers chose high-gloss [cabinets] over wood, but now they are returning to wood.”           BY YOO JI-YOEN   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]                             "
422,IAEA chief condemns North's continuing nuclear activities,"

     Satellite images published in a report by the North Korea analysis website 38 North show flooding along the Kuryong River bisecting the Yongbyon nuclear complex in late July and early August. [YONHAP]               The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday expressed deep regret with North Korea’s continued nuclear activities, labeling them a clear violation of United Nations resolutions.             In an introductory statement to the IAEA’s board of governors, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said the agency had indications Pyongyang was continuing to produce enriched uranium at a reported centrifuge facility at Yongbyon.           It was also likely the regime has continued construction at an experimental light-water reactor (LWR) in the area, Grossi continued, but he noted that the 5 MW(e) nuclear reactor and radiochemical laboratory at the complex appeared inoperative.             “The DPRK’s nuclear activities remain a cause for serious concern,” Grossi added, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.           “I call upon the DPRK to comply fully with its obligations under Security Council resolutions, to cooperate promptly with the Agency in the full and effective implementation of its NPT Safeguards Agreement and to resolve all outstanding issues, especially those that have arisen during the absence of Agency inspectors from the country.”           A director general report on North Korea published on Sept. 3 noted that a series of developments had been observed at the Yongbyon site, the biggest and most prominent of the regime’s nuclear facilities.           Observed emissions at Yongbyon’s nuclear fuel rod fabrication plant showed chemical processing for the production of enriched uranium had occurred, the report said. As for the experimental light-water reactor, deliveries of materials and reactor components were observed, as well as what appeared to be a test for cooling water infrastructure in April of this year.             The experimental light-water reactor at Yongbyon, which Pyongyang initially insisted was for electricity production, has been in the works for almost a decade. International security experts have noted the reactor could be used to produce plutonium for the regime’s weapons program, or develop techniques for larger reactors in the future.           Though it is currently facing one of the most grave challenges to its regime since the mid-1990s amid the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has continued to pour resources and attention into its weapons program.           Earlier this month, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) noted the regime could be gearing up for a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) test, based on satellite images of ships moored at Sinpo harbor.           The vessels resembled those used to tow a test stand barge out to sea, the think tank said, suggesting the regime may test an SLBM to mark the 75th anniversary of its ruling Workers’ Party on Oct. 10.             South Korea’s Minister of National Defense nominee, Gen. Suh Wook, dismissed a potential SLBM launch by Pyongyang in October as unlikely, noting that there were no signs of such preparations.           But he acknowledged the regime is continuing to strengthen the capabilities of its submarines able to carry those types of missiles.           The North is believed to be building a 3,000-ton submarine that South Korean intelligence believes can carry up to three SLBMs.             If the country’s scientists have successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead for the missile, these weapons could give Pyongyang the ability to target the continental United States from waters several thousand kilometers off of California.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

424,Hyundai throws out the playbook with new Tucson,"

     Hyundai Motor's fourth generation Tucson compact SUV. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               Hyundai Motor has fully revamped its compact SUV Tucson for the first time in five years, making substantial changes not just to the exterior and interior of the vehicle, but also under the hood.           The Seoul-based automaker broadcast the launch of the fourth generation Tucson through a number of online channels, including its official website and YouTube, on Sept. 15. More than 10,000 viewers around the world logged on to see the world premiere of the new car.           The most obvious change is to the front of the vehicle, which doesn't really look anything like its predecessors. In fact it doesn't really look much like most cars, thanks to the very obvious lack of daylight headlamps.           Rather than having a headlamp to either side of the grille, as is traditional, Hyundai has installed what it calls Parametric Hidden Lamps, or lights incorporated into the grille that are invisible when not on.           The vehicle has got 150 millimeters (5.9 inches) longer to 4,630 millimeters, falling only 155 millimeters short of Hyundai's Santa Fe. The automaker says the leg room in the second row has been extended by 80 millimeters to 1,050 millimeters.              The interior of Hyundai Motor's Tucson compact SUV. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               The interior has had a similarly dramatic makeover.           The headlamps weren't the only staple that Hyundai has done away with — gone, too, are the air conditioning vents normally found arrayed along the front of the dashboard. Instead, one long, discreet air vent wraps around the entire vehicle, offering indirect ventilation to everybody in the car.           Hyundai Motor said it was inspired by the systems used in airplanes, where the air quality and temperature are always set to the right level, but without a blast of air being directed in anybody's face.           In addition to its physical transformation, the all-new Tucson comes equipped with air conditioning technology that is able to proactively clean the air through sensors, maintain a preset temperature by controlling ventilation and functions even when the engine is off to get rid of smells, all of which are firsts for Hyundai.            In terms of powertrain, the latest Tucson is the first to add eco-friendly engines — hybrid and plug-in hybrid — to the existing diesel- and gasoline-powered versions. Together they offer a total of 12 engine options, although which types will come to which markets is not decided yet.           The plug-in hybrid version will not launch in Korea, but is for overseas market only.            Diesel and gasoline versions started receiving preorders in Korea from Sept. 16. The price for the gasoline model is set between 24.3 million won ($20,600) and 31.5 million won and diesel between 26.2 million won and 33.4 million won. The hybrid version's price will be revealed next month, the carmaker said.           ""The Tucson proudly stands in our lineup as the most dynamic SUV design and conveys a trendsetting spirit,"" said Lee Sang-yup, head of the Hyundai Global Design Center during the online event.           ""We didn't want to create just another SUV, we wanted to create something iconic.""           The Tucson SUV is one of Hyundai's bestselling models.            Last year, it sold 541,916 units globally, becoming the most sold SUV model for the automaker.

425,PREVIEW: Jamie Lloyd's 'Cyrano de Bergerac' will leave you lost for words ,"

     James McAvoy playing Cyrano in Jamie Lloyd's ""Cyrano de Bergerac."" [MARK BRENNER]               Cyrano is a man with low self-esteem due to his oddly large and funny-looking nose. He becomes daring and even aggressive toward those who mock him. But with Roxane, a charming woman whom he loves, he becomes timid, believing that she will never love him back.           Cyrano is the protagonist in Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play “Cyrano de Bergerac.”             Perhaps due to the globally appealing storyline that many people can resonate with, the play has been adapted in various genres including musicals, opera, film and has even turned into a book.             The latest version of the play, directed by Jamie Lloyd, which will be screened at the National Theater of Korea’s NT Live — a broadcasting project of world-class theater — in October, won't just win the audience's sympathy, it will also fascinate them with words.            Using Martin Crimp’s adaptation of the screenplay, Lloyd turns the stage into a rap battleground at one point, and then into a powerfully emotive poetry recital session at another, both of which will amaze with the power of words.             Casting heartthrob James McAvoy to play the role in this modern play that depicts the 17th-century Paris, was a magic move.             The stage is empty. There are no props, other than a couple of microphones that the actors use and some chairs. There’s no backdrop and no costumes. Not even the bizarre-looking nose that usually gets stuck on the actor’s face who plays Cyrano makes an appearance. Only through glorious language and McAvoy’s acclaimed acting does Lloyd create one great performance.             The play, which premiered at the Playhouse Theatre in London late last year, received high praise from theater critics from renowned papers like The New York Times and The Guardian.             What Lloyd uses to grab the audience’s attention to his latest play is simplicity. He doesn’t use stage design, props or costumes that would help audience members to easily comprehend the atmosphere of 17th-century Paris.            The completed play in fact, will rather remind you of a rehearsal stage. Actors appear wearing modern clothing, as if they've just turned up to work and didn't have time to change. They speak their parts using standing microphones. The setting of Lloyd’s “Cyrano de Bergerac” still takes place in 1640 France, using the original storyline, but thanks to Crimp’s postmodern retooling of the screenplay and Lloyd’s brave modernization of the staging, ""Cyrano de Bergerac” is no longer the classic play that many people have grown out of.             The modern, minimal stage that appears as if it can do nothing to immerse the audience into the play taking place centuries ago, instead stimulates the imagination.             Instead of using prop swords in a battle scene, the actors plunge the standing microphones into each other. They touch McAvoy’s average-sized nose as if it’s so huge and weird.              In Act 2, a man appears on the stage with a paint brush and writes something on the blank, white backdrop. It takes a while for one to comprehend what it says — what Lloyd has intended I believe.             Then as the man leaves the stage, the statement becomes legible: “I love words. That’s all.”             This bare confession is so strong, it makes you admit the genius of the director and understand why he emptied out the stage.            I personally believe the play was especially immersive because it is a recorded version. Usually, performances seen through NT Live seem to reduce the emotions you get from a real live theater. But through the many close-ups of McAvoy who gazes directly at the camera despite speaking to Roxane, you become helplessly deluded as if he’s confessing his love to you. Men are no exception as you’ll see in the play.              Poster of the National Theater of Korea's NT Live of ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" which will begin its broadcasting on Oct. 8.                Thanks to the close-ups, you can also vividly see the tender glance Cyrano gives Roxane when he reads out the love letters that he wrote on behalf of Christian — the handsome man whom Roxane falls in love with. You can also witness his eyes tearing up as he watches Roxane kissing Christian after being moved by the sincere confession of love written by Cyrano himself.             It’s not just McAvoy who presents great acting. All the cast raps, or speaks the lines, as if they are real musicians. The delivery of all their lines are so clear that you become lost for words, by the words. Especially for a person who writes for a living, you just want to get your hands on that screenplay so you can dwell on every incredibly written sentence.             The play will be screened at the Daloreum Theater of the National Theater of Korea in central Seoul from Oct. 8 to 11 and on Oct. 15, starting from 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, and at 3 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. To follow the government’s social distancing regulation, there will be an empty seat between each audience member. The play is in English with Korean subtitles. Tickets cost 20,000 won ($17).

426,Korean exporters warned to monitor Indian trade restrictions,"

                  Korean companies need to keep close tabs on India's anti-dumping rules and other trade remedies to protect its domestic industries, a report said Tuesday.           India, Asia's third largest economy, has been beefing up efforts to shield its domestic industries from foreign competitors by sharply raising import regulation probes in recent years.           ""India's import regulations have recently been very tough and aggressive,"" the report from the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) said. ""Korean exporters should pay closer attention to them.""           In February, New Delhi amended its enforcement decrees on anti-dumping and countervailing duties, and subsidies in a show of its growing protectionist tendencies.           ""In particular, Korean steel and petrochemical manufacturers should pre-emptively brace for the potential risk of import controls as they are prone to India's anti-dumping and countervailing tariffs,"" the report said.           According to the report, India's new investigations for import restrictions came to an average 60.5 cases per year between 2016 and 2019, nearly double the 30.3 cases recorded from 2010-15.           China was the No. 1 target of India's probes with 77 cases since 2016, followed by Korea with 24, Thailand with 22 and Malaysia with 21.           Korean companies have been ramping up efforts to make forays into the world's second-most populous country, which has been emerging as one of the most promising markets in the world.           In the first half of this year, Korea's exports to India sank 33.2 percent on year to $5.36 billion amid the coronavirus pandemic, with imports from India falling only 5.3 percent to $2.59 billion. Seoul is seeking to hike bilateral trade with India to $50 billion a year by 2030. Last year, bilateral trade reached $20.7 billion.           Yonhap   "
427,Finance sector sees healthy rise in assets in first half,"

     Financial Supervisory Service building in Yeouido, western Seoul. [YONHAP]               Assets of financial holding companies increased 7.4 percent in the first half compared to six months earlier as demand for loans rose, Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) data showed Tuesday.             Total assets of the 10 financial holding companies increased 194 trillion won ($164 billion) to reach 2,823 trillion won. The 10 companies are KB, Shinhan, Nonghyup, Woori, Hana, BNK, DGB, JB, Korea Investment and Meritz Holdings.           By categories, assets owned by investment firms grew the fastest — increasing 18.9 percent or 48.3 trillion won. This was due to an increase in the value of equities they hold and increases in deposits by retail investors for stock trading.           Assets of commercial banks increased by 6.5 percent or 128.6 trillion won from a surge in loans.            At credit card companies, assets grew by 7.1 percent or 10.3 trillion won from January to June. For insurance companies, assets increased by 3.7 percent or 8.2 trillion won over the same period.            Net profits of the 10 holding companies dropped 11 percent or 943 billion won to reach 7.63 trillion won in June. Investment firms saw the largest drop of 29.1 percent or 518.8 billion won, as fund investments and trading suffered losses in the first half.             Net profits at commercial banks dropped 14 percent or 895.1 billion won as banks accumulated more reserves to prepare for coronavirus uncertainties and possible bad loans.            Insurance companies and credit card companies, on the other hand, saw net profits increase by the double digits. The net profit at insurance companies increased 158.2 billion won or 26.9 percent. At credit card companies, net profits rose by 254.2 billion won or 25 percent over the six-month period.             Asset quality also improved. The substandard-or-below loans ratio dropped by 0.03 percentage points compared to the end of last year and reached 0.55 percent in June. This means that the ratio of loans expected to result in a loss of interest for the lender has decreased over the past six months.            The coverage ratio, which indicates a company’s ability to handle its outstanding debt, increased by 5.33 percentage points to 128.62 percent.             The FSS said it will supervise financial holding companies to prepare for economic uncertainties that can rise from the pandemic.             “We will guide them to strengthen their ability to absorb losses by saving more reserves, expand their capital and liquidity and prepare for another surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Kim Taek-ju, a spokesperson for the FSS.             BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]                "
428,ICT exports up 0.3 percent on year in August,"

                  Korea's outbound shipments of ICT products edged up 0.3 percent on year in August, data showed Tuesday, as exports of memory chips, computers and peripherals remained robust amid the coronavirus pandemic.           Exports of ICT products reached $15.24 billion last month, according to the data compiled by the Ministry of Science and ICT. This marks the third month in a row that monthly exports have moved up compared with 2019.           Imports moved up 4.3 percent to $9.19 billion in August, resulting in a trade surplus of $6.05 billion in ICT trade, data showed.           ICT products, a key contributor to Korean exports, have been hit by Covid-19. They plunged 15.3 percent on-year in April and contracted 2.6 percent in the following month before making a rebound in June with 1 percent growth, followed by an increase of 3.3 percent in July.           By segment, exports of semiconductors, a critical item for Asia's fourth-largest economy, gained 2.6 percent from the previous year to reach $8.29 billion.           Outbound shipments of computers and related products nearly doubled over the period to reach $1.34 billion, as more people worked from home due to the virus outbreak.           Overseas sales of mobile devices, such as smartphones, on the other hand, plunged 33 percent to $700 million, with exports of displays falling 17 percent to $1.8 billion over the cited period.           Exports to China, the largest overseas market for locally made ICT products, backtracked 3.3 percent to $7.1 billion, with shipments to Vietnam down 2 percent to $2.76 billion.           Shipments to the United States, however, shot up 18 percent to $1.75 billion over the period.           Korea's overall exports have been losing ground since early this year, as the Covid-19 pandemic has hurt both consumption and production. In August, the country's exports stood at $39.66 billion, down 9.9 percent from a year earlier and marking the sixth consecutive month that outbound shipments have lost ground.           Yonhap   "
429,"SK Telecom, Kogas to detect gas leaks with quantum technology","

     Representatives from SK Telecom, Korea Gas Corp., Quantum Sensing and Korea Plant Maintenance pose with their agreement on Tuesday. [SK TELECOM]               SK Telecom has developed a quantum sensing technique to detect gas leaks in a move that widens the application of quantum-based technology.           In an agreement signed Tuesday, the telecommunications company will partner with Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas), Quantum Sensing and Korea Plant Maintenance to supply the state-run gas company with a quantum sensing-based gas safety system.           Quantum sensing refers to a technology that uses the analysis of atoms and photons, the tiniest particle of light possible, to ensure measurements with the highest possible sensitivity.           Quantum Gas Imaging is designed to “detect gas leaks and measure gas concentration by illuminating the target with lasers and analyzing reflected wavelengths, notifying the control center of possible risks in real time,” according to the company.           Compared to the widely-used infrared system, it promises to detect leaks from significantly further away — from a range of 150 meters (492 feet) — and identify leaks with a lower concentration of gas.           SK Telecom and Kogas plan to test-operate the advanced detection system this year at a large-sized gas facility.           The system is the latest in a series of attempts by SK Telecom to use quantum-based technology.             It developed a quantum random number generator (QRNG) chip to be used in security systems and then released a smartphone fitted with the chip in May in cooperation with Samsung Electronics.             The company plans to continue to expand its range of quantum projects.           “With Quantum gas imaging, we move one step closer to a safer society realized through technology,” said Park Jin-hyo, head of the security business at SK Telecom. “We will continue to develop diverse innovative services that can enhance people’s safety using quantum sensing technology.”            BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
430,Korean firms see sales decline a record amount in Q2,"

                  Korean companies' sales declined at the sharpest clip on record in the second quarter as their business activity was hit by the new coronavirus outbreak, central bank data showed Tuesday.           Sales of local businesses dropped 10.1 percent in the April-June period from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.9 percent on-year fall in the first quarter, according to the data by the Bank of Korea (BOK).           The reading marked the sharpest on-year fall since the first quarter of 2015 when the BOK began compiling related data.           It also marked the sixth consecutive quarter of on-year decline in corporate sales.           The quarterly report is based on a review of 1,851 listed companies that are subject to external audits.           ""Local firms' sales and profitability worsened last quarter as manufacturers suffered business setbacks amid low oil prices and tepid demand for autos,"" a BOK official said.           Manufacturers saw their sales shrink 12.7 percent on year in the second quarter, faster than a 1.9 percent on-year fall in the first quarter and the sharpest on-year decline on record.           The Korean economy contracted 3.2 percent in the second quarter from three months earlier as exports and private consumption faltered on the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic.           Overseas shipments, which account for 50 percent of Asia's fourth largest economy, shrank a whopping 16.1 percent on quarter in the quarter ending June 30.           With a drop in sales, the gauges of corporate profitability worsened as well.           The average ratio of operating profit to sales came to 5.3 percent last quarter, lower than 5.5 percent in the same period of last year, the BOK said.           Local firms' total assets grew at an average 1.1 percent in the second quarter on the back of large firms' debt sales. The tally compared with a 0.2 percent on-year increase the previous year.           The average debt-to-equity ratio, a gauge of financial health, reached 87 percent as of end-June, down from 88.2 percent three months ago as companies paid out dividends in April.           Yonhap   "
431,Internet cafes say they are doomed if they can't serve food,"

                           Most of the seats remain empty at an internet cafe, in Seongdong District in eastern Seoul on Monday. While the government has allowed for the opening of internet cafes, restrictions remain.   Yoon Jae-jung, 54, who runs an internet cafe in Eunpyeong District, northern Seoul, is not entirely happy with the government’s lifting of the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing guidelines for the greater Seoul area.         With the eased measures, internet cafes are allowed to reopen starting on Monday. But the government has issued a few new rules: Minors are not allowed in the cafes, eating is prohibited and customers must not be seated too close to each other.       “Why is eating at internet cafes risky when eating at restaurants is considered to be safe? At internet cafes, customers eat while watching their monitors, not talking to others."" Yoon said. ""I don’t understand what makes the government think eating food at an internet cafe is dangerous.""     “I’m pleased that the government finally allowed us to reopen the business. But if the government doesn’t allow us to sell food in [internet] cafes, it’s no different than ordering us to close down.”     The average price for an hour at an internet cafe is 1,000 won ($0.85), though they cost a little more in urban areas and a little less in the countryside. According to internet cafe owners, of the 1,000 won, 15 percent, or 150 won, goes to game companies as royalties. In other words, if a visitor to an internet cafe doesn’t eat anything and only plays a game for an hour, the owner can earn just 850 won.     As a result, 4,000 won or 5,000 won of ramyeon or fried rice, as well as some cookies and chips that the owners sell in the cafe are their major source of income.     A woman in her 50s who runs an internet cafe in Seongdong District, eastern Seoul, says she is frustrated about the government’s “unreasonable” restrictions.       “Restaurants and cafes are the places where people talk to each other while eating and drinking. Allowing them but restricting us? This doesn't make any sense,” the woman said. “If I reopen the cafe, I need to pay so many fees, such as the electric bill, gas bill and water bill. I'd rather close it until the government lifts the regulations.”     She says many internet cafe owners in Seongdong District have already gone out of business. She might be forced to do the same.            Internet cafe owners hold a press conference in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Monday. [YONHAP]  The Korea Internet PC Culture Association, the Cooperative of Internet Contents Provider in Korea and the internet cafe owners across the country on Monday held a press conference in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, urging the government to lift restrictions on eating in internet cafes.       They said they welcome the government’s decision of excluding internet cafes from the list of high-risk business. But they argue restricting the sale of food is the same as ""telling them to close down their business.”     During the press conference, they criticized the government’s fourth supplementary budget, which focuses on supporting small businesses. The government last week announced a 7.8-trillion-won supplementary budget, with 2-million-won grants going to 2.91 million small businesses.     “We don’t understand how the government came up with the amount of 2 million won of cash grants,” Kim Byung-soo, chairman of the Korea Internet PC Culture Association, said. “Internet cafe owners, who have been faithfully following the guidelines more than anyone else, now feel devastated and have been driven into the corner.”     BY CHOI SUN-WOOK, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]  "
432,ADB 2020 forecast for the Korean economy unchanged,"

     Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki holding a video conference with Asian Development Bank President Masatsugu Asakawa on Monday in Seoul. [YONHAP]               The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecast the Korean economy to contract 1.0 percent in 2020, and that's good news considering that the estimate is unchanged from June.           Korea is one of the few Asian economies for which the outlook from the ADB is the same in its Asia Development Outlook 2020 Update, which was released Tuesday, as it was in the earlier report.             Domestic think tanks and institutions are more negative than the Manila-based multilateral.           State-financed Korea Development Institute (KDI) is looking for a 1.1 percent decline, down from an earlier projection of minus 0.2 percent. The Bank of Korea earlier changed its outlook from a 0.2 percent drop to 1.3 percent decline.           ADB noted the fall in trade due to the pandemic.             ""World trade declined sharply in the first half of 2020 in tandem with the collapse in global economic activity and the introduction of extension restrictions on travel and transport,” it noted. “Global trade was down by close to 20 percent year-on-year in April and May. The collapse was even bigger for trade in the major advanced economies as their aggregate exports fell by 27 percent year-on-year in April.”             While the ADB kept this year’s outlook for Korea unchanged, it did lower its forecast on next year.             The bank expects 3.3 percent growth for Korea in 2021. That’s a 0.2 percentage-point drop from June’s projection of 3.5 percent.           Korean lawmakers are currently reviewing the fourth supplementary budget, and the ADB noted that it would provide stimulus.           Noting the third supplementary budget at $29 million approved in July, a month after its last forecast, the ADB said the stimulus totaling $230 million would contribute boosting the domestic market.             ADB said uncertainty from Covid-19 remains the biggest risk factor for the Korean economy.             It report noted that ""a prolonged pandemic — either an extended first wave in some economies or recurrent waves in others — is the main risk to the outlook, as it would require protracted caution and containment measures, with consequent disruption to both supply and demand.”             It said the ""protracted weakness"" could trigger debt or a financial vulnerability crisis, while tension between the two major economic powers — the United States and China — is another factor that could negative impact growth.             U.S. sanctions against the Chinese tech company Huawei have been in place since Tuesday.             The ADB projected the economies of 45 Asian member states would contract 0.7 percent this year, a drop from negative 0.1 percent growth projected in June.             China's growth projection is unchanged at 1.8 percent, while Taiwan’s was also unchanged at a 0.8 percent increase.             For next year, the Asian economies are expected to grow 6.8 percent, faster than ADB's last projection of 6.2 percent.             On Monday Korean Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki held a video conference with ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa about Covid-19 cooperation as well as the possibility of opening an ADB office in Korea.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

The commission operates under the purview of the Supreme Court.           Under the proposed rules, courts can sentence those convicted of producing sexually explicit material depicting minors more than two times to a maximum prison sentence of 29 years and three months.             That's more than double the length of the 13-year maximum sentence courts are currently permitted to dole out for such crimes.             Those who profit off the sale of such content more than twice would warrant a maximum prison sentence of 27 years, while those convicted of distribution or soliciting minors to participate in the creation of such material may receive up to 18 years in prison.             The guidelines further specified sentencing factors that could increase or decrease the length of a prison sentence depending on the seriousness of the crime, recurrence and the behavior of the convict.             The maximum sentences outlined are to be reserved for the most harmful crimes, including cases in which a victim takes his or her life or is forced to end schooling.             By contrast, the commission also opened up the possibility of reduced sentencing for convicts who worked to mitigate the effects of their crimes, like deleting sexual material before it is distributed.             Sentences were also toughened for digital sex crimes not necessarily involving minors.             Those convicted of filming or distributing sexually explicit material through hidden cameras were liable to be sentenced to up to six years and nine months in prison, while criminals who created or spread digitally manipulated sexual content through so-called “deepfake” technology may also receive up to five years and seven months prison time.             If such material is made or distributed for profit, sentencing can be increased to up to nine years under the guidelines.             The Sentencing Commission is set to receive advice on the new guidelines from judges and experts until October, before they will be ratified during a final meeting of the commission in December.           The new guidelines follow a series of official measures implemented by legislators and law enforcement in Korea to address widespread public concerns that those convicted of digital sex crimes are punished lightly.           The extent of the country's illegal pornography trade captured national interest after police busted an immense online sex trafficking ring that used the messenger app Telegram, known as “Nth rooms.”           Suspects in the case — many allegedly led by 24-year-old Cho Ju-bin — are believed to have run a cartel that blackmailed what could be over a hundred victims into providing sexually explicit and degrading photographs and videos of themselves. The materials were then sold to members on chat rooms through the Telegram messaging app in exchange for cryptocurrency.           Many of the victims were discovered to be minors specifically targeted by the suspects due to their vulnerability to extortion, prosecutors said.            The state prosecution service in April said it was strengthening sentencing recommendations for suspects involved in these digital sex crimes, while the National Assembly passed a bill in May aimed at clamping down on such illicit content.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

With a little more attention, we can coexist harmoniously.”             The videos and photographs can be viewed via the musical’s official Instagram account (@musicofthenightkr) and KARA’s (@animal_kara).             A special anniversary poster featuring the ""Jellicle cats"" has also been created and is being sold through cat accessory shops Popart in Mapo District and Allergy in Yongsan District for 12,000 won ($10).

444,LG Electronics finally unveils its swiveling Wing,"

     LG Electronics' LG Wing smartphone. [LG ELECTRONICS]         After months of speculation, LG Electronics' rotating Wing smartphone will arrive in Korea next month, the company announced Monday.           And it doesn't rotate after all. It swivels.           LG Electronics finally shared the detail of its latest handset in an online event Monday, confirming, among other things, that it is called Wing.            The official price tag was not revealed, with a spokesman saying it has not yet been decided. Local media has reported that the phone is expected to be priced a little over a million won ($845), significantly cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold2, at 2.4 million won.           This is the electronics maker’s first handset that combines two screens into one device. LG’s previous dual screen phones, the V50 ThinQ 5G and V60 ThinQ 5G, came with separate, attachable secondary screens.           As hinted in LG’s video teasers, the 6.8-inch OLED top display can be rotated 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, exposing a smaller, square-sized screen underneath that, when deployed, makes the entire thing look like a ""T.""             In Swivel Mode — which is how LG describes the phone when the hidden screen has been rotated out — the two screens can be used for a single app or two apps. This means users can browse the internet and message friends while watching YouTube videos, but also use the smaller second screen as a remote control to fast forward or pause.             The T-shaped device can be used in various orientations, as seen in a leaked video which showed the top screen being used for a navigation app and the smaller screen to receive a phone call.           The top screen has a notch-less design with no camera to be seen. Instead, the 32-megapixel selfie camera is hidden behind the main screen and can pop out when needed.           On the back, the LG Wing has three cameras ranging from 12 to 64 megapixels. A feature LG introduces on the rotating smartphone is what it calls the “Gimbal” motion camera, taking its name from the pivoted device used for filming. This allows the user to hold the T-shaped smartphone with one hand while maintaining a stable video feed, LG said.             The device weighs 260 grams, which is 20 grams lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold2. The company used an aluminum alloy as the main material, along with the same technology found in its famously lightweight laptop, LG gram. It is 10.9 millimeters (0.4 inches) thick, around two millimeters slimmer than the Fold2.             The Wing is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G 5G — the U.S. chipmaker’s first application processor to integrate a 5G modem chip. The smartphone contains 8 gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of internal memory. An external memory card can be inserted to extend this by maximum 2 terabytes. It has a 4,000 milliampere-hour battery.           There are two color options: illusion sky and aurora gray.             In the past year, LG Electronics has been shaking up its smartphone business, which has been in the red for years. Last year, it relocated production facilities for mobile devices overseas in a cost-cutting effort. It also unveiled its first two dual-screen phones in 2019.             The new Wing is the first mobile release since the company announced earlier this month that it was working on a two-track strategy for its premium smartphones. ""Explorer"" devices — innovative and unconventional, like the Wing — and more traditional ""Universal"" phones.           “The Explorer Project is a challenge that will lead a new generation,” said Lee Yeon-mo, who heads LG Electronics’ mobile communications division. “As LG Wing marks the start of this project, we will grow with the market by offering experiences to customers that are looking for new adventures.”           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
445,"Interest rates, virus crisis lead to fevered borrowing","

             Koreans are borrowing money more than ever.           Ultra-low interest rates and government curbs on the real estate market are pushing a lot of people into stock investments — with borrowed money. On the more desperate pole, some people are borrowing to survive the prolonged Covid-19 crisis.           As of Sept. 10, the total amount of outstanding unsecured loans held by Korea's five commercial banks — KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori and NH Nonghyup — stood at 125.4 trillion won ($106 billion) — 1.1 trillion won more than at the end of last month, a 0.8 percent jump in just eight working days.           Interest rates on unsecured loans from commercial banks are between 1.85 and 3.75 percent.           If such a trend continues, the amount of new unsecured loans issued by commercial banks in September will exceed that of last month, when the figure hit an all-time monthly high of 4.07 trillion won.           Kakao Bank, one of Korea's two purely online banks, said the amount of unsecured loans on its books increased by 600 billion won in July and August, bringing the total amount of outstanding unsecured loans to 14.7 trillion won by the end of August.           Data showed that many people were borrowing from credit card companies.           Cash advances and credit card loans totaled 53 trillion won in the first half of 2020, a 1.4 percent jump year-on-year, the Financial Supervisory Service report showed Monday. Credit card loans in particular increased by 10.5 percent year-on-year.           This contrasts somewhat with a fall in credit and debit card transactions in the first half of the year. Payments on plastic totaled 424.7 trillion won in the first half, 0.3 percent less than the same period a year earlier.           The Covid-19 crisis is forcing some people to borrow money in such difficult times.           Others see debt as a way to make a profit. As the government cracked down on real estate speculation, people are looking for alternatives to invest their money, and new initial public offerings (IPOs) by SK Biopharmaceuticals and Kakao Games fanned their interest.           Unsecured loans from the five commercial banks increased by 1.8 trillion won on Sept. 1 alone — the day subscriptions for Kakao Games' IPO started.           More than 58 trillion won was put on deposit by investors hoping to get in on that IPO, a record for a Korean IPO.           As the amount of debt rises to dangerously high levels, financial authorities said they will look into whether there were inappropriate approvals of loans.           “I will look into whether the unprecedented spike in unsecured loans derived from overheated competition between banks to issue more loans,"" said Sohn Byung-doo, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, on Sept. 8.           Regulators are expected to soon crack down on unsecured loan approvals. As this type of loan doesn’t have collateral, the lender takes big risks in making them.           The regulators will also look into whether unsecured loans flowed into the property market.          BY AHN HYO-SUNG, JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

                  Microsoft said Sunday its offer to buy TikTok was rejected, leaving Oracle as the sole remaining bidder ahead of the imminent deadline for the Chinese-owned video app to sell or shut its U.S. operations.           TikTok is at the center of a diplomatic storm between Washington and Beijing, and U.S. President Donald Trump has set Americans a mid-September deadline to stop doing business with its Chinese parent company ByteDance — effectively compelling a sale of the app to a U.S. company.           The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported that Oracle had won the bidding war, citing people familiar with the deal, although the company did not immediately confirm that to AFP.           But two Chinese state media outlets — CGTN and China News Service — said Monday that ByteDance will not sell TikTok to Oracle either, citing unnamed sources.           The Oracle bid would need approval from the White House and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a source told the Journal, with both parties under the belief it would meet U.S. data security concerns.           Microsoft had indicated at the beginning of August that it was interested in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations, but announced Sunday that bid had been rejected.           ""ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's U.S. operations to Microsoft,"" it said in a statement.           ""We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests.""           In early August, Trump issued an executive order stating that if a purchase agreement was not reached by Sept. 20, the platform would have to close in the United States.           Trump claims TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.           In late August, China's commerce ministry published new rules potentially making it more difficult for ByteDance to sell TikTok to a U.S. entity by adding ""civilian use"" to a list of technologies that are restricted for export.           ByteDance had vowed to ""strictly abide"" by the new export rules.           ""We believe Microsoft would only buy TikTok with its core algorithm which the Chinese government and ByteDance was not willing to budge,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.           ""Given the need now to get a green light from Beijing after its export rules were changed a few weeks ago, TikTok's days in the U.S. likely are numbered with a shutdown now the next step,"" the analyst said.           Downloaded 175 million times in the United States, TikTok is used by as many as a billion people worldwide to make quirky, short videos on their cellphones. It has repeatedly denied sharing data with Beijing.           Microsoft said it would have ""made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety and combating disinformation.""           A deal with Microsoft could also have included Walmart, which joined forces with the tech company during negotiations.           Ives said that even with Microsoft out of the picture, ""while Oracle is technically the remaining bidder, without willing to sell its core algorithm we see no TikTok sale on the horizon.""           ""Oracle could be a technology partner, but a sale/divestiture of the U.S. operations for TikTok remains the focus.""           TikTok meanwhile has filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. crackdown, contending that Trump's order was a misuse of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the platform is not ""an unusual and extraordinary threat.""           Trump has demanded that the U.S. government get a cut of any deal, which critics contend appears unconstitutional and akin to extortion.           The bidding for TikTok comes during a broader deterioration of relations between the world's top two economies in recent months, with both exchanging fierce recriminations over trade, human rights and the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.           AFP   "

451,Seoul city official charged with rape,"

     Prosecutors Monday said they indicted a Seoul government official on charges of raping his colleague, the same victim who rocked the nation in July with claims she was sexually harassed by the late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. [YONHAP]          Prosecutors have indicted a Seoul government official on charges of raping a coworker in April, the same victim who claimed three months later she was sexually harassed by the late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon.           The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said the suspect was indicted last Thursday without physical detention on allegations of “quasi-rape” and inflicting physical harm during the process.           Korea’s criminal code defines quasi-rape as the act of having sexual intercourse with another person by taking advantage of his or her condition of unconsciousness or inability to resist. In this case, the victim claims she was inebriated. A conviction carries a minimum sentence of three years in prison.           Seoul prosecutors said Monday they were revealing the fact that the suspect was indicted last week after being inundated with phone calls from reporters asking about a bombshell interview with the victim’s lawyer published by a local magazine on Friday.             Kim Jae-ryon, the lawyer, told The Hankyoreh21 that her client, who previously came forward with claims she was sexually harassed by Park, was also raped by another city official in April, and blamed the Seoul Metropolitan Government for failing to protect her.           Though prosecutors said they indicted the suspect a day before the article ran online, Kim told the JoongAng Ilbo Monday she still thinks prosecutors sat on the case, saying it wasn’t until The Hankyoreh21 journalist called them on Thursday that they filed the indictment.             Kim told the JoongAng Ilbo that prosecutors had told her the suspect would be indicted in July.           Prosecutors denied those claims, saying the alleged rape case was referred by police in June and that the suspect was not physically detained and adamantly refuted the allegations, slowing the investigation.             After receiving the case from police, prosecutors said they pressed an additional charge against the suspect of inflicting physical harm on the victim.           In a series of interviews with local media last weekend, Kim claimed the Seoul government office ignored the victim’s call for stern punishment for the alleged rapist, saying it was only after the victim leaked the case to a local news outlet in late April that the suspect was suspended from his post.           The city confirmed that he was suspended after police launched their investigation into the allegations, and that he remains a government employee.           Kim said she and the secretary decided to speak out publicly about the rape allegation to draw attention to the city government’s “structural problem” in dealing with sexual abuse cases.             The latest allegations come just two months after the Seoul government lost its longest-serving mayor. Park, who served as the Korean capital’s top official since 2011, took his own life on July 9, a day after the secretary filed a sexual harassment complaint against him with the Seoul police.           BY KIM MIN-SANG, LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]                           "
452,Whistle-blower in justice minister scandal requests gov't protection,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, accused of abusing her power, answers questions from the National Assembly during its plenary session on Monday. [YONHAP]               A sergeant who said he witnessed attempts to win preferential treatment for Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae's son from the military on Monday asked the government to protect him as a whistle-blower, according to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.           “We received a report earlier in the morning that the [whistle-blower] requested protection from the commission,” a spokesperson for the commission, the government body overseeing civil complaints, said Monday. “His request is being reviewed by an internal committee at the commission.”           Korean law allows whistle-blowers to seek protection if they have reported their case to the police, prosecution, the commission, Board of Audit (BAI) or any other government body with investigative authority.           “The internal committee will review if the whistle-blower had done this in December [when he divulged information],” the spokesperson said.           The whistle-blower, identified as former Sergeant Hyun, was the first to bring to light the allegations that Choo’s son received preferential treatment during his military service, when he tipped off the opposition lawmakers in time for Choo’s confirmation hearing as justice minister in December.           They alleged that Choo’s son, whose surname is Seo, was let off the hook when he went AWOL in June 2017, taking twice-extended medical leave for knee surgery. Seo served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018.           They claimed Seo broke rules in the process of extending his leave by calling his base, rather than obtaining additional permission from a military hospital. Anonymous whistle-blowers have since told media outlets that Choo, at the time chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), or one of her aides called the military to ask for the extension, and that the military also faced pressure to select Seo as one of interpreters for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.           By January, opposition lawmakers had reported to prosecutors the allegations that Choo abused her power and that Seo deserted his military post without consent. Choo and Seo have denied the allegations.             As the investigation continued during the intervening months, the identification of the first whistle-blower came under scrutiny over the weekend, when DP Rep. Hwang Hee revealed the full name of the former sergeant in a Facebook post. After intense backlash, he edited the former sergeant’s full name from the post and instead identified him as “Sergeant Hyun.”             However, Hwang told the JoongAng Ilbo on Sunday that Sergeant Hyun’s full name had already been used in the media previously.             “TV Chosun has used his full name and even aired his face to the whole country when they released their interview with him [in February],” Hwang said. “People who are saying that I revealed the full name first are saying that only to attack me.”           Hyun is said to have requested media outlets recently to refrain from airing his previous interviews.           “Hwang described the whistle-blower like a criminal, slandered his good name and is trying to threaten and shut down his attempts to speak out about the matter,” opposition People Power Party (PPP) floor leader Joo Ho-young said during a committee meeting on Monday. “As soon as Hwang revealed the whistle-blower’s name, he was heavily attacked online by supporters of the Moon Jae-in administration.”           Joo added that he will report Hwang to the Assembly’s Special Committee on Ethics for attempting to slander the whistle-blower.            The Assembly’s committee on ethics has the authority to investigate whether a lawmaker has violated any rules in the National Assembly Act and can take disciplinary action against a lawmaker found guilty, including banning the lawmaker from entering a session at the Assembly for up to 30 days.           In the ongoing probe, prosecutors summoned last week Hyun, two lieutenants and a colonel as witnesses in the case.             Seo was summoned on Sunday, the first time since the probe’s launch in January. The questioning was conducted behind doors and only became known after the prosecution announced it on Monday.             Earlier on Sunday, Choo, who has remained publicly reticent to discuss the issue, posted about it on her Facebook account, apologizing to the public for causing trouble but adding that there was “no violation of procedures” when it came to her son’s extended medical leave.             The Defense Ministry said in a statement last week that Seo did not violate any regulations in extending his medical leave by a phone call. It has since been receiving calls, some angry, from parents with their children in the military service.           “A lot of them were calling to complain, saying that they couldn’t extend their sons’ medical leave when they were ill during service,” a source in the ministry told the JoongAng Ilbo on Monday on the condition of anonymity. “But not all of them were angry calls. Some were genuinely interested in if and how they could extend their leaves as well.”           At the plenary session of the Assembly on Monday, Choo was summoned several times to the podium to be questioned about the allegations by lawmakers.           BY ESTHER CHUNG, HA JUN-HO, LEE CHUL-JAE   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "
453,Fourth supplementary budget pushed by the prime minister,"

                  Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Monday requested the National Assembly's swift approval of an extra budget worth 7.8 trillion won ($6.6 billion) proposed to cushion the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.           ""I want the National Assembly to quickly review and approve the extra budget bill the government has submitted so that people in need can receive assistance possibly before the Chuseok holiday,"" Chung said in his address to the National Assembly.           The government will be bracing itself for ""immediate execution"" of the special budget as soon as it wins final parliamentary approval, he said.           ""Through this, [the government] will do its best to bolster people's livelihoods before and after the Chuseok holiday and support the economic recovery in the second half of the year,"" he said.           Last week, the government submitted the extra budget bill to parliament, the fourth supplementary government spending drawn up to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.           The latest extra budget, proposed in light of the virus resurgence since mid-August, aims to assist smaller business owners, in particular, those that have been hit hard by tighter social distancing measures, including limits on the operations of restaurants, coffee shops and sports facilities.           The ruling Democratic Party (DP), controlling 176 seats of the 300-member parliament, is seeking to have the bill pass through a National Assembly plenary meeting on Friday.           ""I am well aware that there are some voices of concern over fiscal soundness in relation to the four rounds of extra budget this year,"" the prime minister said. But the country is ""in an unprecedented national crisis"" that requires an unprecedentedly bold response, he added.           The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) warned that it will not cooperate in the bill's parliamentary passage if the government's plan to provide all citizens aged 13 and older with 20,000 won mobile service fee assistance is not retracted.           Yonhap               "

455,Train ticket sales plummet ahead of first 'untact' Chuseok,"

     Korea Railroad employees implement disinfection measures at Seoul Station. [KORAIL]                There are already signs that things are going to be very different for this year's Chuseok holiday, as many people cancel the traditional trip home in favor of staying socially distanced at home.           It's already clear that people have taken the advice not to travel this Chuseok, which starts on Sept. 30, to heart, with train ticket reservations — normally quite literally the hottest ticket in town — dramatically down.            Signs that less people expect to be back in their hometowns for the traditional jesa ceremony and visits to ancestors' graves can also be seen in a marked increase in demand for grave care services.           This change in Chuseok plans isn't necessarily seen as bad news by everybody. Many of the nation's daughter-in-laws — generally expected to go to their husband's parents' home for the holiday, often with the expectation that a significant amount of cooking and housework will be taken care of — might be breathing a sigh of relief.           Younger Koreans in general seem less willing to take the risk of traveling this year. One joke trending online at the moment plays on the Korean portmanteau ""untact,"" combining the prefix ""un"" with the word contact, meaning contactless.           ""Your ancestors are already untact,"" the joke goes. ""But if you contract the coronavirus, you could end up in direct contact.""           The message is clear — people don't feel that there is a need to physically travel somewhere to honor their ancestors this Chuseok, and doing so could be a dangerous, or even fatal, decision.           “My in-laws are in South Gyeongsang, so we travel by train every year to visit them. But this year, we didn’t even look into train tickets,” said one office worker who wished to remain anonymous. “I am just waiting for a call from my mother-in-law telling us not to come.”          This year’s Chuseok will be the first major Korean holiday with social distancing measures in effect, and, although it's an especially long holiday this year as it runs straight into a weekend, ticket reservations have fallen to half of last year's number.            “The last time I told my in-laws I could not visit them for the holiday was during my last month of pregnancy,” said Ms. Park, an employee at a distribution company in Seoul. “My mother-in-law told me not to bother coming over for this year’s Chuseok.”             A joint survey conducted by job search portals Job Korea and Albamon on 855 office workers showed that 30.8 percent will stay home as much as possible. The average travel expenses for office workers this year are estimated to be around 350,000 won ($300), about 30,000 won less than last year.           As the holiday approaches, companies are struggling to create protocols for employee travel. SK Telecom decided to halt its annual employee Chuseok bus service this year. An employee at SK Telecom said the move was an effort to prevent the spread of Covid-19.           SK Telecom's bus decision appears to be the most concrete action any company has taken so far, as most companies are looking to the government for guidance. Actively discouraging employees from taking part in one of the most important holidays in the Korean company isn't a step they want to have to take.           “Encouraging travel will likely upset the employees, but not taking any action will not make a great impression on the government, so it is a dilemma,” said a human resources team leader at a subsidiary of a major firm.          A lot of people obviously aren't waiting for their companies to make a decision, as can already be seen through sales of gifts and services.            The grave care business is seeing an increase in demand compared to last year, as there are already more than 46,000 reservations with several weeks left until Chuseok. People would normally visit and tidy the graves of their parents or grandparents during the holiday.           At department stores, sales of luxury gifts have already surpassed last year. Hyundai Department Store has seen sales of its Korean beef set, priced around 800,000 won, more than triple. Emart has increased its supply of Korean beef sets by 30 percent.           “There are now more people that decided to send gifts in lieu of visits — the untact Chuseok season has become the mainstream,” said a spokesperson for Hyundai Department Store.             The Ministry of the Interior and Safety will roll out a service on Sept. 21 called “Ehaneul,” an online ‘untact’ program for visiting ancestral graves. The service lets users create images of the traditional memorial service tables for jesa and share them with their extended families.           BY KANG KI-HEON   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

Around 165 billion won ($139 million) of commissions will be lost. The waiver is limited to trades in Kospi and Kosdaq stocks and some derivative products.             Products traded outside of local trading hours, such as the Euro Stoxx 50 futures, Kospi 200 futures and dollar futures, will not benefit from the fee cut.             The waiver includes the 0.0027 percent of the trading value taken by the KRX and the 0.0009 percent taken by the KSD in clearing fees.           Brokerages charge commissions for handling the transactions, but many mobile brokerages already charge nothing, while other brokerages are eliminating their commissions in line with the cuts by the exchange and the depository.           Eugene Investment said Monday the firm will be waiving its commissions.           A 0.25 percent transaction tax will remain for all sales on the exchange.           The plan by the exchange and the depository may not lead to more trading as commissions are already close to zero.

457,Digital banking revolution creates employment gold rush,"

     [JOONGANG ILBO]               While many companies have either canceled or cut back on hiring due to coronavirus uncertainties, at least one type of business is struggling with a labor shortage.           Internet-only banks are promising fat paychecks and a shorter-than-ever hiring process to bring in as many IT developers to get ahead in the digital transformation of finance.             K Bank posted a job notice on Sept. 11 seeking data specialists and IT developers by the end of the month. The company plans to recruit by double-digit numbers in 10 areas, including banking development and operations. It needs people to develop systems for deposits, installment savings, foreign exchange, loans and data processing.             ""We are looking for talent to innovate K Bank’s ICT sector,"" said Ok Sung-hwan, head of K Bank's management planning division.           A few days earlier, Toss offered exceptional benefits — a 100-million-won ($85,000) stock options and a salary increase of 150 percent — for IT developers to head Toss Bank, which is to be up and running next year at the earliest.           Kakao Bank posted a job notice on Sept. 4 seeking IT developers to head its data analysis platform and core banking divisions. Kakao Bank promised flexible working hours, one month of guaranteed paid vacation and two million won of vacation allowance.             The three internet banks are hiring experienced developers at the same time to create apps, mobile systems and data systems. Tellers and service workers are not in demand.             This aggressive move is to prepare for the MyData project, a government-led project that allows financial institutions to gather scattered data from retail companies to create customized services. The banks are gearing up for the selection of MyData financial institutions in February and want to have the right people in place in order to be chosen.           They expect the demand to continue for several years.             Internet-only banks are also feeling the need to improve the user experience of their apps as fast as possible, to catch up with commercial banks that already have decades more experience in the business. Competition has especially been heated after the introduction of the open banking system, which allows customers to withdraw, transfer and keep track of their assets at all institutions participating through one app.             According to the Korea Financial Telecommunications & Clearings Institute (KFTC), the number of open banking subscribers in Korea stood at 40 million as of July, which is 72 percent of the country's economically active population.           Rapid recruitment characterizes the recent push.           Kakao Bank finished both the first and second round of interviews in one day. For other companies, this process takes at least a month to finish. Toss aims to complete the entire process — from application to final hiring — in less than three weeks. K Bank is planning for two weeks.             The developers are seen as the VIPs of the business as they must be hired before someone else gets to them.           Commercial banks have been late to the game as they struggle with the pandemic. Shinhan Bank and Woori Bank posted recruitment notices Monday, with most entry level positions focused on IT development and data analysts.           BY SUNG JI-WON, KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]               "

I had to consider every day this could happen,” Mattis told journalist Bob Woodward about that period, as U.S. President Donald Trump was threatening “fire and fury” against North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile provocations that year.           “This was not a theoretical concern.”           Months later such apprehension would give way to shock and awe of a different kind, when Trump began one of the oddest political romances in history with the regime’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un.           Written with unprecedented access to Trump, Woodward’s new book, “Rage,” describes the relationship as “personal and emotional” — embodied in 25 “love letters” exchanged between the two leaders throughout 2018 and 2019 as their countries negotiated the supposed disarmament of the North and its nuclear weapons program.           The letters from Kim were “masterpieces,” Woodward says, adding that they impressed C.I.A. analysts with “the exact mixture of flattery while appealing to Trump’s sense of grandiosity and being center stage in history.”             One such letter, Woodward writes, delivered to Trump by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after his first visit to Pyongyang in April 2018, paved the way to the first Trump-Kim summit in Singapore that June, after which the president declared on Twitter there was “no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""           Though laden with what Woodward calls medieval “declarations of personal fealty,” the duo’s correspondence following Singapore gave them means to outline their conditions prior to another meeting.           In a Sept. 6 letter, for example, Kim declared he was willing to “take further meaningful steps one at a time in a phased manner such as the complete shutdown of the Nuclear Weapons Institute or the Satellite Launch District and the irreversible closure of the nuclear materials production facility,” Woodward writes.           Woodward gives no further details as to what Kim asked for in return in the letter.            But the proposal to undertake the process gradually was again presented by Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, at the second summit in February 2019, where he offered to scrap the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center in exchange for sanctions relief on five counts particularly damaging to the country’s economy.           Trump rejected the offer, Woodward writes, instead calling on Kim to give up all of the regime’s nuclear sites, which Trump said numbered five.           “The look on Kim’s face was utter shock” as Trump walked out of their summit prematurely, without signing an agreement or even attending a state dinner, according to Woodward.             Though the Hanoi debacle left negotiations in a deadlock from which they have yet to recover, the two leaders’ further correspondence enabled a third meeting in June 2019, after Trump extended an invitation to meet with Kim at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) during his visit to South Korea. That event gave Trump his much sought-after photo opportunity, but no substantive outcome, Woodward writes.             Testifying to his disappointment at the lack of progress, Kim wrote his longest letter to Trump on Aug. 5 that year, described by Woodward as sounding like it was from a jilted lover.           Following the usual pleasantries, Kim decried the continuation of combined military exercises between South Korea and the United States, accusing them of targeting the North’s military. Following their first summit, Trump had made public his decision to end joint drills with Seoul.           “Now and in the future, South Korean military cannot be my enemy,” Kim wrote, according to Woodward. “As you mentioned at some point, we have a strong military without the need of special means, and the truth is that South Korean military is no match against my military.”           Kim continued, “I am clearly offended and I do not want to hide this feeling from you. I am really, very offended.”           It is not known what Trump replied to the letter, which he publicly described as “very positive” and “beautiful.” That November, however, the Pentagon announced it had suspended its annual wintertime exercises with the South to support diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang.             Woodward’s account also describes in detail Trump’s distaste for not only the exercises — or “war games” as he called them — but also the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea, which he has repeatedly questioned in public.             Trump at one point even remarked South Korea continues to depend on the United States for its very existence, Woodward writes, noting just how drastically the president’s view of the alliance departed from conventional military belief in Washington. On several occasions, both in Woodward's account and publicly, Trump has questioned the usefulness of the U.S. military alliance with Seoul.            In one anecdote, as he flew over Seoul in his presidential chopper with U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Vincent Brooks during a 2017 state visit to the South, Trump pointed to Samsung’s campus in the city and complained that the United States was “paying for all of this” while South Korea should be.            Brooks attempted to convey South Korea’s extensive financial contribution to the alliance by showing Trump around Camp Humphreys, which was built almost entirely with Seoul’s financing of around $10 billion, but apparently did little to convince the president.           Under Trump, the United States has been negotiating a major hike to South Korea’s contribution to the alliance far beyond the approximately $870 billion Seoul paid in a 2019 agreement for the upkeep of around 28,500 U.S. troops on the peninsula.           But fundamental disagreements over the hike has kept the talks frozen for months, and its outcome hinges upon the results of Trump’s re-election bid in November.           Interestingly, Pyongyang’s objections may be less of an obstacle to the future of U.S. military presence on the peninsula than Trump’s personal views. According to Woodward, Pompeo concluded Kim wanted U.S. troops in the South because “they were a restraint on China” — an opinion which the North’s past leaders have conveyed to Washington in past occasions.           As a whole, Woodward credits Trump for averting war with North Korea through his unconventional diplomacy with Kim, though he maintains doubt about the sustainability of this relationship post-Trump.           With the president’s mind fixated on his dwindling re-election prospects, Pyongyang has reverted to a state of hostility, severing its ties with the South and demolishing its liaison office with Seoul.             But like Trump, it, too, has faced a seemingly intractable problem in the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced it to shut its borders with China, its main trade partner.             According to Woodward, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger believed in February that the coronavirus was “probably doing more to advance our maximum pressure campaign [against North Korea] than anything at the moment,” signaling a confidence that the virus may bring Pyongyang to its knees faster than U.S. pressure.             “Rage” is set to be published in the United States on Tuesday. It is Woodward’s second book on the Trump administration, after “Fear,” released in 2018.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
460,Freedom from Covid restrictions isn't enough for some,"






     Customers return to a coffee shop chain in downtown Seoul on Monday, the first day after the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures were lifted for the greater Seoul area. [NEWS1]         The central government’s lifting of the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for the greater Seoul area drew mixed reactions Monday, as owners of “high-risk” businesses forced to close for two more weeks clamored to reopen.           A coalition of noraebang (singing room) owners in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi slammed the government for forcing their businesses to remain shut while allowing restaurants and coffee shops to resume normal operations. They vowed to seek compensation for financial losses and file a complaint against the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) for dereliction of duty.           The threat came as Korea added 109 new cases of the coronavirus Sunday, down from 121 the day before, the 12th consecutive day that daily infections hovered between 100 and 200.           A slew of restrictions that impacted the daily lives of Koreans residing in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeoggi — together called the greater Seoul area or the Seoul metropolitan area — were finally lifted on Sunday midnight after two weeks, as central health authorities admitted the measures were heightening “social fatigue” among the general public.             The plight of owners of restaurants, bars, bakeries, coffee shops, fitness centers and hagwon (private cram schools) that were either forced to close or make serious alterations to their services — leading to plunges in sales — were another critical factor in why the Level 2.5 restrictions were lifted.           Yet health authorities said Sunday that Level 2 measures in the three-tier social distancing system would remain in place for two more weeks in the greater Seoul area, a week longer than the rest of the country.                              Seoul and Gyeonggi have been subject to Level 2 since Aug. 16, and Incheon since Aug. 18. The rest of the nation has been subject to Level 2 since Aug. 23.             Under Level 2, any private or indoor gatherings involving 50 people or more, or outdoor meetings involving 100 people or more, are banned. Eleven types of businesses that are deemed to have high risks of virus transmission are closed, including clubs, bars that involve dancing or table-hopping, door-to-door sales businesses, buffets and noraebang. Public institutions such as museums and libraries are also shut down.           A 61-year-old noraebang owner surnamed Kim, who wished not to be identified by his full name, said he was “reaching his limit.”           “How do you really define ‘high risk’?” he asked, saying the government’s criteria for categorizing high-risk businesses were vague. After a month of forced closure, Kim said he was making ends meet by working half-time at a gimbap (seaweed rice roll) store, earning minimum wage.           The Seoul Metropolitan Government said Monday that city buses that have run at longer intervals after 9 p.m. from Aug. 31 will return to their normal schedules. But restrictions on some of the most popular parks along the Han River will stay in place in order to prevent people from mingling in groups, the city said, affecting the river parks of Yeouido, Ttukseom and Banpo.           The city also extended its ban on rallies involving 10 people or more until Oct. 11 midnight, effectively prohibiting right-wing civic groups from holding demonstrations over the Chuseok holidays, Oct. 3 Foundation Day and Oct. 9 Hangul Day.           Of the 109 new cases Sunday, 98 were local infections, including 41 in Seoul, 30 in Gyeonggi, 10 in Incheon, seven in South Chungcheong, three each in Busan and Gwangju and one each in Daegu, Daejeon, Ulsan and South Gyeongsang.             Out of 11 imported cases, six were from Uzbekistan, two from the Philippines and one each from India, Qatar and Myanmar.             Five people died Sunday, bringing total deaths to 363, while 263 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 18,489.             As of Sunday at midnight, Korea had counted 22,285 coronavirus patients in all.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN, KWON HYE-RIM   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

462,Lawmaker at center of 'comfort women' scandal indicted,"

     Rep. Yoon Mee-hyang of the Democratic Party (DP).  [YONHAP]                Rep. Yoon Mee-hyang of the ruling party, a renowned activist for survivors of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, was indicted on Monday for misappropriating donations intended to help the victims, commonly known as “comfort women.""           The Seoul Western District Prosecutors’ Office said it has indicted Yoon, a proportional lawmaker of the Democratic Party (DP) on eight charges including fraud, embezzlement and breach of trust.             Before being elected as a lawmaker for the ruling party, Yoon was the head of The Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan. She came under intense scrutiny in May, following public accusations by Lee Yong-soo, a comfort woman survivor and longtime activist for the victims, who alleged that Yoon had exploited her and other survivors for decades.             After a four-month investigation, the prosecution announced its decision to indict Yoon on Monday afternoon. Yoon was attending a National Assembly session when the indictment was announced and quickly left the legislature without expressing her position.           She has consistently denied the allegations against her, resisting pressure from the public and the opposition parties to give up her lawmaker seat over the scandal. Yoon issued a statement Monday evening maintaining her innocence on each of the charges against her.           The prosecution accused Yoon of misappropriating more than 100 million won ($84,533) intended to support the comfort women survivors and operate the Korean Council. She instead used the money for her private uses, according to the indictment.             Yoon allegedly collected donations in five personal bank accounts and told donors that she would use the money for the funeral of a deceased survivor and to pay for survivors’ overseas travels, but ultimately embezzled 57.55 million won of the donations.             The prosecution also said Yoon embezzled 20.98 million won from the account of the Korean Council and another 21.82 million won from the operations account of a shelter in Mapo District of western Seoul and used the money for her personal expenses.            Yoon was also indicted on a charge of quasi-fraud against a 92-year-old survivor who is suffering from serious dementia.             The prosecution accused Yoon of having taken advantage of a physically and mentally incapacitated survivor, and forcing her to donate a total of 79.2 million won to the Korean Council between November 2017 and January of this year.           According to the prosecution, a senior employee at the Korean Council was also indicted on Monday as Yoon’s co-conspirator. Yoon and the official were indicted for collecting a total of 4.1 billion won in donations from the public from 2015 through 2019 without registering their campaign with the government authorities. Prosecutors did not name the alleged co-conspirator.           The prosecutors said Yoon had also committed a breach of trust to the Korean Council.             Under Yoon’s leadership, the Korean Council spent 750 million won out of Hyundai Heavy Industries’ 1 billion won donation in 2012 to purchase a house in Anseong, Gyeonggi, supposedly to use the property as a shelter for survivors. Purchased from an acquaintance of one of her friends, the house was sold at the price of 420 million won in April this year.           Through that arrangement, Yoon offered financial gains to the buyer while incurring loss to the Korean Council, the prosecution said.           Yoon was also accused of operating an illegal lodging business at the house. Without registering with local authorities, Yoon rented the house out to civic groups, political parties and individuals on more than 50 occasions, receiving a total of 9 million won from them from 2014 through 2019.             According to previous media reports, the shelter was rarely used by the survivors while it was owned by the Korean Council, which Yoon conceded in her statement Monday.           Yoon was also indicted on charges of falsifying a document, which allowed the Korean Council to receive about 300 million won in museum subsidies from the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Seoul Metropolitan Government from 2013 till 2020.           Yoon falsely stated the organization's exhibition center had a curator, according to prosecutors, allowing it to be classified as a museum and making the organization eligible for the subsidies.           The opposition People Power Party (PPP) expressed satisfaction with Yoon's indictment on Monday.           “She used the survivors for her private gains and betrayed the people who supported the survivors,” Rep. Kim Eun-hye, spokeswoman of the PPP, said, while demanding an apology from the ruling party for having protected Yoon.           The DP did not immediately issue any statement about the indictment on Monday.            BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]                 "

464,Samsung may have won Snapdragon 875 chipset order,"

             Samsung Electronics will be the sole supplier of Qualcomm's next generation chipset, according to unconfirmed media reports, suggesting that the company's problems with the latest semiconductor manufacturing technology may have been overcome.             It has been expected that some of the order for the Snapdragon 875, as the chipset is known, would be filled by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).           Unnamed sources quoted in local media said that the processor chip will utilize Samsung’s 5 nanometer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography process. Samsung Electronics declined to confirm the news.           Qualcomm’s new chipset, due to be released in December this year, will be deployed in phones from Samsung Electronics as well as those from Xiaomi and Oppo.             If the deal is confirmed, it would be the first time Samsung Electronics has been able to win the whole order from Qualcomm for its latest generation chipset.           Samsung Electronics has been facing a yield problem with its 5 nanometer EUV process, but the electronics maker said during a conference call in July that it is on track to improve the yield rate.           TSMC has been the main chipset supplier to Qualcomm using 7 nanometer technology, with Samsung Electronics trailing in terms of price and cost competitiveness.           The news came a week after reports that Samsung Electronics won the contract to manufacture Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 4-series chipset, which is designed for smartphones with lower price tags.             Samsung won an order from IBM earlier this month to manufacture the American company’s Power10 processor, using its 7 nanometer EUV process. IBM confirmed that Samsung Electronics has been given the order for the chip, to be released in the second half of 2021.             EUV is a technology that allows for more defined printing of patterns on a chip and the cramming of more components per area. Samsung and TSMC are the only chipmakers capable of using the EUV process.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
465,Blue House defends phone bill subsidy despite broad criticism,"

     A bicyclist moves in front of a smartphone store on Thursday. President Moon Jae-in said last week that the government will pay a 20,000 won ($17) subsidy to the smartphone users as a 'token of affection' to the people who are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic.  [YONHAP]                A top presidential aide on Monday defended the government’s controversial plan to spend 928 billion won ($784 million) to fund one-time subsidies for phone bills, an initiative that has prompted criticism by both the opposition parties and the public.           “If a family has three or four people who are older than middle school students, they can together save 60,000 won or 80,000 won on their telecommunication bills,” said Presidential Senior Secretary for Economic Affairs Lee Ho-seung said in an interview with CBS Radio on Monday. “Is this meaningless, useless support? I don’t think so.”             The government’s proposal would provide a 20,000-won subsidy for smartphone bills to anyone above the age of 13. The money would go directly to the phone companies.           Chairman Lee Nak-yon of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) made a proposal to include the subsidy in the fourth supplementary budget during the party leaders’ meeting with President Moon Jae-in on Wednesday. Moon agreed to push it forward, saying on Thursday that it is the government's ""token of affection"" to people who are struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.            When the government, Blue House and the DP agreed earlier this month to formulate the fourth supplementary budget, worth up to 8 trillion won, they said it will be 100 percent financed by issuing state bonds.             The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) has adamantly opposed the smartphone bill subsidy, questioning its effectiveness.           “This is insane,” Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the PPP said Friday. “We will make sure to fix this during the budget review at the National Assembly.”             The initiative also got a cold reception from the public. In a poll conducted by the Realmeter on Friday and published Monday, 58.2 percent of respondents said the plan is “wrong,” and 37.8 percent said the plan is “good.” The poll has a 95 percent confidence level, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.             “This is a classic example of indiscriminate pork barrel spending,” Rep. Choo Kyung-ho of the PPP said Monday in an interview with MBC Radio. “Ahead of the Chuseok holiday, the government abruptly decided to spend nearly 1 trillion won of tax money to support phone bills.”           Choo has also been critical of the government’s demand to pass a fourth supplementary budget bill before the Chuseok holiday, which falls on Oct. 1 this year. Scrapping the phone bill subsidy plan is a precondition for opposition lawmakers’ cooperation on that budget, he said.             “Normally it takes two to three weeks for the lawmakers to deliberate on a supplementary budget bill,” Choo, who once served as the vice minister of finance, said. “The administration and the ruling party want to spend nearly 8 trillion won by creating state debt, and we must never hastily approve it. The National Assembly is not the administration’s subcontractor that has to follow its schedule.”             “Instead of spending money on telephone bills, the government should spend the money to offer free flu vaccines to more people to bolster coronavirus preventive measures,” Choo said. This year, flu vaccines are offered free to those who are 18 or younger, and who are 62 or older.             Another PPP lawmaker told the JoongAng Ilbo that the government plans to spend about 1 billion won to operate a temporary support center to give away the phone bill subsidy, in addition to the subsidies themselves.           According to Rep. Her Eon-a, the Ministry of Science and ICT originally asked for a 928 billion won budget to pay a one-off 20,000 won payment to 4.64 million people. In addition, it asked for another 946 million won to operate a support center.           According to the plan, a temporary support center would be operated for two months and would employ 44 people, collectively making more than 275 million won.             Another 109 million won has been requested to hire other support staff, and the ministry asked for 130 million won to rent office spaces. It asked for another 218 million won for public affairs of the program.             “The government said it will spend nearly 1 trillion won in tax money for a phone bill subsidy, and then it wants to spend another 1 billion won of tax money to operate that project,” she said. “The government is issuing bonds to raise funds. Is it acceptable to recklessly spend money?”             Top politicians from the ruling party also questioned the effectiveness of the phone bill subsidy.             Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung said last week that it is regretful that the subsidy will have no effect in boosting sales for self-employed people who operate small businesses.           “The money will go straight to telecom companies,” he said. “But it is inappropriate for me to challenge the party’s decision.”             South Gyeongsang Gov. Kim Kyoung-soo proposed expanding free Wi-Fi networks, instead.             In the CBS interview on Monday, Senior Secretary Lee dismissed their opinions.           “When we pay the phone bills, the people will end up with the saved money in their bank accounts,” Lee said. “This is the most effective way to give away the funds.”             Lee also said the phone payments are important amid the pandemic because they serve a critical role for the country's social distancing campaign, allowing students to study online and employees to work from home.             Lee said the government will listen to the opinions of the National Assembly, but he made clear that the administration has no intention to back down.           “We have made this decision after serious discussions,” he said.                   BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

[BIFF]                The organizing committee of the 25th Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) apologized for the sudden delay of the largest annual international film festival in Korea, but said that the decision was inevitable.            “It’s a shame that after waiting for a year, we are seeing each other [online] wearing masks, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Lee Yong-kwan, the chairman of the festival’s board of directors in an online press event on Monday. “From May, we’ve tried to host the festival normally in line with social distancing Level 1, but due to a sudden change of circumstances [meaning a recent spike], for over a month now we’ve deliberated over whether or not we could actually host the festival. [The board] decided that it was crucial to be careful about [the possibility] of another spike of daily coronavirus cases during the Chuseok holidays, and we had no choice but to postpone the event for two weeks.           “Please understand that we’ve reached the decision after much consideration, and that it was inevitable,” Lee emphasized.             With Covid-19 infections refusing to die down since August, the BIFF committee announced on Friday that the festival will be postponed for two weeks and that all offline events including the opening and closing ceremonies, panel discussions and outdoor events are canceled. Receptions, parties and networking events for global filmmakers and organizers were also canceled. Instead the festival will focus on screening the invited films at the Busan Cinema Center.             A total of 192 films from 68 countries were invited to this year’s festival.             “We have decided to screen the precious 190 films that we have received from Asia and Europe at the Busan Cinema Center,” executive director Jeon Yang-jun said. “We’ll do our best for the screenings to be held offline until the end of the festival. The selections will be screened once per film.""           The opening film is an omnibus titled “The Story of Hong Kong” by seven prestigious Hong Kong filmmakers such as Sammo Hung and Tsui Hark. The film portrays Hong Kong in different eras from the 1950s to the present day. Japanese filmmaker  Kotaro Tamura’s “Josee, the Tiger and the Fish” was selected to be the closing film. The film is the animated version of Isshin Inudo’s 2003 film.             BIFF also left open the possibility for the festival to be canceled completely if social distancing remains at Level 2 or higher.             “If Covid-19 gets worse, I think we will have to cancel the festival,” Lee said. “We are not prepared to move the event online, and since our invited films are centered on world premieres, it would be difficult to adjust the films to be screened online.             “If such a situation does arrive, we will look for more possible ways [for audiences to see films]. We have deeply felt the need for the festival to come up with substitute interactive methods in this 'untact' society. If we are not able to host this year’s festival, we will not look for ways to transit to online. Our principles are similar to Cannes. We have to take into consideration basic orders such as the films’ copyrights, filmmakers’ and audience’s decision.”           The 25th event is currently scheduled to take place from Oct. 21 to 30.            BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "

     A vehicle lines up at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market in southern Seoul on Sept. 11 to pick up an order. The market resumed its drive-up service on Sept. 11 after first having adopted it in March. [YONHAP]               Drive-up or curbside delivery is becoming ever more popular despite the end of Level 2.5 restrictions on Sunday night.          With the service, customers wait in their cars in front a cafe, restaurant or store and their orders are brought to them by staff.           The number of people dining out has dramatically decreased due to the recent resurgence of the virus, but the number of vehicles lining up outside of restaurants or cafes has jumped, especially during the commuting hours and lunch time. Starbucks has an employee that helps drivers with their parking.           Starting Monday, Lotte Hotel Busan added five more meals that can be picked up in the parking lot. They used to be available only at the hotel restaurant, but the hotel changed the rule as dining in has become more difficult.           CU is beginning its own drive-up service next month, working with the Owin mobility app.           Customers will be able to place an order on the app and designate a CU store for the handoff. Once they reach the destination, an employee will come out with the merchandise.             The customer can set their estimated arrival time.           Other retailers, including Emart and Homeplus, are providing similar services. Homeplus is offering drive-up at 26 of its stores, and Emart is doing the same at its branch in Wangsimni, eastern Seoul.             At Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, a drive-up service was restarted last week after it was tested in March.             Sliced raw fish, seasoned skate and deep-fried shrimp are just a few of the offerings that can be purchased and picked up curbside. Drive-up customers receive a 20 percent discount.             Drive-up orders have been increasing, and as a result, companies are expanding their capacity to meet demand.           From January through April, the number of drive-up orders at Starbucks jumped 40 percent on year. From Jan. 1 through April 30, sales of drive-up and McDelivery accounted for 54 percent of McDonald’s Korea sales. Around 20 million vehicles visited McDonald’s for drive-up in the first half of the year.           Customers who experienced ""delivery and drive-through as a result of Covid-19 are likely to continue the consumption pattern in the future,” said Prof. Seo Yong-gu, who teaches business at Sookmyung Women’s University.           BY JIN MIN-JI, BAE JUNG-WON   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleDelivery market continues to grow, but drivers can't keep upGS25 expands late-night delivery service as sales soar"

471,Gas stations shutting as sales decline and policy weighs,"

     A customer pumps gas at a gas station in Seoul on Aug. 2. Some 70 gas stations in Korea went out of business over the past six months. [NEWS1]                Some 70 gas stations in Korea went out of business over the past six months amid the pandemic.             According to Opinet, a website on oil price information run by Korea National Oil Corporation, Korea had about 11,384 gas stations as of Sept. 9, down 70 from March. For full-year 2019, a total of 80 gas stations went out of business.             The biggest reason for the shutdowns is a sharp drop in sales.             Sales at gas stations declined by 2.56 percent in the January to July period on year, according to data collected by the Korea Oil Station Association. The sale of diesel decreased by 3.25 percent, while the sale of gasoline dropped by 0.38 percent.           Heavy rains were also blamed.           In July, the sale of diesel, which is usually needed for tour buses, declined 4.57 percent compared to the same period in 2019.               Going out of business is also not an easy option for gas station operators.           In order to demolish a gas station, the operator must clean up the soil, which is often polluted. It costs them about 100 million won ($84,500) to 200 million won to shut a station.           Gas-station operators are appealing to the government for assistance. According to them, their financial difficulties are not completely unrelated to the renewable-energy policies of the administration.           BY LEE JI-YOUNG   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

[Burberry]         According to Burberry, it is an adjustable and reusable antibacterial cotton mask that has a particle filtration efficiency of filtering out 99 percent of the size of 0.1-micrometer dust particles. The 140,000 won ($120) mask with the brand’s signature check pattern comes in two colors: beige and pale blue. A portion of sales will be donated to the Burberry Foundation Covid-19 Community Fund run by the Burberry Foundation.           “We are proud to be donating 20 percent from the selling price of each face mask to the Burberry Foundation Covid-19 Community Fund operated by The Burberry Foundation to support communities impacted by the pandemic globally,” the brand said.              British luxury fashion brand Mulberry released four designs of its commercial masks on Sept. 2. [Mulberry]         Another British luxury fashion brand, Mulberry, has released four designs of commercial masks earlier this month.             ""Its double-layered mask is made out of 100 percent organic cotton with an antibacterial coating, has excellent ventilation and can be reused several times thanks to its water-repellent finish,"" the company said.           American fashion brand Ralph Lauren will release both cloth and filtration masks on Sept. 15, which cost $39 and $49, respectively. The multilayered mask with a polyester shell and an inner lining lets users change the disposable filter easily, and the size is customizable so that the mask perfectly contours to the shape of the wearer’s face.           “All profits from the sale of the masks will be donated to the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO [the World Health Organization], powered by the UN Foundation, and the sales in the Taiwan region will be donated to a local beneficiary,” Ralph Lauren said.           While the brand's signature designs are the most obvious features that differentiate them from disposable masks, they are also more comfortable to wear than disposable masks as fashion companies produce their masks based on three-dimensional design tactics. By utilizing the latest fiber technology, additional features such as odor removing filters can also be applied.           However, there are voices of concern that say such fashion masks are not effective in filtering out the virus. Even if it is a reusable cloth mask, only those with replaceable filters are said to be safe. The best way to check whether a commercial face mask is safe is to look for the administrative markings that indicate its features.                  BY YOO JI-YOEN, KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

During RB Leipzig’s first round match at the DFB-Pokal Cup against Nurnberg at Max-Morlock-Stadion in Nuremberg, Germany, on Saturday, Hwang scored his first goal with his new team.           While Leipzig was leading 2-0, Hwang scored in the 90th minute to extend his side’s lead to a 3-0 victory.            The game against Nurnberg was the team's first competitive game of the new season, ahead of the start of the Bundesliga on Sept. 20. Hwang joined Leipzig on a five-year contract in July after spells at Hamburger SV and FC Liefering. His first goal for his new club literally couldn't have come any earlier.           Along with his first goal, Hwang left a strong impression in his debut performance, picking up an assist as well for Yussuf Poulsen’s goal in the 67th minute.           With the win, RB Leipzig cruised to the second round of the DFB-Pokal, with the next round to take place just before Christmas, either on Dec. 22 or 23.           RB Leipzig will play their first Bundesliga match of the 2020-21 season against Mainz on Sunday, Sept. 20, at Red Bull Arena Leipzig.           Hwang wasn't the only Korean footballer finding the net in the DFC-Pokal.           Lee Jae-sung of Holstein Kiel also scored during his side’s first round match against Rielasingen at Holstein-Stadion on Sunday.           While second-tier Bundesliga club Holstein Kiel was leading 2-1, Lee scored in the 22nd and 24th minutes to extend Holstein’s lead to 4-1.

Throughout six innings, Ryu gave up eight hits and one run while striking out seven with no walks.           Hoping to redeem himself from his worst start of the season against the New York Yankees the last time out, Ryu took to the mound in 19-mile-per-hour (31-kilometer-per-hour) winds.            Ryu struggled to adapt to the conditions at the start of the game, giving up a run at the top of the first inning with an RBI single to left fielder Dominic Smith on a line drive to center field, allowing the Mets second baseman Jeff McNeil to score the first run of the game.           Once again, the Blue Jays batting lineup had Ryu's back. At the bottom of the second inning, Blue Jays’ left fielder Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit a two-run home run off Mets’ starter David Peterson’s change-up, pitched at a speed of 84.7 miles per hour.             “After I’d given up that early run in the first inning, I had to tweak my game plan and the pitch sequences,” Ryu was quoted as saying on MLB.com. “I thought they were on top of the pitches I was making.”           That change in sequence seemed to have worked. From the second inning, Ryu continued to toss scoreless innings and was lifted from the mound after the top of the sixth inning, when the Blue Jays had a 2-1 lead.           The Blue Jays’ batting lineup continued their strong performance with a big inning at the bottom of the sixth, scoring five runs for a 7-1 lead.           The Mets scored two runs at the top of the eighth, but the Blue Jays were already well out in front.             With the Blue Jays’ strong performance, Ryu picked up his fourth win of the season and another quality start, and the Blue Jays picked up a 7-3 victory. This game allowed Ryu to lower his ERA from 3.19 to 3.00.           “Even from now on, I think I’ll have to adapt to different situations inning by inning,” Ryu was quoted as saying. ""I think that really helped me in not giving up hard hits or extra-base hits. That really helped me getting through those runners on base.“           Despite Ryu giving up an early lead, his teammates never lost faith. The Blue Jays are a young squad, and the addition of Ryu seems to have helped the lineup up their game in this shortened season.           “We trust [Ryu] 100 percent,” Blue Jays’ shortstop Santiago Espinal was quoted as saying after the game. “We trust him to get out of trouble and, if he doesn’t, we’ve got his back no matter what. It doesn’t matter. We’ve got his back. Every time he pitches, we’re just trying to go out there and give 100 percent from everybody.”           The Blue Jays seem to have gained tremendous confidence this season. As of Sunday’s game, the Toronto team are second in the American League East standing with 26 wins and 20 losses, just 0.5 games ahead of the New York Yankees.             The Blue Jays’ batting lineup has been explosive this season, picking up a huge victory against the Yankees on Sept. 8 with 10 runs only at the bottom of the sixth inning. This was the first time in 10 years that the Blue Jays have scored 10 runs or more in a single inning, and that performance saved Ryu from picking up his second loss of the season, instead walking away with a no-decision.             The Blue Jays will continue their season with a three-game series against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium in New York starting Tuesday night, or at 8:05 a.m. on Wednesday in Korea.             BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

481,Lee Mi-rim comes from behind for surprise ANA Inspiration win,"

     Lee Mi-rim poses for a photo with her trophy after winning the ANA Inspiration in a sudden-death playoff at the Dinah Shore course at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, on Sunday. [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]                With the mercury pushing 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) on a hot September day in California, Lee Mi-rim picked up her first-ever major title on the LPGA Tour at the ANA Inspiration. And she did so in style.            With three birdies, an eagle and a bogey, Lee shot five under par, 67, on the final day to win the LPGA Tour’s second major tournament of the season at Mission Hills Coutry Club, Dinah Shore Tournament Course in Rancho Mirage, California, on Sunday.             Lee, who started the final round two shots behind co-leaders Brooke M. Henderson of Canada and Nelly Korda of the United States, got off to a quick start by adding her first birdie of the day on the par-4 second.           But as both Henderson and Korda made birdies on the same holes, it seemed unlikely that world No. 94 Lee had a chance of closing the gap. But as co-leaders continued to make birdies, Lee followed doggedly behind with her second birdie of the day on the par-4 sixth, where she chipped in for a birdie.          After she added another birdie on the par-4 12th, she made another chip-in birdie on the par-4 16th. However, as she made a bogey on the par-3 17th, Lee headed into the final hole still two shots behind Korda and one shot behind Henderson.          On the par-5 18th, Lee grabbed her 5-wood and went for the green on her second shot. She missed, and was left with a chip shot for her third shot.            That could very well have been the end for the Korean golfer, leaving her with a very respectable third place, but Lee wasn't finished yet. Defying the odds, she chipped in for an eagle on the final hole to secure herself a spot in a three-way sudden-death playoff. With that eagle on the final hole, Lee finished tied for the lead with a four-day total of 15 under par, 273.           “My plan for 18 was just to have a birdie and do what I have to do to keep my head up,” Lee was quoted as saying on the LPGA website. “And when the shot went in, I think I was really surprised.”           As Lee played two groups ahead of Henderson and Korda, she had to wait for them to finish their rounds. Once the two players finished at 15 under par, Lee was quickly on the phone to her friends back home in Korea.           “My friends said a lot of words of encouragement and do your best, win, and come back home,” Lee told Golf Channel.           That encouragement may have been exactly what she needed.             Heading back to the par-5 18th with Henderson and Korda, Lee wasn't able to replicate the miracle of her last turn on the hole, but she didn't need to. Sticking to her original plan, Lee finished the playoff with a 5-foot birdie putt.           As both Henderson and Korda made pars, Lee was declared the winner of this year’s ANA Inspiration. Remarkably, Lee took the victory without ever leading the field.           “I can’t believe it,” Lee told Golf Channel after her victory. “Honestly, I had no emotions [in the playoff], I just told myself [to] finish this quickly.”           With a victory, Lee took home prize money of $465,000 and her first-ever major title on the LPGA Tour. This is Lee’s fourth LPGA Tour win and is a long awaited one as she hasn’t picked up a win since the Kia Classic back in March 2017. With another playoff win, the 29-year-old improved her LPGA playoff record to two wins and a loss.           Lee's victory looks even more dramatic when looking at her performance at the ANA Inspiration last year. In 2019, Lee was nowhere close to a victory at the ANA Inspiration as she missed the cut. Prior to her victory on Sunday, the 94th-ranked golfer's best finish at the tournament was tied for 11th, back in 2015.            Lee is one of many Korean golfers to join the LPGA Tour after paying on the KLPGA Tour. During her career in Korea, she picked up three wins before joining the LPGA Tour in 2014.             In her rookie season, Lee picked up two victories. Her first win was in August 2014, at the Meijer LPGA Classic, where she won by defeating former world No. 1 Park In-bee in a sudden-death playoff.             Then, in October that year, Lee picked up her second win at the Reignwood LPGA Classic. Following her two wins, it took Lee until 2017 to pick up her third victory on the LPGA Tour.            The ANA Inspiration is normally the first major tournament of the season, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, the tournament was postponed to September and is the second major of the season, after the AIG Women’s Open, also known as the women’s British Open.             Followed by Lee, Amy Yang was the second best Korean golfer in the field as she finished the tournament tied for 15th, with a four-day total of seven under par, 281.             The LPGA Tour will now be heading to Portland, Oregon, to continue its season at the Cambia Portland Classic, scheduled to run from Sept. 17 to 20.             BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

483,Greater Seoul distancing measures relaxed at midnight,"






     Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun presides over a meeting of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters Sunday at the Central Government Complex in Gwanghwamun, downtown Seoul. [NEWS1]         The so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi will be lifted at midnight tonight as originally planned, central health authorities announced Sunday.           That means people in the greater Seoul area will once again be allowed to eat and drink in restaurants and coffee shops past 9 p.m., work out at fitness centers and study at hagwon (private cram schools).             But like the rest of the country, Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi will remain subject to Level 2 measures in the three-tier social distancing system — and for a longer period of time.            Health authorities said the Level 2 measures for the greater Seoul area, also called the Seoul metropolitan area, will tentatively stay in place for two weeks from Sunday midnight to midnight on Sept. 27. The rest of the country will tentatively fall under Level 2 measures through Sept. 20 midnight, after which health officials will decide on the level based on progress made in controlling the outbreak.           Korea’s daily coronavirus cases have hovered between 100 and 200 over the past 11 days, hitting 176 on Thursday, 136 on Friday and 121 on Saturday, according to data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).           While the Seoul metropolitan area will be allowed to enjoy relaxed social distancing measures over the next two weeks, health authorities warned Sunday that the entire nation may fall under stricter measures for two weeks starting Sept. 28 in time for the Chuseok holidays, though specific measures have yet to be determined.             Details for a so-called Special Prevention Period will be discussed as health authorities monitor the overall crisis situation, Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo said in a Sunday press briefing.           Daily new cases of the virus haven’t dropped as low as authorities would like — which is below 100 — but Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said Sunday that the central government decided to lift the Level 2.5 measures nonetheless because, among other reasons, “social fatigue” over the restrictions had been too high.           But that doesn’t mean Level 2 will look exactly the same in the greater Seoul area as before Aug. 23, when the Level 2.5 measures first went into effect.             Cafes, bakeries, ice cream and bingsu (shaved ice) stores that are chain businesses, where people tend to stay for longer periods, have to space out their customers by making them sit diagonally across from each other at tables, or by keeping every other table empty at all times. All customers must wear a face mask except when they're eating or drinking.                               Churches will also not be allowed to hold in-person activities.             These guidelines come on top of Level 2 measures, which affect the entire country. Any private or indoor gatherings involving 50 people or more, or outdoor meetings involving 100 people or more, are banned. Eleven types of “high-risk” businesses are closed, including clubs, bars that involve dancing or table-hopping, door-to-door sales businesses, buffets and noraebang (singing rooms). Public institutions such as museums and libraries are closed.           Though internet cafes are considered a high-risk business, central health authorities said they would be allowed to reopen nationwide, albeit with some new restrictions: minors aren’t allowed, eating is prohibited and customers must space out.           The latest measures were relayed as the KDCA announced 121 new infections of the coronavirus Saturday, 99 of which were local infections, including 30 in Seoul, 27 in Gyeonggi, 14 in Daegu, nine in South Chungcheong, four in Ulsan, three each in Busan and Incheon, two each in Gwangju, Daejeon, North Gyeongsang, South Gyeongsang and one in Gangwon.             Out of 22 cases that were imported, seven were from Uzbekistan, four from India, three from the Philippines, two from Peru and one each from Kazakhstan, Russia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Hungary and Brazil.           Three people died Saturday, bringing total deaths to 358, while 197 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 18,226.             As of Saturday at midnight, Korea had counted 22,176 coronavirus patients in all.             BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
484,Late mayor's accuser says she was raped in April,"

     Kim Jae-ryon, second from left, a lawyer representing a former secretary of the late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, speaks about the secretary’s ordeal during a press conference in Seoul last July. [YONHAP]         A former secretary of the late Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, whom in July rocked the nation with claims she was sexually harassed by Park for years, has come forward with a new allegation that she was raped by another city employee in April.           In an interview with the JoongAng Ilbo last Friday, the secretary’s lawyer, Kim Jae-ryon, said the Seoul Metropolitan Government ignored the victim’s call for punishment of the alleged rapist, adding it was only after the victim leaked the case to a local news outlet that the suspect was suspended from his post — which means he remains a city government official.           Kim said she and the secretary have decided to publicly speak out about the rape allegation in order to point out the city government’s “structural problem” in dealing with sexual abuse cases.             The secretary’s fresh accusation came as a double whammy for the Seoul government, who lost its longest-serving mayor just two months ago. Park, who served as the Korean capital’s top official since 2011, took his own life on July 9, a day after the secretary filed a sexual harassment complaint against him with the Seoul police.           Park left a suicide note at his home apologizing to the public, but it made no mention of what he was sorry for.             In a series of press conferences and statements through Kim, the alleged victim claimed the Seoul Metropolitan Government ignored her numerous calls for help when she told colleagues about Park’s unsolicited sexual advances, such as sending her late-night selfies and lewd text messages.           Seoul officials denied knowing anything about the case. Police launched several investigations, but no critical breakthroughs have yet been made. Upon the victim’s request, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea launched its own probe in late July and is still investigating.           The alleged rape goes back to April 14, a day before the general elections.           According to Kim, the victim, who by that time wasn’t working in Park’s secretariat office, was invited to have dinner with her old colleagues. The victim got inebriated, and the suspect took her to a motel, where he allegedly raped her. The victim called the police after she went home.           Kim said the Seoul Metropolitan Government transferred the suspect to a different team soon after the incident. Government officials are normally suspended from their posts after rape accusations are made against them, said Kim.            On April 22, the victim sent a text message to Seoul’s personnel officer, who was in charge of the city's human resources, asking for harsher internal punishment against the suspect, but the Seoul Metropolitan Government didn't do anything, Kim said. The victim then leaked her allegation to a local media outlet, which published a story on April 23.            A day later, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced in a statement that an alleged rape occurred and that it suspended the alleged perpetrator upon hearing from police that an investigation had officially been launched that day. The city government also apologized to the victim for not acting quicker.           To this day, the suspect remains a city government official.             Police referred the case to prosecutors in early June with a recommendation to indict the suspect, and a probe has been ongoing ever since.           BY PYUN GWANG-HYUN, LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
485,DP rep. reveals name of whistle-blower in Choo's son's case,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae arrives at the government complex in central Seoul on Friday to attend a cabinet meeting hosted by the prime minister. [YONHAP]               In the latest volley between ruling and opposition lawmakers over Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae's alleged abuse of power, ruling Democratic Party (DP) Rep. Hwang Hee revealed Saturday on Facebook the full name of the whistle-blower who accused Choo’s son of getting preferential treatment during his military service.           “It will be too soon to make conclusions whilst the investigation into the case is ongoing [...] but I see a need to commence a probe on Sergeant Hyun, whose whistleblowing has been the trigger of all this,” Hwang wrote on his Facebook account on Saturday. “Judging by what Hyun has said so far, one may think that he might not be acting alone. We need to find out if there were political forces behind his whistleblowing.”           Hwang used the full name of the former sergeant several times in his post, but deleted it a few hours after receiving hundreds of responses, many criticizing him for revealing the sergeant’s full name. Hwang replaced the full name mentions with “Sergeant Hyun.”           “[Hwang] revealed the full name of the young former sergeant [...] in clear violation of the Protection of Public Interest Reporters Act,” wrote opposition People Power Party (PPP) Rep. Park Dae-chul on Facebook on Saturday.             Article 12 of the act stipulates that “No person shall inform another person of the personal information about a whistleblower [...] or any fact from which one can readily infer that he/she is a whistleblower.”             Former members of the DP also expressed alarm over Hwang’s decision to reveal the name of the whistle-blower. Protection of whistle-blowers has been one of the key promises of the Moon Jae-in administration.           “A lawmaker should always remember that they represent the people first, regardless of their political leanings and which party they are associated with,” wrote former DP lawmaker Geum Tae-seop on Facebook on Saturday. “No circumstance therefore validates a lawmaker to publicly blame an individual [...] let alone insinuate that the individual acted with criminal intentions.”           Hwang apologized on Sunday.           “I apologize for causing trouble with my posting,” Hwang wrote on Facebook on Sunday afternoon. “I didn’t mean to pinpoint Hyun, I meant to emphasize that there may be a force behind him [...] It was not my intention to make Hyun appear like a criminal. I am sorry to the public and Hyun.”           Prosecutors have been probing Choo’s son since January, when opposition lawmakers filed a criminal complaint. The allegation was first brought to light during Choo’s confirmation hearing as justice minister at the National Assembly in December, when a lawmaker cited Hyun’s accusations.           Choo’s son, whose surname is Seo, served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018.             Opposition PPP lawmakers, Hyun, and other whistle-blowers have alleged that Seo was let off the hook when he went AWOL in June 2017, taking twice-extended medical leave for knee surgery.           They claimed Seo broke rules in the process of obtaining his leave by calling his base to extend his leave rather than obtaining an additional permission from a military hospital. Anonymous whistle-blowers also claimed to media outlets that Choo, at the time chairwoman of the DP, or one of her aides called the military to ask for the extension.           Both Choo and her son have denied the allegations.           Choo in her Facebook account on Sunday issued an apology to the public over the scandal.           “I would like to apologize to the public for burdening them with additional concerns regarding my son’s military service, when they already have enough to worry about due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Choo wrote. “I remained reticent until now so as to not influence the ongoing prosecution probe into the matter.”           Choo in her post provided her account of her son’s controversial knee surgery.           “My son received surgery on his left knee before his military service,” Choo wrote. “He then received another surgery to his right knee during his service. He took a medical leave for that. The hospital said he needed at least three months of rest, but he went back into service within a month of his surgery. He finished his service. That is all there is to it. I don’t think that people can try to become ill on purpose while being in military service [...] I will continue to wait upon the results of the prosecution probe, which will determine the truth about the matter.”           As the probe has stretched into months, whistle-blowers in addition to Hyun have stepped forward, in some cases revealing their own names.           Retired Col. Lee Chul-won, former commander of the Army’s unit responsible for managing the Katusa program, became the first witness to publicly back allegations that military officials were pressured to give preferential treatment to Seo on Friday.           “When Seo was in boot camp, one of the staff officers reported to me that a request was made from outside to assign Seo to the Yongsan garrison,” Col. Lee said in a written statement Friday. “The staff officer rejected the request and explained the process of how Katusa soldiers were assigned to bases. [...] After receiving this report, I stressed to my staff officers that they must never accept any improper requests and warned them about various consequences.”             According to Col. Lee, the military also faced pressure to select Seo as one of interpreters for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.           BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         관련기사Retired colonel backs allegations of pressure campaign to give Choo's son special treatmentDocuments say justice minister, husband intervenedFormer sergeant willing to testify that Choo sought favor for sonScandal over justice minister's son keeps snowballingPPP demands special prosecutor to probe allegations against ChooCriminal complaints against justice minister allege favors for AWOL sonChoo's son probed over alleged special treatment in military Alleged special favor for Choo’s son revealed"
486,[Heroes from afar] Thailand’s ‘Little Tigers’ fought bravely in Korea,"

     Rommanee Kananurak, ambassador of Thailand to Korea, speaks with the Korea JoongAng Daily on Sept. 7. [PARK SANG-MOON]   ━   Country was the first in Asia to send troops and stayed until ‘72                 They were fierce, relentless, unforgiving. The Americans called them the “Little Tigers.”           “From Nov. 1 to 11 in 1952, the 1st Battalion of the 21st Thai Regiment attached to the U.S. forces fought off waves of enemy attacks in the sub-freezing temperatures in the mountains near Cheorwon, located above the 38th parallel line,” Rommanee Kananurak, ambassador of Thailand to Korea, told the Korea JoongAng Daily on Sept. 7.           But the weather wasn't the most imposing hurdle during the battle, which took place at Pork Chop Hill from Oct. 31 to Nov. 11, 1952.           “Thai forces fought off three waves of enemy attacks despite being outnumbered by seven to one,” Kananurak said. “Though the Thai forces were supported by the UN’s artillery and mechanized forces, the fight was so intense that the Thai forces had to engage in close-quarters combat.”           The Thais emerged victorious. The Chinese and North Korean forces suffered 322 deaths and more than 1,000 wounded, while the Thais recorded 23 deaths and 76 wounded, according to Thailand's military records.           Recognizing the Thai battalion’s valor, General James A. Van Fleet, commander of the 8th U.S. Army at the time, awarded one Legion of Merit, 12 Silver Stars and 26 Bronze Star Medals to the soldiers in the battalion, and christened them the “Little Tigers.”           Thailand was the first Asian nation to deploy troops to the Korean War (1950-1953), with the first of their forces arriving in November 1950. Over the course of the war, Thailand would send 6,326 soldiers, air force fighters and navy officers to Korea, according to the Korean Defense Ministry.           Lt. Col. Banjop Tonuan, 94, was one of the first ones to arrive.           “I was a corporal with the 2nd Squad Leader, 2nd Platoon, 3rd Company [of the Thai forces],” Lt. Col. Tonuan said on Aug. 31, in response to emailed questions from the Korea JoongAng Daily. “I was one of the troops in the first rotation to fight in this war, serving a year and a half in Korea from 1950 to 1951.”           Just 25 years old at the time, Lt. Col. Tonuan saw a broad swath of the Korean Peninsula during his deployment. One of his missions in late 1950 involved operations in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.               Lt. Col. Banjop Tonuan during his service as a corporal of the Thai forces during the Korean War (1950-1953). He was 25 years old when he came to Korea in 1950. [BANJOP TONUAN]         “My unit and I were on the train from Daegu to Pyongyang for 10 days [in November 1950],” he said. “When we arrived at Pyongyang, we had the advantage, until North Korea was supported by China and we were forced to retreat.”           The United Nations forces had taken Pyongyang on Oct. 19, 1950. But they were forced to beat a retreat by early December, after as many as 300,000 Chinese forces were estimated to have flooded into North Korea, pushing the UN forces out of the city.             “I was one of 10 soldiers who was assigned to station at the Ordnance Ammunition Depot and destroy all ammunition and supplies stockpiles, when Chinese forces were coming close to Pyongyang,” Lt. Col. Tonuan recalled. “I was the one who ignited the explosion. There was a huge explosion, which was extremely loud and devastated the areas. After that, we headed back to South Korea.”           In one battle after another, the soldiers got further acquainted with Korea's terrain and weather, but the atrocities of the war never became easier to bear, Lt. Col. Tonuan recalled.           “My worst memory during the war was the result of napalm bombs that were dropped by U.S. Air Forces,” he said. “After a napalm strike, I was assigned to patrol the area of impact and found nothing but ash, ruins and burnt lifeless bodies of Koreans all over the place.”            For some Thai veterans, the Korean War was their first combat experience.            Col. Samran Wongkhunti remembers the day he was sent to Korea as an 18-year-old private first class, on Oct. 22, 1950.           “At that time, I had just graduated from the Army’s non-commissioned officer school and had not been aware of the serious situation occurring in the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. ""But with the intention to gain experience in the military service and an opportunity to travel abroad, I immediately volunteered to join the war.”              Col. Samran Wongkhunti during his service in the Korean War (1950-1953). Col. Wongkhunti served in Korea at the age of 18, from October 1950 to October 1951. [SAMRAN WONGKHUNTI]         Finding himself in an unfamiliar environment, many things were a first for Col. Wongkhunti. After all these years, the shock from the first attack remains clearly etched in his memory.           “My unit was attacked and hit with shrapnel from a mortar round while on patrol,” he said. “The company communications chief was killed, the commander and some soldiers were severely injured by the bomb blast. It was a real war experience that I would never forget.”           Throughout the conflict, the Thai forces lost 128 soldiers. Another 318 were wounded and five went missing, according to Thai National Memorial.            Like all the other nations who volunteered troops to defend Korea, Thailand had no legal obligation to risk its soldiers' lives and come to Korea's aid at the outbreak of the war. Yet that was how they viewed the call for aid from the UN, Kananurak said.           “Even though the UN [Security Council] Resolution 84 was not a legal obligation and merely a recommendation to the UN member states, Thailand referred to the UN [Security Council] resolution as a legal [obligation] under Thai constitutional law to participate in the Korean War as part of an international cooperation to preserving international justice and peace in the world,” the ambassador said. “This decision demonstrated Thailand’s political commitment as a member of the UN to safeguard peace, security and the sovereignty of the Republic of Korea, according to the principles of the United Nations. “           The Thai forces would be among the last to depart Korea after the war, maintaining at least one company-sized combat unit in Korea from July 1955 to July 1972, with 17 rotations. Counting all those who had served in the war and into 1972, a total of 11,776 Thai served in Korea, according to Thai National Memorial.           That period of deployment was long enough to even span multiple generations, in at least one case.           “Gen. Boriboon Chulacharitta [who was then a colonel] was the commander of the 1st Battalion of the 21st Thai Regiment during the Korean War,” said Kananurak. “Later, Gen. Euaamsak Chulacharitta, Gen. Boriboon Chulacharitta’s son, [who was then a major,] was stationed in the Republic of Korea in the 1970s and oversaw the departure of [the last] Thai combat unit from the Republic of Korea in 1972.”           Since 1972, Thailand has contributed six soldiers to the UN Command honor guards with a military attaché as their commanding officer.           The friendship forged between Thailand and Korea during the war laid the foundation for their official diplomatic ties, established in 1958. The two nations upgraded their bilateral ties to a strategic partnership in 2012.           “This achievement was the cornerstone of the cordial ties of the diplomatic relationship between Thailand and the Republic of Korea,” the ambassador said. “Thai veterans continue to be the inspiration for the new generations to promote long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the Korean Peninsula and the world.”           Some of those veterans have had the opportunity to return and see the country for which they once fought in a different light.              Col. Wongkhunti, 88, in a photo taken recently. [SAMRAN WONGKHUNTI]         “I returned to Korea in 1987,” said Col. Wongkhunti. “It was unbelievable that the Republic of Korea has become a developed country after the war.”           In Lt. Col. Tonuan’s memories, Koreans had kept a very simple lifestyle.           “During the war, I barely communicated with Koreans. I just waved my hands to greet them,” he said. “They were living in poor conditions, with nothing to consume but rice and Kimchi. In my experience, Koreans were utterly patient.”           Lt. Col. Tonuan had not been able to return to the country since its war-ravaged days, but he stayed abreast of the changes in Korea after the Thai troops left.           “I was really impressed with the rapid development of the Republic of Korea, despite the country suffering a significant loss after the war,” he said. “Koreans [showed] a great potential to rebuild their lives and their beloved nation.”              Lt. Col. Tonuan, 94, in a photo taken recently. [BANJOP TONUAN]         As the years pass by, so do memories of the war. But the 88-year-old Col. Wongkhunti says some things will remain unchanged.           “I [can no longer] remember the exact battles that I took part in, but it was my honor to be a part of the most important war in human history,” he said.                      Flag of Thailand  Thailand          Thailand deployed 6,326 soldiers, air force fighters and navy officers to serve in the Korean War (1950-1953), according to the records at the Korean Ministry of National Defense. It was the first Asian nation to deploy troops to the war.             Throughout the conflict, the Thai forces lost 128 soldiers. Another 318 were wounded and five went missing, according to Thai National Memorial.             With the first of the troops arriving in November 1950, the Thai forces would be among the last to depart Korea after the war, maintaining at least one company-sized combat unit in Korea from July 1955 to July 1972, with 17 rotations.

487,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] 'Made in Korea' becomes a must as supply chains collapse,"

     [BYUN JU-YEON]                                As the coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy and manufacturing hubs like China went into lockdown, the extent to which Korea relies on foreign suppliers very quickly became clear.           The shutdown of factories abroad triggered shortages of parts for major manufacturers in Korea, pushing companies like Hyundai Motor to suspend factory operations back in February.           That production stopping on the other side of the world could so quickly bring Korean manufacturers to their knees exposed just how important localizing suppliers is. Producing essential parts and materials at home was a hot-button political issue even before Covid-19 arrived, after Japan imposed restrictions on exports to Korea of three key materials last year.               Workers at a Daeyang Electric production line in Incheon manage the production automotive pressure sensor on Aug. 20. [JEON TAE-GYU]  Seeking self sufficiency          On Aug. 20, this reporter visited the Daeyang Electric factory in Incheon, where chips, springs and other parts are assembled to produce automotive pressure sensors.           Asked if the company has been suffering with its supply chain during the pandemic, Noh Sang-soo, managing director at Daeyang’s sensor division, was surprisingly blase.           “Not at all, we produce all the important parts like chips in this factory,"" said Noh. ""So it was not that difficult to produce the sensors, even at the peak of the pandemic.”           Daeyang is the first and only Korean company to manufacture the pressure sensors used for car braking systems, primarily using its own technology. That makes Daeyang an outlier in Korean manufacturing — a self-sufficient company unaffected by global supply chains.           The government is investing trillions of won into creating a lot more Daeyangs.            The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced a suite of supportive measures in July aimed at incentivizing local companies to make materials, parts and equipment in Korea.           The proposal pledges up to 7 trillion won ($5.9 billion) through 2022 to implementing the measures, ranging from bank loan subsidies to establishing an industrial cluster and exempting the fees needed for industrial standard certification.           The government is also advocating “reshoring” to encourage companies with production sites overseas to bring the facilities back to Korea, an initiative that comes with a 1.5-trillion-won commitment through 2025.           Government agencies are identifying specific product segments that urgently need support and nurturing well-performing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have a proven track record of localizing parts and materials.           The government allocated 1.56 trillion won of its annual budget to the ministry for next year, up 21 percent from the previous year.               Targeted approach          A large part of the subsidies and resources will prioritize 100 strategically important parts and materials that are currently heavily dependent on foreign supplies.           These items include hydrofluoric acid and other materials used in manufacturing automotive sensors, rechargeable batteries and optical lens.           The Industry Ministry said in July that it will extend the list to more than 300 items to include future-proof sectors such as biopharmaceuticals and robotics.           The government agencies are on track to select start-ups and well-performing SMEs — whose business focus and capacity is aligned with the specified materials — for an extensive package of funding and support over the next five years.           “We thought it is more efficient to foster companies with a track record of being successful in producing important parts and materials, instead of nurturing early-stage companies,” said a government official from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups who led the selection process.           Those companies are entitled to receive funding for research and development, expedited certification procedure, loans with favorable interest rates and an advantageous status when competing for state-run projects.              SEC CEO Kim Jong-hyun speaks at the company's headquarters in Suwon, Gyeonggi, on Aug. 26. [JEON TAE-GYU]             Small but competitive          The government thinks the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises is critical in moving important supply chains back home and covering a wide range of parts and materials.           Indeed, SMEs, including micro-businesses and self-employed people, account for 99.9 percent of all registered businesses in Korea, at 3.5 million, with a workforce that takes up 82.2 percent, or 14 million people.           Daeyang Electric benefited from the state-run support package after it started producing its automotive pressure sensor module, a key part to measure pressure and translate it into an electrical signal, in 2014.           Before Daeyang Electric entered the market, U.S. supplier Sensata Technologies dominated the Korean market.           As a late starter, the Korean company tried to develop its competitive edge with low pricing and better repair services for corporate clients.           “It was critical to obtain the core technology behind the component to enhance quality and lower the price,” said Noh. “After the successful mass production in 2014, we now supply our pressure sensor to Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors through partner Mando.”           The company plans to diversify its product lineup by producing electronic stability control systems for advanced mobility solutions, including hydrogen cars and electric vehicles (EVs).           X-ray equipment manufacturer SEC is another company to benefit from the government scheme, and it is also looking to expand its offering to different industries.           “The possible uses of X-ray inspection systems are countless,” said CEO Kim Jong-hyun during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Suwon, Gyeonggi.           The X-ray inspection systems are designed to scan finished products in order to detect micro-scale defects of electronic parts. SEC’s X-ray equipment is currently used in the final manufacturing stage for semiconductors and smartphone batteries.           “We will go on to supply key components tailored for the health care field, which is one of the most lucrative industries with a high barrier to entry, and three-dimensional automated X-ray inspection for EV batteries,” Kim said.           The government is focusing on fostering suppliers for semiconductor-related parts and equipment, given that Korea is home to leading chipmakers like Samsung Electronics and SK hynix.           ATI developed its own technology to produce an inspection system for semiconductor wafers.            “The business was dominated by the United States and Israel, but we localized the core technology that once depended on overseas suppliers,” said Jang Sung-min, head of public relations division at ATI.           The Incheon-based company, also benefiting from the government scheme, has Samsung, SK hynix and Micron as its clients.           The government hopes to strengthen competitiveness in new business areas such as robotics.           In line with that aim, RS Automation made it on the list of beneficiaries as its business is focused on robotic motion control and drive systems.           Motion control refers to the software component of a robotic system that determines how a robot should move to carry out different tasks.           “The robot motion control and drive business will play a central role in establishing smart factories and developing robots,” the company said in a statement. “Some of RS Automation’s technologies managed to pull off a comparable level of performance to top-tier products in Japan.""           To ensure a stabilized supply system in the long run, those companies should grow, according to Kim In-chul, a researcher from the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.           “Korea needs to enter the new sectors impacted by the supply chain disruption worldwide. […] In the longer term, after the coronavirus pandemic, there needs to be measures that could help SMEs increase exports through a global value chain.”               Where it all began          This push to localize isn't new territory. The trade spat with Japan had already exposed Korea’s vulnerable lack of self-sufficiency before the coronavirus pandemic.            Japan’s decision last year to remove Korea from its “white list” of trusted trade partners stems from political tensions surrounding forced labor compensation.           The three materials that Japan curbed exports on — photoresists, hydrogen fluoride gas and fluorinated polyimide — are all critical substances in either the semiconductor or display production process.           Korea's self-sufficiency rate for parts, materials and equipment in general was stuck in the mid-60 percent range from 2011 to 2017, according to the Korea Association of Machinery Industry.           Looking at the industries affected by Japan's measures, semiconductor showed the lowest rate at 27 percent, according to a report released by Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade in 2018.           “There are 400 to 600 steps in the overall manufacturing process of semiconductors that require hundreds of materials and equipment, Korea’s self-sufficiency rate is merely 27 percent due to its reliance on stable supply chain abroad,” the Industry Ministry assessed in its report last September.           Display had the second lowest self-sufficiency rate, at 45 percent.           When the coronavirus pandemic reached Korea in February, a lot more industries were quickly affected.             As most production lines in China came to a standstill, Korea’s manufacturers whose parts are produced in the neighboring country were put on high alert.           One auto part that was immediately at risk was the wiring harness, a bundle of electric wires inside a vehicle. Hyundai Motor Group has three suppliers for wiring harnesses, all headquartered in Korea, but they all have production bases in China.           The matter was eventually resolved with the automobile company switching to wiring harnesses sourced from domestic and Southeast Asian factories, but the risks it exposed cast doubts over the fragility of global value chains and the international fragmentation of production.           “Multiple countries’ economies have become tightly interconnected through global value chains, sometimes converting noneconomic risks into ones that affect the economy,” said Kim from the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade.            “The coronavirus pandemic is a good example of the phenomenon since the virus, which is a noneconomic risk, paralyzed the global supply chain and drove down consumer sentiment,” Kim said in a report released in April.               A quick fix          In this high-stakes situation, major Korean companies played an integral role in addressing the lack of supplies.           Except for photoresists for extreme ultraviolet lithography, Korean companies were able to build up their own technology to replace the Japanese supply for two restricted items — hydrogen fluoride gas and fluorinated polyimide.           SK Materials announced in June that it succeeded in localizing hydrogen fluoride gas, a key material that was 100 percent imported.           Hydrogen fluoride gas, also known as etching gas, is used in gas or liquid form to clean surfaces or etch patterns on semiconductors.           Kolon Industries started mass-producing fluorinated polyimide after establishing manufacturing facilities in Gumi, North Gyeongsang.           “The factory started producing the polyimide last May, and the move was not directly related to Japan’s move,” said a spokesperson at Kolon Industries.           SK Chemical, a 41-percent subsidiary of SK Holdings, has been carrying out tests in Jincheon, North Chungcheong, to supply fluorinated polyimide.           Soulbrain and RAM Technology have successfully mass-produced hydrogen fluoride liquid by increasing production after Japan’s trade restrictions went into effect last year.           Photoresists, which are used to form circuit patterns on chips, were 92 percent produced in Japan. Although no domestic company has been able to produce the material, import sources have been diversified to include Belgium and Germany.           SK Materials is also planning to finish building its factories for argon fluoride by next year, to begin producing the substance in 2022.           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "
488,Number of zombie companies in Korea is growing,"

             Nearly a fifth of Korean companies couldn’t cover interest payments on their loans with operating profits from 2017 to 2019, according to a local study.             According to a study conducted by the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), a lobbying group for big businesses, 17.9 percent of Korean companies with more than 50 billion won ($42 million) in assets failed to generate enough operating profit to cover their loan interest, making them “zombie companies” — companies that make enough to keep going but not enough to invest in future growth.             Korea’s ratio of such companies was the fifth largest among 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The OECD average for zombie companies was 12.4 percent, according to the FKI.             By industry, companies in the services sector struggled most. Thirty-eight percent of them were identified as “zombie companies” in the FKI study, which was far higher than the OECD average for companies in services, which was 10.1 percent. Turkey was the only country among 24 OECD countries that had a higher ratio than Korea’s at 40 percent.            “The proportion of zombie companies in services is likely to get even higher considering Covid-19’s impact on leisure, tourism and hotel businesses,” the FKI report said.             Next on the list were real estate and transport services like trucking and freight businesses — 30.4 percent and 24.3 percent of companies in these industries were failing to cover interest payments with operating profit. Food and beverage companies were doing much better — only 4.7 percent of such companies were “zombies.”           Canada, Greece, the United States and Spain ranked above Korea with higher proportions, with the top three surpassing 20 percent.             However, the FKI pointed out that Korea’s figures were deteriorating. Korea’s ratio of zombie companies jumped from 15.4 percent in 2017 to 17.9 percent in 2019. During the same period, the United States’ figure rose by 1.2 percentage points while Canada, Spain and Greece saw figures decline by 3.2 to 5.1 percentage points.             Korea’s 2017-to-2019 increase of 2.5 percentage points was the sixth-largest among 24 OECD countries, according to FKI's study.           A report in April from the Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI) had an even grimmer analysis: the number of listed zombie companies rose 21.6 percent on year to 90 in 2019, it said. This was the second largest increase behind Japan.             “The stakes are high that zombie companies will increase in the near future due to the new coronavirus. This will put a huge burden on the country’s economy,” said Yoo Hwan-ik, FKI’s head economist for corporate policy. “We need to ease regulations and establish a business environment where these companies can get back on their feet on their own.”           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]         "
489,[SHORTCUT] Big Hit Entertainment and BTS — what's all the fuss about?,"

     BTS performs on U.S. broadcaster NBC's Today Show. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]  Why is BTS suddenly a finance story?      You've probably heard of K-pop superstars BTS, the seven-member boy band that has taken over the world, and recently the Billboard Hot 100 chart, by storm. What you may not know is that BTS's agency Big Hit Entertainment is currently preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) in October. That means that it will be possible for people to buy and sell shares of the company behind BTS, and that is bound to be big business.       Who are BTS?          BTS is a seven-member boy band that debuted in 2013 with the album called 2 Cool 4 Skool, which sold 20,000 units. Their popularity increased with their first full-length album “Dark & Wild,” which sold 100,000 units, and the mini album “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 1,” which sold 200,000 units.            It wasn't until 2015 that BTS finally saw serious recognition on Korean music programs with “I Need U,” a track from its third mini album. The group became increasingly popular overseas, and in 2018 it topped the Billboard 200 chart, the first-ever Asian artist to do so. The band topped the chart with its next three albums as well. In September this year, it made history once again, becoming the first K-pop artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart with its latest track Dynamite.           What is Big Hit Entertainment?          Big Hit Entertainment is a music label founded in 2005 by former JYP producer Bang Si-hyuk. Bang is currently the chairman and CEO of the company. The agency stayed rather low-key in Korea’s music scene with its focus on fostering ballad artists such as K.Will, Lim Jeong-hee and 8eight.            The company’s biggest shareholder is Bang, with a 43.44 percent stake holding 12.4 million shares. His stake dropped from 45.12 percent at the beginning of the year when the company issued new shares for free, raising the total by 1,500 percent and distributing some of the newly-created shares to its own artists. Korean game company Netmarble owns 24.87 percent of the company, followed by a number of private equity companies.            Big Hit Entertainment in the first half generated 294 billion won ($247.7 million) in sales and 49.7 billion won in operating profit. The operating profit surpassed the combined total of the three big entertainment agencies in Korea, with JYP posting 22.5 billion won, SM 14.8 billion won and YG Entertainment minus 300 million won.               What exactly is an IPO, and why is it so important?          An IPO is the process that sees a private company become a public company by allowing ordinary investors to buy newly issued shares. It can be a huge opportunity for a company to secure the liquidity it needs for its business.            Big Hit said it will use the newly raised capital to pay off its debts, expand its domestic and global business and invest in new facilities. In terms of debt, the company borrowed 200 billion won from the Korea Development Bank when acquiring Pledis Entertainment earlier this year.            It has plans to expand its business by acquiring music labels in and outside Korea, especially with a focus on the United States and Japan. The agency also has plans to foster local artists in different countries, rather than just producing albums targeted at foreign audiences. Big Hit is willing to invest 405 billion won on expansion through 2022.            In terms of new facilities, it will move into a new headquarters in Yongsan District, central Seoul, by the first half of 2021, which will include not only its studios, but also cultural facilities.            But an IPO isn't just a financial handout. In return for the liquidity, a public company has significantly more responsibility and obligations. It is obliged to disclose its financial and accounting information as well as major business issues for its investors. Stock price fluctuations can also influence the management of the company.           For investors, Big Hit's IPO is an opportunity to buy a stake of the company which can then be traded on the market. It's an investment, and stockholders might choose to buy and sell their stake quickly, looking for a quick buck, or hold on to it in the hope of making more money down the line.        Bang Si-hyuk, chairman and CEO of Big Hit Entertainment briefs about the company business back in February in Seoul. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]                   Why is there so much excitement for the Big Hit IPO?          Firstly, the enthusiasm comes from the global popularity of BTS and their prospected potential in the future. But aside from that obvious factor, there are a few other elements to the excitement shown for Big Hit’s IPO.            The bullish market and other recent major IPOs are one of those factors. With the ultra-low interest rate and government curb on property investment, people in Korea are on the hunt for investment opportunities, as shown in the bullish market in Korea in recent months upheld by retail investors despite a heavy sell-off by foreigners.            Two recent IPOs — SK Biopharmaceuticals and Kakao Games — also showed retail investors that investing in an IPO is a guaranteed success.            SK Biopharmaceuticals, which had an offering price per share of 49,000 won, closed its first day of trading at 127,000 won, hitting the 160 percent daily spike limit on newly offered shares. Its price went up to as high as 217,000 won and is now being traded at 170,000 won.            The situation was exactly the same for Kakao Games. A record 58.5 trillion won was deposited by people hoping to get a stake in the company. After only a fraction of those potential investors were successful, analysts expect the 58.4 trillion won returned to unsuccessful bidders to be pumped straight into Big Hit’s IPO.               What industrial impact will it have?          The Big Hit IPO will have a trickle-down effect on Korea’s entertainment industry.            Ever since Big Hit filed its securities registration statement with the Financial Services Commission on Sept. 2, JYP Entertainment’s stock price rose from 37,000 won to 41,400 won as of Sept. 10. YG Entertainment’s also rose from 49,000 won to 58,700 won during the same period, and SM’s rose from 37,300 to 37,950 won.            Together with Big Hit Entertainment, which will value at a maximum 4.8 trillion won, Korea’s music industry will potentially be worth more than 8 trillion won by market capitalization. Some analysts predict the ultimate industrial rival of Big Hit will include tech companies such as Naver and Kakao, because Big Hit has recently delved into the platform business as well. Last year, it launched an online platform called Weverse, where Big Hit artists and their fans can communicate, and fans can watch concerts live.               What would the value of Bang and the BTS members' shares be?          According to the regulatory filing, Bang holds 12.3 million shares and distributed some 478,695 shares equally between the seven BTS members last month.           If the offered price is set at 135,000 won for the IPO, Bang’s shares will be worth 1.6 trillion won. If the share price records the maximum 160 percent daily hike limit on the first trading day, his stake nears 4.3 trillion won, immediately making him the fifth richest person in Korea in terms of stock holdings, after Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Motor Group.            Each BTS member holds 68,385 shares, which will be worth 9.2 billion won at the 135,000-won share price. If the stock price does hit the maximum daily hike, each member will have 24 billion won.               What are the risks to betting big on the Big Hit IPO?          Despite the enthusiasm, there are things to think about before making an investment.            Big Hit's regulatory filing states that 97.4 percent of the company’s sales last year came from BTS, followed by 87.7 percent in the first half of this year. BTS’s activities are destined to be curtailed when its members, all of whom were born between 1992 and 1997, leave for two years to serve their mandatory military service.            It remains to be seen if the company will be able to fill up the BTS vacancy with its current lineup. Big Hit said Jin, the oldest member of BTS born in 1992, will be able to delay his conscription until the end of 2021 at the latest. In fact, Big Hit's price-to-earning ratio (P/E ratio), which indicates the valuation of the stocks, showed signs of the stock price overheating. Large cap shares normally post a 20 to 30 P/E ratio. In the case of Big Hit, that number is 61.            BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

In a country like Korea where about half the population lives in apartment buildings, it is no surprise to see so many cookie-cutter buildings.           In the past two decades, people's wants and needs for their apartments have changed — in turn leading to changes in newly built complexes, especially, since the arrival of brands from local construction companies.           Raemian is the first brand a construction company put in front in 2000 to start the new era. Since then, many other companies followed suit to create a brand instead of naming its newly built apartment after the company’s name. GS Engineering and Construction unveiled Xi, which it still carries, while Daelim has e-Pyeonhan Sesang, which translates to “comfortable world,” as well as the more luxurious brand Acro. Daewoo Construction has been pushing its Prugio apartment complexes as well as officetels and Hyundai Engineering and Constructionhas The H brand from Hillstate.           Besides the brands, the companies have competed against each other to give their concrete creations a feeling of luxury by using ""castle"" or ""tower"" in their names. For example: Lotte Castle, Brown Stone and Royal Palace.           “With such brands coming out in the market, it has become important for construction companies to create the right image for its brand to make better sales,” said professor Lee Chung-kee of architecture at the University of Seoul.           “The focus is more on what image each brand portrays when it comes to choosing the apartment more so than what features each brands offers inside the apartment complex.”              Ichon Raemian Caelitus pictured in central central Seoul's Yongsan District. [SAMSUNG C&T]                   The updates over time      Up until the 1990s, the layouts of apartment units and what features they came with were very simple. That is simply because, even without any add-ons, units were selling very well whenever new apartment complexes were introduced to the market, said architect Hahn Jong-ruhl, who is also the vice president for the International Union of Architects.           Samsung C&T, which launched the brand Raemian 20 years ago, said people used to see apartments as an asset and as something to own in the early 2000s. Reflecting such a trend, the company started to focus on providing more added value. To make the brand better known, it started making the exteriors of its apartment complexes different with colors and logos to help the Raemian buildings stand out even from afar and give a proud sense of ownership.              The first ever apartment to be named Raemian in Suwon, Gyeonggi. [SAMSUNG C&T]               It has tried to provide “trust” to residents and minimize any inconveniences.           “In 2005, to provide different services to residents, we launched a service brand called ‘Hestia’ to help residents with the maintenance issues they face over time, and to provide them with a chance to learn and share [things with neighbors],” said Samsung C&T’s communications team, adding that it has even offered opportunities to residents to make donations and help others in need.              A management center built to look similar to a cafe in Uiwang, Gyeonggi, in a file photo from 2001. [JOONGANG PHOTO]               It has also collaborated with designers like Andre Kim to research ways to make its residents more satisfied in terms of style while constantly marketing its brand.           Entering the 2010s, people started to also focus more on their quality of life during their search for an apartment. The arrival of Banpo Raemian in Seocho District, southern Seoul, in 2009, has further driven the push for apartment complexes to provide convenient features, on top of the value as an asset. Floorplans of units started to become more varied to better cater to the different needs of potential residents, as well as facilities offered inside the complex.              A communal sauna offered at Banpo Raemian in Seocho District, southern Seoul. [SAMSUNG C&T]               Throughout a decade, Raemian slowly moved more toward introducing new communal facilities, like spas and guest houses, as well as other facilities for residents to take advantage of during their leisure time.            The attention on eco-friendly lifestyles has also pushed the company to add more green energy options to its complexes, such as charging stations for electric cars and solar panels set up on the roof.           After trying to bring more style into its apartment units, now the brand is expanding to make living more convenient than ever before with all kinds of cutting-edge technology related to the internet of things (IoT). With the slogan “Next Raemian Life,” it connects the services it has provided over the past 20 years to online platforms.           The exterior of some buildings are used as artistic facades, while others have lower floors that have been designed to function as shopping streets.            Considering more people worry about clean air with issues regarding ultrafine dust, the buildings have been equipped with features like air filters.            Breakfast and lunch services are possible thanks to a communal restaurant exclusive for residents, alongside a lounging area and a cafe, and some other pet care and health care services for the elderly are also available.           The arrival of virtual reality tools had made it possible for people to view inside their future homes in more convenient ways, which has become especially convenient during the pandemic period.           “As people’s lifestyles at home have started to change with the spread of the coronavirus, we are working on new floor plans and communal options,” said Samsung C&T.              A model home from 2009 with features inspired by the cutting-edge technology at the time. [JOONGANG PHOTO]               The company is considering including balconies where people can dine to feel nature from the comfort of their own homes, as well as having home offices for work and study. Communal spaces will have one-person pools or more private gyms, and glamping sites will be available for residents to spend enjoyable time outdoors, but safely.           “So far, the home has been a place where rest is offered, but now it will become the space where residents can accomplish their life goals,” said the company, adding that people will probably tend to spend more time at home. “The home will be the place where both office work and house chores are done or even educational activities.""           Architect Hahn added that features people enjoy in nature will more gradually be brought into individual homes in apartment complexes.           “Although many have preferred to get rid of any balcony space to make their living room or other rooms bigger, now they will go back to having the balcony once again to grow plants and do activities with children,” said Hahn.           “The layout and functions of units will be updated to cater better to what’s needed at home as the lifestyles of residents change overall over time.”              A cafe overlooking the Han River at Ichon Raemian Caelitus. [SAMSUNG C&T]                   Living in style      The quest is not finished even after you find the apartment of your dreams. Many now find themselves making adjustments, big or small, with an interior designer to make the satisfying exterior match the inside of their homes.            Since the units inside aren’t too different from one another, many add touches to make the space one-of-a-kind. Some simply add furniture that fits their personal taste, while others make bigger adjustments like adding new doors to separate certain spaces.           Decades ago, the final touches were led mostly by what was offered by the construction companies that were building the apartment complexes, according to interior designer Jung Eun-joo. Model houses they set up to introduce certain new apartments were the barometer to check the new trends in home decor, and many often asked to do something similar to what they had seen at such places.           However, nowadays, with lots of images available on Pinterest, Instagram and other social media platforms, residents more boldly pursue their own personal interior style.           “There are about seven to eight styles of a big trend, and within that category, people develop their own micro styles to create something that's solely their own and what they favor,” said Jung.           “What’s commonly known as a living room doesn’t have to always work as a [lounging area], and any room can become a dining room by mixing and matching different things in different spaces.""           For instance, a bedroom still carries the function of where people sleep, but added-on facilities have been changing such as adding walk-in closets which have a washer and dryer right next to them for the ultimate convenience.            Creating a photo zone inside the home is a request that has risen to the surface in the past couple of years as more people want to share photos online.           “Home has been the most important place in people's lives especially over the past six months as people spend more time than before in their homes, and it has become the place where a variety of content is being created,” said Jung, adding that some want a wall to take pictures of their child as they grow while others look for decorative items to share with others online.           “The most important thing to many is to get out of the uniformed design and life that comes with living in apartment units that are all the same.”           BY LEE SUN-MIN   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]   "
491,American installation artist brings the great outdoors inside,"

     Visitor's shadows become part of Jennifer Steinkamp's video installation ’Retinal 1, 2“ (2019). [Leeahn Gallery]         American installation artist Jennifer Steinkamp’s solo exhibition “Souls” offers a place to take a closer look at beautiful natural scenery.           While many people have incorporated technology, like playing a video of a campfire or ocean waves on a projector screen at home to compensate for not being able to travel amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, “Souls” illuminates the beauty of nature by incorporating 3-D computer animation software.            Once visitors enter the dark exhibition hall, they are naturally drawn to a projector screen that stretches into a room-sized environment. The HD video installation offers the detailed and lively movement of a natural object as if it's being viewed under a microscope. As soon as a shadow is cast, one becomes part of the work. By blurring out the boundaries between art and technology through interaction, Steinkamp’s animated installations create a unique virtual reality where viewers can be completely immersed in the digital landscape.               Jennifer Steinkamp's ""Blind Eye 4“ (2019). [Lehmann Maupin Seoul]          Steinkamp has been producing large-scale video installations that deal with trees, flowers, the sky and other organic forms in realistic motions.          “I am fascinated by software’s ability to create ideas we would never conceive of in the natural world,” Steinkamp said.            The exhibition highlights her important position as a leading artist in the field of digital animation and as a pioneer in conducting experiments that fully digitize images, colors, textures and movements.            She transforms an existing space that is as plain as a white wall into artwork by realizing the colors and movements of nature through the reflection of light using 3-D rendering techniques. She first draws the images digitally and then uses software to render her work. With technological advances, she updates her work with more pixels and higher resolution by formatting the original work.               Jennifer Steinkamp's ’Primordial, 1“ (2020). [Lehmann Maupin Seoul]         “Her video installations are dimension variable — she measured the wall dimension of our gallery to design a screen that perfectly fits the wall so that the viewers can completely immerse themselves into the full screen,” one of the host galleries, Lehmann Maupin Seoul, said.           Co-hosted by two galleries in Jongno District, central Seoul, “Souls” introduces six of her video installations, which consist of her new work, “Still-Life 4” (2020), “Judy Crook 12, 14” (2019) and her “Retinal 1, 2” (2019) at Leeahn Gallery and “Blind Eye 4” (2019), “Primordial, 1” (2020) and “Daisy Chain Twist, tall” (2004) at Lehmann Maupin Seoul.               Jennifer Steinkamp's ’Daisy Chain Twist, tall“ (2004). [Lehmann Maupin Seoul]          The title of her representative installation “Judy Crook” series is named after Judy Crook, whom Steinkamp was inspired by when she was a student at the Art Center College of Design and Pasadena City College. Through “Judy Crook 12” and “Judy Crook 14” (2019), viewers can experience the four seasons that a typical tree goes through in just a few minutes.              Jennifer Steinkamp's ""Judy Crook 12“ (2019). [Leeahn Gallery]          “Steinkamp looks to nature by simulating changes in nature with a unique infinite cycle,” Leeahn Gallery said.            In an endless cycle, flowers bloom in spring, green leaves sprout in summer, leaves turn red in autumn and trees shed their leaves in winter. The continuously moving images of the tree are rendered realistically, which allow visitors to feel the ideals of infinite life.                Jennifer Steinkamp's ""Judy Crook 14“ (2019). [Leeahn Gallery]          Inspired by the vanitas still life paintings of Flemish artists in the 17th century, which had a message of “Vanitas vanitatum, omnia vanitas” — meaning earthly life is ultimately empty and meaningless — “Still-Life 4” is a reinterpretation of still life paintings that expresses timelessness in the earthly life. The graphics of fruits, flowers and plants that constantly move provide plenty of vitality that show the continuous nature of all things.              Jennifer Steinkamp's ’Still-Life 4“ (2020).

492,Erwin Olaf's latest exhibition imagines the ultimate April Fool's prank,"

     ""April Fool 2020 9:45am"" by Erwin Olaf [K.O.N.G GALLERY]               Haven’t you thought at some point, that you wish all of this was just an April Fool’s prank? That the coronavirus wasn’t real and that the reality we were living wasn’t actually real? Well, you’re not alone in that thought.           Photographer Erwin Olaf, well known for his witty yet melancholic work, started a new series this year titled “April Fool 2020” portraying his — and everyone else’s — wish that Covid-19 was just an April Fool’s prank. K.O.N.G Gallery, located in central Seoul, has invited Olaf as the second artist to take part in a series of its Covid-19 exhibitions that started in May with Jen Pak’s solo exhibition.           “The visual narrative of ‘April Fool 2020’ gives shape to the emotions and images that paralyzed me after we all suddenly woke up in the surreal nightmare of this pandemic,” Olaf said. “Fear and powerlessness have dominated me for a few weeks now; I feel like an insignificant extra in some morbid film, the conclusion of which is entirely unknown. The plane in which we are all sitting has lost its engines — the benevolent silence is only a harbinger for what is still to come.”           In his new series, Olaf features himself as the only subject within the photograph with his face painted in white, to symbolize “the joker where the house of cards is collapsing” according to the artist. He stands on a deserted street of Amsterdam, inside a mart with empty shelves, alone in his house and looking forlornly out a window, all to express his sense of loss and vanity of everyday things.            The works follow a chronological order. He starts his day at 9:15 a.m. and wanders around until 11:30 a.m. Ten photographs and a 20-minute video are on display.               ""April Fool 2020 9:50am"" by Erwin Olaf [K.O.N.G GALLERY]                  ""April Fool 2020 11:15am"" by Erwin Olaf [K.O.N.G GALLERY]               Olaf began his work as a journalist and turned to photography as a different means to capture reality.            He won the Young European Photographer of the Year award in 1988 with his “Chessmen” series and has been named as one of the most respected photographers of his time. Last year, he was awarded a Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion by the Dutch government. His works, including the latest series, are records of his inner feelings but also portraits of his fellow humans and the world.           “The supermarket shelves, emptied by hoarders, made me realize that for decades I have assumed that everything would always be there, that our dancing on the volcano’s edge would never end,” he said. “Nothing could be further from the truth, and here I stand, my mouth full of teeth.”           Viewers can see the exhibition in 3-D via the gallery’s website. The pieces are also available for purchase.            BY YOON SO-YEON    [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]    "
493,Korea's biggest biennales find safe space online ,"

     A 3-D configuration of the Busan Biennale event taking place in Yeongdo. [BUSAN BIENNALE]               Korea’s biggest art events are taking shelter online after vowing to tough out the Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year, yielding to the sudden outbreak of infections in the greater Seoul area which have called for the toughest measures by the government yet.           The Busan Art Biennale was confident that it could pull off this year's event despite the coronavirus, but opened its event online instead, as well as the Daejeon Biennale, which has also been subject to the same fate. The Korean International Art Fair (KIAF), Korea's biggest art fair, announced its plans to go online for this year's event too.           The Busan Biennale kicked off its event on Sept. 5 under the title of “Words at an Exhibition — an exhibition in ten chapters and five poems.” The unique theme saw literary works created beforehand and artwork and sound to accompany the written works. The biennale had prepared for this scenario where it doesn’t get to open to viewers, and came up with digital content to allow viewers a chance to experiment something new, according to the organizing committee.           This year’s director Jacob Fabricius held an online streaming session on the day of the opening where he introduced all the works while touring around the exhibit halls, while answering questions from some 300 people who tuned in to watch him through YouTube. This was the first time for the biennale’s director to introduce all the works on display, giving art lovers a new experience. Videos, sounds and 3-D configurations of the exhibit halls will be available until Nov. 8 through the event’s official website.              Theresa Reimann-Dubbers's ""Room with a View"" (2020). [DAEJEON BIENNALE]               The Daejeon Biennale also began online on Sept. 8, holding its opening ceremony through YouTube. Its website offers online tours of the artwork as well as interviews of artists from in and outside of Korea that are taking part in the event. A special artificial intelligence (AI) docent program has been developed by KAIST, which allows viewers to download the application to ask questions and get answers on artwork being exhibited.           The event is held under the title “A.I., Sunshine Misses Windows” through Dec. 6, touching on the idea of how humans can use AI as a medium for art. Sixteen teams of artists from six countries — Korea, the United States, Germany, Spain, Italy and Sweden — express their own thoughts on the relationship between humans and AI without a director invited from outside, but guided by the Daejeon Museum of Art. New works by renowned artists such as Hito Steyerl and Theresa Reimann-Dubbers will be revealed for the first time through the event.           Korea’s biggest art fair KIAF also announced that it will go online for the first time for this year’s event since it started in 2002.           “We regret having to hold this event online, after trying our best to present the greatest works from the most prestigious art galleries from around the world amid this worldwide crisis,” said KIAF. “We have been offering an online viewing room as an alternative through our website, and we have decided to fully transform the format to an online one.""           This year, some 140 galleries have taken part and offered 4,000 pieces of work that can be seen online. The viewing room will be revealed to VIPs on Sept. 16 at 3 p.m. and go on view to the public from Sept. 23 at 3 p.m. for a month.

494,The rock band that's about to see a generation of success,"

     Marking the 25th anniversary of its debut, punk rock band Crying Nut recently released a special album. [JANG JIN-YOUNG]               Musicians come and go in the fast-paced music industry with only a few succeeding in engraving their names and music in the heart of listeners. This feat is even harder for musicians from less-preferred genres on home soil such as punk rock.            When five-member punk rock band Crying Nut broke onto the music scene in 1995, the band seemed like misfits in a sea of crooners clad in tidy suits with neatly parted hair.           But the band survived the turbulent history of the music industry from the days of cassette tapes to the MP3 era to the most recent online streaming services.            “On our 20th anniversary [from our debut], I didn’t know it was such an amazing thing to perform as a band for 20 years. Playing music was a matter of course for us, like eating and sleeping. We did our thing and one day we found 20 years had passed in a blink,” said Kim In-soo, who plays accordion and keyboard at Crying Nut.           “After our 20th anniversary, every year felt so long, and I found my health was deteriorating one year after another. On our 25th anniversary, I finally realized that we’re great and amazing in a way because we'd stayed together for this long,” Kim added when he was asked how he feels about the band’s 25th anniversary during a recent interview with the JoongAng Ilbo, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily.           The other four members began to add their thoughts about growing old. Some of them said they find “their hair becoming thinner” or they keep seeing “ads for medicines that are good for hair loss on SNS.”              The best album cover, created by Lee Sang-myun, who plays the guitar at Crying Nut. [DRUG RECORD]               All of the bandmates are friends from childhood who grew up in Ichon-dong in Yongsan District, central Seoul. They went to the same schools all the way from elementary to high school.           Marking the 25th anniversary of its debut, the band wanted to archive the music it has made so far into a single album.           They released the special album on Aug. 24, titled “Crying Nut 25th Anniversary Best Album.”           A total of 16 tracks were included on the album, and an LP version of the album will be released sometime in November.           All the tracks were newly recorded at CJ Azit Tune Up Studio, which is furnished with the latest recording equipment, located in Sinjeong-dong, Mapo District, western Seoul.           “It’s embarrassing to listen to old recordings of us. It feels like I’m reading my old diaries,” said Park Yoon-sik, the main vocalist. “The first album was especially awful. The guitar was not properly tuned and our songs were close to barking, not singing,” added Park with a laugh.           The best-of album includes hits such as “Deep into the Night” (2001) and “Isn’t That Good?” (2007) as well as other tracks that the band members wished to record again.           “In the old days, we were full of anger, therefore we sang with that spirit, but now we have all become benign,” said Lee Sang-hyuk, the drummer.           For the special album, Lee Sang-myun, the guitarist, made a parody of the previous album covers of the band with oil paintings after he had to stop performing last year due to when he fractured his arm.           Along with releasing the special album, Crying Nut plans to hold a concert on Oct. 17 at Sfactory in Seongsu-dong, Seongdong District, eastern Seoul. An exhibition, which chronicles the history of the band, is also scheduled.           The concert and the exhibition were initially planned to take place on Sept. 19 but was postponed due to the sporadic and sudden surge of daily coronavirus cases.           “We prepared a lot for the concert and the exhibition, but safety comes first,” said Han Kyung-rock, the bassist. “We’re also seeking other opportunities in which we could meet our fans online,” he added.           The band held concerts in recent months without an audience due to the pandemic. “We came to realize how much the audience means to us,” said the band in unison.           Park said, “Only when there is an audience we gain energy from them and perform to our best abilities, but it felt like we were singing at the wall.”           When asked the band’s wish for the upcoming 30th anniversary: “I want to keep going without resorting to memories,” said Han.           “They say a generation lasts for 30 years. So my dream is to become a band that goes beyond a generation and sees a whole family come to our concert,” said Park.             BY MIN KYUNG-WON   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Scene from the film ""Nomadland."" Chloe Zhao's ""Nomadland"" won the Golden Lion at the 77th Venice Film Festival. [AP]                Chloe Zhao's ""Nomadland,"" a recession-era road trip drama starring Frances McDormand, won the Golden Lion for best film Saturday at a slimmed-down Venice Film Festival, which was held against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.           Zhao and McDormand appeared by video from the United States to accept the award, given virus-related travel restrictions made reaching the Lido in the Italian lagoon city difficult if not impossible for many Hollywood filmmakers and actors.           ""Thank you so much for letting us come to your festival in this weird, weird world and way!"" McDormand told the masked audience as the Italian marketing team for the film actually accepted the award. ""But we're really glad you let us come! And we'll see you down the road!""           Britain's Vanessa Kirby won best lead actress for ""Pieces of a Woman,"" a harrowing drama about the emotional fallout on a couple after their baby dies during a home birth. Italy's Pierfrancesco Fabino won best lead actor for ""Padrenostro,"" (Our Father), an Italian coming-of-age story that takes place after a terrorist attack in the 1970s.           Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa won the Silver Lion for best director for ""Wife of a Spy,"" while the Silver Lion grand jury prize went to Mexico's Michel Franco for his dystopian drama ""Nuevo Orden.""           The Russian film ""Dear Comrades!"" about a 1960s era massacre in the former Soviet Union, won a special jury prize while Chaitanya Tamhane won best screenplay for ""The Disciple,"" about an Indian man's pursuit to be a classical vocalist.           That the 10-day Venice festival took place at all was something of a miracle, given that northern Italy in late February became ground zero for Europe's coronavivrus outbreak. The Cannes Film Festival was canceled and other big international festivals in Toronto and New York opted to go mostly online.           But after Italy managed to tame its infections with a strict 10-week lockdown, Venice decided to go ahead, albeit under safety protocols that would have previously been unthinkable for a festival that has prided itself on spectacular visuals and glamorous clientele.           Face masks were required indoors and out. Reservations for all were required in advance, with theater capacity set at less than half. The public was barred from the red carpet and paparazzi, who would normally chase after stars in rented boats, were given socially distanced positions on land.           While it's too soon to say if the measures worked, there were no immediate reports of infections among festival-goers and compliance with mask mandates and social distancing appeared to be high.           Movie lovers applauded Venice's effort and the symbolic significance of the world's oldest film festival charting the path forward.           ""It's a moment of rebirth for everyone, for the whole world,"" said Emma Dante, the Italian director of the in-competition film ""The Macaluso Sisters."" ""This festival is really an important moment of encounter, of beginning to dream again and be together again, even with the norms and following all the safety protocols.""           AP           "

[YONHAP]               Most large Korean companies sent employees home to work when the government applied stricter social distancing measures in mid-August.           But workers at small companies — especially in manufacturing — continue to come to work and risk exposure to the coronavirus, according to a survey by the Korea Enterprises Federation (KEF) released on Sunday.           Among 69 of the top 91 companies by annual revenue, 88.4 percent said many of their office workers are working from home.             Nine big state-owned companies were not included in the survey.             The survey was conducted on Sept. 7 and 8.             The survey found that 44.4 percent of the companies adopted systems in which employees took turns working at home.             Some 27 percent of the companies designated certain categories of employees to work at home — such as workers who are pregnant or have underlying health conditions — or accepted applications to work at home.             Only 15 percent made all employees work from home beyond those considered essential to be in the office.            A majority said employees working from home didn’t have a major negative impact on productivity.             Some 46.8 percent said the productivity of employees working from home was 90 percent or higher than normal; 25.5 percent said productivity was 80 to 89 percent; 17 percent said productivity was 70 to 79 percent.             However, 10.6 percent said productivity was low, falling 70 percent or more.             “As there were little differences in productivity when working at home, companies’ acceptance of the work-at-home system seems to be high,” said a KEF official. “However, the companies surveyed are large companies that could manage the productivity of those working at home through various IT programs.”             The survey found that 77.6 percent of the companies made increasing use of IT programs including messenger apps.            Some Korean telecommunication companies have been introducing new programs for working from home.             KT on Sunday sad it signed a cooperation contract with Korean developers Madras Check, SaehaComms and Tilon to develop a “digital works” non-contact work solution.             However, employees of smaller companies continue to face risks on the job.             Workers on production lines can't do their work from home.             “We have never even considered the possibility of working from home,” said an official of an SME parts supplier for Samsung Electronics in Giheung, Gyeonggi who requested anonymity. “We always face risks of being exposed to the coronavirus. The only defense we have is taking precautions.”             However, companies said they are taking precautionary measures such as increasing paid leaves or holidays, adjusting break times and even changing commuting hours to help workers avoid crowds.           Among the 69 companies that participated in the survey, 53.2 percent said they were certain that working from home will likely continue in some form even after the coronavirus pandemic, while 33.9 percent didn't think so.             BY LEE SOO-KI, LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]         "

499,Politicians trade accusations of downplaying wealth in official reports,"

     Rep. Cho Su-jin of the People Power Party (PPP).  [YONHAP]                Ruling and opposition lawmakers are accusing each other of intentionally omitting large amounts of personal wealth when they filed assets reports to the election watchdog before the April general elections.             The finger-pointing started earlier this month, when Rep. Cho Su-jin of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) was criticized for having reported a substantially smaller amount of wealth to the National Election Commission (NEC) before the general elections.             Before the elections in April, Cho filed a report to the NEC that she owned 1.85 billion won ($1.56 million) of wealth as of Dec. 31, 2019. But the assets report by the lawmaker, disclosed on Aug. 28, showed that her wealth was 3 billion won as of May 30, 2020.             Cho worked as a reporter for the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper and Channel A for 20 years. She received the No. 1 spot in the PPP’s proportional candidacy list to start her political career.           Many ruling Democratic Party (DP) members raised a suspicion that she had intentionally omitted 1.1 billion won worth of wealth when she filed the report.             In a Facebook message on Sept. 5, Cho said the omission of some of her wealth was an honest mistake. She said she quit the newspaper on March 5 and had little time to prepare the paperwork by the deadline on March 26. She said she failed to include 500 million won of money she had lent to someone, as well as 600 million won in her severance pay and her husband’s cash deposit.             The DP questioned Cho’s integrity. Rep. Huh Young, spokesman for the DP, said on Sept. 7 that filing a false wealth report is a criminal offense that could cause her to lose her seat.             “During the 18th National Assembly, then-lawmaker Jeong Kuk-kyo [of the DP] had lost his seat for having failed to declare all his wealth,” Huh said. “Who can possibly believe that it was an honest mistake to forget 1.1 billion won?”             In the face of the DP’s attacks, Cho launched a counterattack on Wednesday. She said some DP lawmakers had also omitted some of their assets when they filed reports to the NEC in March.             “I have compared the DP lawmakers’ campaign materials with the latest report on the lawmakers’ wealth,” Cho said. “And I saw multiple omissions.”             She then raised issues against nine DP lawmakers, including Kim Hong-gul, the third son of the late President Kim Dae-jung.              Rep. Kim Hong-gul of the Democratic Party (DP).  [YONHAP]                Rep. Kim, a first-term proportional representative for the DP, said he owns 5.8 billion won worth of assets in March. In the latest report in August, his wealth amounted to 6.77 billion won.           Although Kim owns four homes, including the ownership right to one apartment, Kim only said he owns three properties.       According to Kim, his wife purchased the ownership right to an apartment in Godeok-dong, Gangdong District of eastern Seoul in 2016 and sold it this February. The property right was supposed to be included in Kim’s wealth report, but was omitted.             According to an MBC report on Thursday, Kim’s wife made massive real estate investments from June until December 2016. She purchased an apartment in Ilwon-dong, Gangnam District, in June 2016. She then purchased the property right for the Godeok-dong apartment in October. Two months later, she purchased an apartment in Banpo-dong, Seocho District of southern Seoul.             Real estate experts said she spent at least 1.7 billion won to buy the three properties within six months.           Including the residence of the late President Kim in Donggyo-dong, western Seoul, Rep. Kim was supposed to declare four properties when he filed the wealth reports to the NEC before the elections. But he didn't include the Godeok-dong apartment.             Kim said he does not manage the wealth himself, so he didn’t know that his wife had purchased the ownership right.             Kim also reported to the NEC that his wife owns half of a commercial property in Seodaemun District. She, however, was the sole owner of the property.             As a result, Kim omitted 900 million won worth of wealth when he filed a report to the NEC before the elections.             One of the country’s largest civic groups on Friday demanded that the NEC take legal action against Cho and Kim.             The People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (PSPD) said Friday in a statement that the amounts of omitted wealth are too large to be honest mistakes.             The PSPD said the NEC must file criminal petitions to the prosecution. It also said the National Assembly’s Public Service Ethics Committee must start an investigation to scrutinize the wealth reports of all 300 lawmakers.             “Offering false information of wealth is a serious criminal act because it can influence the voters,” said the PSPD. “And yet, the two lawmakers are giving lame excuses that they were just mistakes.”             The PSPD said Reps. Cho and Kim must apologize to the people and cooperate with investigation. It also said the DP and the PPP are responsible for nominating them without thorough vetting.             The PSPD also criticized the NEC for its failed oversight.           “After it became aware of the cases, it should have started a legal process. How come nothing has been done?” the civic group asked. “The statute of limitations is still alive, so the NEC must bring the cases to the prosecution right now.”                   BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

502,Small business owners say relief measures offer no relief,"

     Owners of coin noraebang, or booth-type singing rooms, in Daejeon stage a protest at the Daejeon Metropolitan City Hall on Thursday. The association of coin noraebang businesses demanded that the government lift the designation of coin noraebang as high-risk facilities and provide solutions for rent payments. [KIM SEONG-TAE]               The news of a fourth supplementary budget, which focuses on supporting small businesses, has not been received well by a large part of its target audience, as small business owners say the focus should be on rent control and boosting demand.           “Our loss from the two weeks of Level 2.5 social distancing exceeds 10 million won. Does the government think that one month’s rent is enough?” said Kim, who owns a seafood restaurant in Gongdeok-dong in Mapo District, western Seoul. “It seems like nothing more than patting itself on the back.”            The government on Thursday announced its decision that of the 7.8-trillion-won ($6.6-billion) supplementary budget, 3.8 trillion won will be used for disaster emergency relief grants for roughly 3.77 million people. Some 3.2 trillion won of that amount will be given as cash grants of up to 2 million won to 2.91 million self-employed businesses.            The social welfare component of the budget, which includes provision for a 20,000-won payment toward smartphone bills for everyone aged 13 or older, has also garnered frustration. For many scrambling to pay the rent, a phone bill discount is not much help.            For the main chunk of the budget, the lack of consideration for different sizes of businesses is a major area of complaint among self-employed business owners.            “Even within the same building, rent varies based on the location and size of the restaurant. It does not make sense that a store that pays more than 10 million won on monthly rent receives the same amount as a small shop that pays 2 million won,” said Kim. “I wish the government would help with rent control.”           Facilities that have been designated as high-risk and banned from opening, such as PC rooms and coin noraebang, or booth-type singing rooms, struggle to cover fixed costs including rent and interest on loans. For a larger PC room in a bustling area, the monthly rent is close to 24 million won.            “If the government lifts the ban, I will return the 2 million won of emergency relief grant,” said Choi Yoon-sik, chair of the Korea Internet PC Culture Association (IPCA). “The ban on PC rooms, which have dividers installed between users, and not on restaurants, makes me think the government is only interested in pleasing the public.”           According to the IPCA, 30 PC rooms are going out of business every day.            “The government has not disclosed the rationale for designating coin noraebang as high-risk facilities,” said Kim Tae-rim, the secretary general of the Korea Coin Musicroom Association. “The association demands that the designation as well as the ban on the operation of coin noraebang is lifted.”           Last week’s data from Korea Credit Data showed that entertainment facilities like noraebang and PC rooms nationwide took just 9 percent of sales compared to the same period last year. For the metropolitan region, they earned only 3 percent of last year’s sales.           “I could no longer make ends meet, so I sold my business after lowering the premium on rent,” said Park, who runs a bar in Yeouido, western Seoul. Two weeks ago, Park put a pause on his business and started a part-time delivery job at Coupang Eats.            In a survey conducted by Alba Cheonguk, a website for part-time job hunters, 59 percent of 234 business owners responded that they have considered closing after the Level 2.5 social distancing started. Twenty six respondents, or 11 percent, actually closed their businesses. Within the high-risk group, which includes 12 types of facilities, the rate was 69 percent.           Based on a survey of associations representing 22 high street businesses, the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) estimated that over the second half of 2020, they will face an average 42 percent on-year drop in net profit. If Level 3 social distancing comes into effect, the amount rises to 52.6 percent.             “During the early months of the year, the demand for photography businesses is usually high from events like the start of school, weddings and other family events, but this year, it’s close to none,” said a spokesperson for The Korean Professional Photographers Association. “Even beyond a severe impact, the industry is decimated. I hope there will be a variety of solutions for small businesses, like allowing transactions for photo shoots via gift vouchers.”           Regarding the government support measures for high street businesses, 42.8 percent said the government should focus on boosting demand and 25 percent responded that it should provide monetary support.            “The high street is hanging on by a thread,” said Yoo Hwan-Ik, director of the FKI’s industry department. “Not only is the immediate financial support for small business owners urgent, but there also needs to be a comprehensive policy for reviving consumer sentiment.”            BY BAE JUNG-WON, LEE SO-AH, KANG KI-HEON   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Asiana Airlines aircraft are parked at Incheon International Airport on Sept. 11. [YONHAP]               Hyundai Development Company’s (HDC) deal with Kumho Industrial to acquire its stake in Asiana Airlines was officially scrapped on Friday, nine months after the two parties signed an agreement in December.          Kumho Industrial notified HDC of the termination of the acquisition deal on Friday after HDC continuously delayed closing the deal and demanded further due diligence of the airline.           On the same day, the cash-strapped airline’s creditor Korea Development Bank (KDB) said Asiana Airlines would receive a 2.4-trillion-won ($2-billion) capital injection from state funds designated to support core industries, including the airline.           “The merger and acquisition deal with the HDC-Mirae Asset Daewoo consortium has been scrapped,” wrote Asiana Airlines President Han Chang-soo in an online message to employees. “Amid HDC’s continuous delay [to close the deal], the decision was inevitable to preserve the [airline’s] value as a corporation.           “For around a year and five months since April last year, [Asiana Airlines] has injected efforts to accomplish the merger and acquisition deal, and [I] feel sorry that the deal didn’t go through.”           In December, the HDC-led consortium agreed to acquire a 30.77 percent stake in Asiana Airlines from Kumho Industrial, as well as new shares to be issued, and Asiana’s six affiliates, for 2.5 trillion won.           Following the termination of the deal, Asiana Airlines will be managed by its creditors: KDB and the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Eximbank). The creditors acquired the airline’s convertible perpetual bonds worth 800 billion won. If they convert the bonds into stocks, the creditors will own around 37 percent of the airline’s shares to become its largest shareholder.           The creditors plan to sell Asiana Airlines once the market condition improves.           As of the second quarter, Asiana Airline’s debt ratio stood at 2,291.01 percent, up from 1,386.69 percent as of late last year.            The termination of the deal will likely result in employee layoff, especially as the recovery of the airline industry is taking longer than expected due to the ongoing pandemic.           The total number of employees, including of subsidiaries like Air Seoul and Air Busan, is 4,700 people.           Selling Asiana and its subsidiaries separately could be a solution to improve its struggles.           “Asiana Airlines has six subsidiaries, and some of them are sellable if they go out in the market separately,” said Prof. Hur Hee-young, who teaches business at Korea Aerospace University. “The size of Asiana Airlines needs to be reduced for it to become more attractive, or finding another buyer won’t be possible.           “It needs to be clear that Asiana Airlines, like Easter Jet, already suffered financially before the Covid-19 outbreak due to repeated decision-making errors, and its current financial struggles aren’t fully attributed to the virus.”           According to an Asiana employee, workers fear layoffs and have already begun preparing for the consequence of the deal falling apart.           “Employee reactions toward potential layoffs is divided into two groups,” said an Asiana Airlines employee. “One group is preparing to prove to the company that they’re valuable assets, while the other group is preparing to find a new career.”           Following the Friday announcement, HDC is likely to file a lawsuit to reclaim its 250-billion-won down payment.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleHDC not budging on demands for Asiana acquisitionAsiana Airlines catering quid pro quo draws big FTC finesTrillion-won discount for Asiana not discussed, KDB claims"

[KYOCHON F&B]                Kyochon F&B may become the first restaurant franchise in Korea to be traded on the Kospi after passing the preliminary screening for an initial public offering (IPO), the company announced Friday.           The fried chicken franchise plans to submit a registration statement this month to financial authorities as the next step toward the IPO. The underwriter is Mirae Asset Daewoo.           Kyochon has been pushing for an IPO since March 2018. It replaced founder Kwon Won-kwang with professional CEO Hwang Hak-su in 2019 to meet global standards in terms of business management. Kwon had been leading the group for 27 years.           The company also made changes to its governance structure. It acquired all shares in two of its affiliates — BHN Bio and KnP Food — to take ownership of them as subsidiaries last year. The two companies produce the sauces and pickled radish served alongside Kyochon’s fried chicken dishes.           Kyochon acquired the companies as subsidiaries to increase transparency and dispel concerns its affiliated businesses will be used for the private interests of major shareholders and third parties, according to the company.           Established in 1991, Kyochon has been the No. 1 fried chicken franchise in Korea since 2014. It recorded 21 billion won ($1.8 million) in net profit last year, an 83 percent increase compared to the same period a year earlier. Its operating profit was 31.9 billion won.           According to 2018 data, the average sales of Kyochon’s franchise stores was 618 million won, which the company said was the highest among chicken franchises registered with the Fair Trade Commission.           “We have arrived a step closer to becoming the first franchise to list on the Kospi. Kyochon will endeavor to become a global food company, as well as put efforts into promoting mutual growth of the headquarters and franchise stores through the IPO,” said an official from Kyochon F&B.            BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

Six of those groups held similar antigovernment protests on Aug. 15.           For the ninth consecutive day, Korea's new virus cases stayed below 200 on Friday, though it remains unclear if the government will extend Level 2.5 social distancing measures beyond this weekend.             Korea added 176 new coronavirus cases, of which 161 were local infections, slightly higher than the tallies in recent days.             Korea has confirmed a total of 21,919 Covid-19 cases as of Thursday midnight, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and four more people died, bringing the total death toll to 350.           There are 175 patients in critical condition.             More coronavirus cases linked to major general hospitals in Korea is raising further alarm.           At least 23 coronavirus patients have been traced to Severance Hospital in Seodaemun District, western Seoul, as of Friday, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.             Severance Hospital on Friday confirmed four new Covid-19 patients — three cleaning staff members at its Rehabilitation Hospital and one guardian. The hospital first confirmed a case on its nutrition team in charge of serving food to patients Wednesday, and subsequently reported more cases in the Rehabilitation Hospital among nurses, patients, their relatives and caregivers.           So far, 11 cases have been linked to the Asan Medical Center in southern Seoul this month, the latest being a pregnant woman who gave birth Thursday.           According to Asan on Friday, the woman in her 30s admitted to medical personnel immediately that she had suffered from cold symptoms for the past four days before visiting the hospital. She was moved to an isolation ward and confirmed Covid-19 positive after safely giving birth to her child. The baby tested negative but was also put in isolation.             Korea continues to see multiple clusters growing, including at elderly care centers and religious facilities.           The Seoul city government said that it will inspect 2,030 religious facilities in its 25 districts Sunday to make sure they are abiding by quarantine guidelines.             The Central Disease Control Headquarters said Friday that in the past month since Aug. 12, 34 percent of new Covid-19 patients have been over the age of 60.           According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Covid-19 can be more severe in people older than 60 years or who have existing health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes or immune system problems.             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
507,Tenant protection laws haven't stemmed rise in jeonse prices,"

     View of Gangbuk District, northern Seoul. [YONHAP]              It’s been over a month since the government’s tenant protection laws went into effect, but jeonse prices in Seoul have continued to go through the roof.       According to the Korea Appraisal Board, Seoul jeonse prices continued an upward trend for 63 consecutive weeks. They rose by an average 0.09 percent from Sept. 1 to 7 compared to the previous week.       During the same period, jeonse prices in the greater Seoul area — Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon — rose by 0.16 percent, continuing a streak of 57 consecutive weeks of increases.      Under Korea’s unique jeonse system, a person puts down a large lump-sum deposit in order to live in a property for a number of years. The deposit is refunded without interest at the end of the contract.      Last week’s increase in jeonse prices was largely led by small-sized cheap apartments.       In Mapo District, western Seoul, they rose by 0.15 percent. Jeonse prices of popular apartments in Ahyeon-dong, Gongdeok-dong and Dohwa-dong, and jeonse prices for flats smaller than 60 square meters (650 square feet) throughout the district increased.       In Seongbuk District, central Seoul, they jumped by 0.12 percent. The increase was largely due to soaring jeonse prices in new apartments in Gireum-dong and Jongam-dong.       Jeonse prices for apartments priced below 500 million won ($421,000) in Bulgwang-dong, Sinsa-dong and Eungam-dong in Eunpyeong District, northern Seoul, rose, while the district’s average jeonse prices increased by 0.08 percent.       In the Gangnam region, which refers to three districts south of the Han River — Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa — middle-sized apartments were the biggest factor fueling the increase in jeonse prices.      Gangdong District saw a 0.15 percent rise while Seocho District saw a 0.1 percent increase. Jeonse prices in Songpa District rose by 0.13 percent, led largely by middle-sized apartments in Jamsil and Sincheon-dong.      Gyeonggi was not an exception.       Jeonse prices in Gyeonggi rose by 0.21 percent. In the Giheung District of Yongin, they jumped by 0.45 percent, especially in Dongbaek-dong and Gugal-dong in which have better transportation options.       In Gwonseon District, Suwon, jeonse apartment prices jumped by 0.45 percent while those in the city of Gwangmyeong rose by 0.43 percent.     During the same period, jeonse prices in Sejong city also rose by 0.87 percent compared to the previous week.       Seoul apartment prices, on the other hand, have shown signs of stabilizing. From Sept. 1 to 9, Seoul apartment prices only increased by 0.01 percent compared to the previous week.       By regions, in Mapo District and Yeongdeungpo District, both in western Seoul, and Yongsan District and Dongdaemun District, central Seoul, apartment prices rose by 0.02 percent. In Gangnam District and Gangdong District, they increased by 0.01 percent.       “Apartment transactions have been decreasing due to the tenant protection laws passed by the government in July, as well as the impact of a prolonged Covid-19 pandemic,” the Korea Appraisal Board wrote.       BY CHOI HYUN-JU, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]    Related Article400 million won of jeonse doesn't get you much these days Rents cut for jeonse conversions in war on propertyAssembly passes bills, but jeonse tenants feel pinch"

509,"Seoul, Washington agree to new working-level dialogue channel","

     Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun, right, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun pose for a photograph after holding a meeting at the U.S. Department of State in Washington on Thursday. [YONHAP]               Seoul and Washington agreed to launch a new working-level dialogue channel to discuss alliance matters, said Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun Thursday after talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun in Washington.           “For the past 70 years, the Korea-U.S. alliance has served as the linchpin of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia,” Choi told reporters in Washington. “We agreed that Korea and the United States should continue cooperation and communication based on ironclad trust.”           The new consultative body, tentatively named the “Alliance Dialogue,” will be between director-general level diplomats from the two countries, said Choi.           He added, “Through this consultative channel, we plan to cooperate on diverse alliance matters at all times.”           The two countries already separately have a working group that discusses North Korea issues, including denuclearization, inter-Korean cooperation and sanctions enforcement, launched by Biegun and Lee Do-hoon, Seoul’s special representative for Korea Peninsula peace and security affairs, in November 2018. However, some critics have said that the working group impedes Seoul’s ability to pursue inter-Korean initiatives.           The new Alliance Dialogue is expected to be a separate consultative body from their bilateral working group on North Korea matters, and will deal with a different range of issues.           Biegun last visited Seoul in July, and the two sides at that time confirmed a need to “rejuvenate” the alliance.           Choi, who was on a three-day visit to the United States since Wednesday in his first trip abroad since he was named vice foreign minister last month, discussed with Biegun bilateral relations, the Korean Peninsula issue and a range of regional matters and areas of mutual interest, said Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Friday.           Their talks, expected to last an hour, spanned some 130 minutes.           Seoul and Washington have particularly struggled to seal a new defense cost-sharing deal after their previous 10th Special Measures Agreement (SMA) expired at the end of last year.           The two sides are “narrowing their differences” to advance defense cost-sharing talks through close communication between both the two countries’ top SMA negotiators and at the vice-ministerial level, according to the Foreign Ministry.           Biegun in a virtual forum on Aug. 31 also indicated that the United States is looking to expand its Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, involving its regional allies Australia, Japan and India, countries considered key to Washington’s Indo-Pacific Strategy seen to be aimed at containing China amid rising Sino-U.S. rivalry.           U.S. officials have mentioned South Korea as a possible country that could be included in such an expanded Quad structure, comparable to NATO.           Washington is believed to still be extending an invitation for Seoul to join an expand Group of Seven, or G7, summit, though that meeting has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.           Choi, the youngest-ever Korean vice foreign minister, hails from academia and previously served as a Blue House secretary for peace planning.           Choi also met with U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger to discuss bilateral relations and the Korean Peninsula situation.           Washington’s top diplomat likewise urged Pyongyang to return to dialogue and raised the possibility of humanitarian assistance to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and economic challenges amid a standstill in denuclearization talks, despite U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un still appearing to be on friendly terms.           “We then hope we can one day again have a serious conversation to convince Chairman Kim that the best thing to do for the people of North Korea is to fully denuclearize and that that will lead to a brighter future for the North Korean people,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News Wednesday.            Pompeo said he hopes to ""get humanitarian assistance there to assist them against that set of challenges.”           President Trump also tweeted on Thursday, “Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!”           The post is considered as damage control by some ahead of a new book, “Rage,” by acclaimed journalist Bob Woodward which discloses parts of peronsal letters exchanged between Trump and Kim.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

511,Retired colonel backs allegations of pressure campaign to give Choo's son special treatment,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae enters the ministry building in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi, on Friday.  [YONHAP]                A former commander of the Army’s unit responsible for managing the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army (Katusa) program on Friday became the first witness to publicly back allegations that military officials were pressured to give preferential treatment to Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae’s son.           Retired Col. Lee Chul-won released a statement detailing his position on the controversy surrounding Choo’s son, surnamed Seo. Seo served in the Katusa for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018, and Lee was the commander of the Korea Army Support Group, which oversees the Katusa program, during the period. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).             Colonel Lee did not specify who was behind the alleged pressure campaign.              Both Choo and Seo have denied all accusations that she abused her power to arrange favors for her son.           “When Seo was in boot camp, one of the staff officers reported to me that a request was made from outside to assign Seo to the Yongsan garrison,” Colonel Lee stated. “The staff officer rejected the request and explained about the process on how Katusa soldiers were assigned to bases. […] After receiving this report, I stressed to my staff officers that they must never accept any improper requests and warned them about various consequences.”             Colonel Lee also said he gave a lecture to family members of 400 Katusa soldiers at the graduation ceremony of the boot camp to ensure that they never make special requests to the military. He said he intentionally did so after he was informed that Seo’s family was at the event. “Although some media said I gave the lecture only to Seo’s family, I had no separate contact with them,” he said.             According to Colonel Lee, the military still faced pressure to select Seo as one of interpreters for the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.           “After the Defense Ministry sent a notice that it was selecting military interpreters, staff officers reported to me that they had received multiple phone calls requesting Seo’s selection,” he said. “I also received reports that such phone calls were made to the local unit of the 2nd Infantry Division.           “I told my staff officers that it would become a big problem and told the units to select interpreters by drawing lots,” he said. “Later, I visited [Seo’s] unit, gathered volunteers including Seo and drew lots.”             Colonel Lee also denied media speculation that he has a special relationship with People Power Party (PPP) Rep. Shin Won-sik, who made a series of allegations that Choo had abused her power on behalf of her son.             Shin, a retired general, has been publicizing statements he says were obtained from several former military officers, including Colonel Lee, to back the allegations.           “Shin was the commander of the 3rd Division and I was his chief of staff for three months from late January till late April 2011,” he said. “He was one of hundreds of officers who I had worked with during my 34-year military career. We had no contact since then, and we [recently] had our first phone call in nine years due to the latest scandal.”             Colonel Lee said he remained tight-lipped until now because he didn’t want his staff officers who are still in the military to face any trouble. He said he decided to come forward to correct misunderstandings about what had happened.           He apologized to the public for the scandal surrounding the unit he once commanded. “I hope this case will no longer be politicized and will serve as an opportunity to change the culture of seeking special treatment for soldiers. I also believe all the members of the military must be protected. I hope for a just and fair resolution to this case.”             Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun offered an apology to the public on Thursday about the scandal.             ""I feel embarrassed before the people for the issue,” Chung said during an interview with JTBC’s evening news program. Chung, however, did not indicate whether Choo would be sacked.             Chung is the first senior official of the Moon Jae-in administration to speak with regret about the issue. Many ruling party lawmakers have been defending Choo.             While offering an apology, Chung rejected the opposition PPP’s demand that a special investigation is necessary. “It takes a long time to establish a special investigation team,” Chung said. “It is better for the prosecution to quickly conclude the probe.”           Since opposition lawmakers filed a criminal petition to the prosecution in January, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office has been investigating the sandal. As the probe moved slowly for the past eight months, civic groups, whistle-blowers and lawmakers have begun talking to media outlets about the allegations surrounding Choo and her son.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]   "

514,Danish singer Christopher to drop duet with Chungha on Sept. 23,"

     Chungha, left, and Danish singer Christopher will be releasing a duet on Sept. 23. [MNH, WARNER MUSIC KOREA]               A special collaboration between Chungha and Danish singer Christopher will be released on Sept. 23, the K-pop star's agency MNH announced this morning.          According to the agency, Christopher, whose concert in Korea this year was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, expressed his desire to collaborate with a Korean singer on a duet that he’d been “treasuring for many years.”           Warner Music Korea apparently heard the song and suggested that Chungha would work best with Christopher on the song “Bad Boy.” The decision was made quickly, according to the agency, as Chungha was already a fan of Christopher and is familiar with his songs.           “Bad Boy” is a song about a purehearted man who pleads in honeyed accents to a girl he loves to love him back as he’ll become the “bad boy” she likes so much to win her heart. The song, according to MNH, has a K-pop vibe, quite different from the usual style of Christopher’s songs.           The Danish singer has a large following in Korea, where fans rate both his music and his looks. Christopher has often expressed his love for Korea since a concert here last year. After witnessing so many of his Korean fans singing along to hit song “Bad,” the singer said that the song is “probably one of my biggest, if not the biggest, song for me outside of Denmark.”           “It’s a song that exploded in Korea of all places,” the singer said in a virtual online concert he held three months ago, adding that his Seoul concert was “one of the best shows of all time.”           Chungha made her solo debut in 2017 and has released hits including “Why don’t you know,” “Roller Coaster,” “Stay Tonight” and “PLAY,” among many others.           BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Hwang Hee-Chan trains with the RC Leipzig squad in this picture posted on the club's Instagram page on Aug. 4. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               RB Leipzig forward Hwang Hee-chan looks likely to be in the squad for his new side’s first match of the season after manager Julian Nagelsmann praised his playing style in multiple interviews this week.           In a press conference in German on Thursday, Nagelsmann reportedly said that Hwang is a definite candidate for the squad’s first competitive match against FC Nurnberg in the DFB-Pokal cup on Saturday. The regular Bundesliga season is due to start on Sept. 18.           “[Hwang] is a player who is very [difficult] to defend. Not one that will score 35 goals, but one that will hurt the opponent a lot due to his speed and low center of gravity,” Nagelsmann was quoted as saying on RBLive.            The Korean forward joined RB Leipzig this year after spells at Hamburger SV and FC Liefering on loan from FC Red Bull Salzburg. Last season Hwang scored two goals across 20 appearances for Hamburger SV. He is also a regular on the Korean team and was a member of the 2018 Asiad winning squad.            Speaking to ESPN on Zoom earlier this week, Nagelsmann acknowledged that Leipzig will struggle to fill the gap left by Timo Werner, who scored 28 goals last season before moving to Chelsea this season. Again, the Leipzig manager mentioned Hwang.            “We have a success in Hwang, who makes a lot of runs behind the defensive line,” Nagelsmann said.           Leipzig will be back in action this weekend in the DFB-Pokal cup at 3:30 p.m. on Sept. 12 in Nuremberg, Germany, or 10:30 p.m. in Korea. The team’s first game of the regular Bundesliga season will be against Mainz at 3:30 p.m. on Sept. 20 in Leipzig, or 10:30 p.m. in Korea.           BY JIM BULLEY   [jim.bulley@joongang.co.kr]   "

517,[SPONSORED REPORTS] OB offers wholesalers a helping hand,"

     Oriental Brewery is doing its part by helping and protecting local businesses. [ORIENTAL BREWERY]         On Sept. 3, Oriental Brewery (OB) announced that it was allowing all of its wholesalers to postpone payment on outstanding invoices as a way of sharing the burden of the Covid-19 pandemic.OB said the decision was made following the recent increase in social distancing measures and the impact it has had on businesses and society.This is not the first time OB has taken action to assist local businesses and communities struggling as the economy is hit by the pandemic. OB offered a similar payment deferment scheme back in March, when Covid-19 cases spiked across Korea.OB also provided 1 billion won ($840,000) worth of masks and hand sanitizer to medical specialists in Daegu and North Gyeongsang where the number of cases was especially high back in March.Earlier this year, OB also donated 8,970 two-liter bottles of water to self-isolating patients.The company has also been quick to help out when other disasters struck. When Typhoon Maysak tore through Changwon and Sacheon in South Gyeongsang, OB donated 6,720 bottles of water. Geoje, also in South Gyeongsang, also received 2,240 bottles of water from OB after Typhoon Haishen.“OB aims to coexist and reciprocate with the local communities and entrepreneurs,” said an OB official in a statement. “We find no trouble with going out on a limb to support other businesses in times like this.”“OB’s greatest allies are small and wholesale businesses. That is why we decided to grant deferred payment to our buyers, to prove our No. 1 position in the Korean beer market is something we have earned and deserve.”By Ahn Tae-lahm [ahn.taelahm@joongang.co.kr]   "
518,Politics leads in this crisis as central bank out of ammo,"

     Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung on the left and ruling party leader Lee Nak-yon. The two politicians disagreed over the distribution of the second round of emergency relief grants. [YONHAP]               The approach to the current economic crisis differs greatly from the approaches to earlier crises. Because the economic environment has changed so much since 1997 and 2008, and due to the limits of past solutions, politicians are taking the lead rather than bureaucrats or central bankers.               In March, South Gyeongsang Gov. Kim Kyoung-soo proposed a basic income. Soon thereafter, Gyeonggi Gov. Lee Jae-myung argued over emergency relief funds with then-Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon. Ahead of the second round of emergency relief grants, sparks are flying between the prospective presidential candidates. Democratic Party Chairman Lee Nak-yon said he believes in selective disbursement, while the governor of Gyeonggi objects to limits on the program.             In 2008, politics were secondary. All eyes were on the central bank governor and the interests rates he controlled. The politicians and bureaucrats were relegated to the sidelines, as the central bank has a high degree of independence. It was the same in the United States, where the Federal Reserve took the lead.           A country has essentially two primary tools for fighting an economic downturn: interest rates and government spending. In 2008, Korea had plenty of room to maneuver. The base rate was 5.25 percent, and it was taken down five times between October 2008 and February 2009 to 2 percent.             When the coronavirus outbreak started, the base rate in Korea was 1.25 percent, and the central bank lowered it twice to 0.5 percent. In May, central bank Gov. Lee Ju-yeol said the base rate was close to the lower limit, suggesting that more cuts are not possible and are being contemplated. Federal Reserve governors have made comments that suggest much the same in the United States.                            ""The traditional methods of response to a financial crisis have run their course, and it has been proven that they are not enough, expanding the role of fiscal policy worldwide,"" Ha Joon-kyung, an economics professor at Hanyang University, told the JoongAng Ilbo.           ""Unlike during the global financial crisis, the coronavirus pandemic posed a threat to the real economy, amplifying the importance of fiscal policy,"" said Hong Chun-uk, chief economist at EAR Research.             Government spending is a political decision. For example, for the supplementary budget to take effect, the government must first develop a plan, and the National Assembly must then approve it.           ""The voices of politicians get louder with the heightened importance of fiscal policy. Because politicians will think of their political positions while recommending policies, it is inevitable that government spending measures collide with political interests,” said Ha.           Wariness surrounding populism has been emerging, as the heart of the stimulus plan shifted from monetary to fiscal policy.             ""Financial crisis is often the gateway to populism. There can be decisions on government spending based on political motives,"" said Hong.           ""It is hard to make a definitive conclusion that the advance of populism is due to the expansion in fiscal policy, but it is true that during times of crisis, politicians are more assertive with their populist ambitions,"" said Sung Tae-yoon, economics professor at Yonsei University.           BY YOON SUNG-MIN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   Related ArticleDP rep. accused of trying to bully internet portal"
519,"Machines haven't taken over yet, and that angers some","

                                   In an unexpected twist, the latest outrage is that humans might actually be choosing the news. Tech companies are insisting that this simply is not the case.           The snowball got rolling when a politician sent a text in which he complained that the headlines on Daum, which is owned by Kakao, are biased. The text was photographed by a journalist.             “Please lodge a strong complaint to Kakao about this,” Rep. Yoon Young-chan of the ruling Democratic Party wrote to an aide. “Kakao is being unreasonable. Tell them to come.”             The implication is that Yoon, who happens to have a background in technology, feels as though he can influence the company in terms of what news it puts on its splash page.             Naver and Daum claim that the news on their landing pages is chosen by computer. They say they use algorithms and that humans do not interfere. But neither has published details about how their programs make the selections.             As true artificial intelligence (AI) doesn't exist yet, real-time human input is often part of the calculus, with companies following the fake-it-until-you-make-it principle.             Yoon has apologized, but suspicion about the integrity of the programs remains.           Naver claims its algorithm has been choosing all of the news articles on the main page since last year. Daum says it has been using machines for five years to do the same.           In June 2015, Kakao implemented Rubics — an AI news selection service that recommends articles based on real-time user activity. Naver started utilizing the AiRS news algorithm in February 2017. Aside from the pages directly managed by media companies, the general news selection is driven by the software, Naver claims. Before the implementation of AiRS, Naver employees selected news items for the main page.                 Software caters to user taste          “DP Chairman Lee Nak-yon’s speech was not on Daum's main page. That was important news, and yet it wasn't there, so I wondered why,” Yoon told the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee on Tuesday.             As pages are customized for each user, news of the speech may have been on the pages of others even if it did not show up on Yoon's Daum splash page. For people who have accounts with the site, their reading and search history guides the choice of articles.             Daum's own records indicate that the speech did show up on the landing page, but it is possible that Yoon's browsing history resulted in the speech being left off that page.           For some, this is not the point at all. The problem for them is that Yoon thought he could influence news choice and that his confidence in the matter suggests that the tech companies would comply.           Are portals “irresponsibly” imputing the algorithm?           Critics say the tech companies should consider revealing the algorithms behind the news selection process. It is not enough to simply say that the program is working properly, they argue. They need to prove that assertion by allowing for an inspection of the code.           “It is wrong to say that the news selection by an AI algorithm is unbiased without analyzing how it makes such judgments,” Lee Jae-woong, Daum’s founder, said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. “The AI’s standards of value judgment and how it edits the news section should be revealed.”           He left the company in 2008.           Others question whether bias can be programmed in. Algorithms are written by people, and it cannot be claimed that their views are not reflected in the code until it has been reviewed.           “AI functions in ways that are built by humans, and hence it is ideal for portals to confirm their neutrality with the help of external algorithm review committees,” said Kim Seung-joo, a professor at Korea University School of Cybersecurity.             Rhee June-woong, a professor at Seoul National University's department of communication, disagrees: “The purpose of Naver and Daum’s algorithm is to maximize the time spent on their web page using the characteristics of their user base. Hence their AI news selection should be irrelevant to the discussion of neutrality.”           BY HA SUN-YOUNG, KIM JUNG-MIN   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "
520,Government permits export of protective face masks,"

                  Korea will allow the export of face masks that can be used to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) said Thursday.           The move comes as supplies of surgical and anti-droplet masks in the country have stabilized and earlier shortages have been resolved, the state administration said. Seoul had banned mask exports as it experienced acute shortages amid a spike in Covid-19 cases earlier in the year.           Under the changes that will go into effect on Tuesday, the government will allow masks to be made and sold freely under market rules and end mandatory supply for public use. In the past, 80 percent of all protective masks had to be diverted for public distribution.           Medical institutions that experience any kind of shortages will continue to receive support, the KFDA said.           It said while exports will be allowed, outbound shipment quotas will be set for each manufacturer. Exports cannot exceed 50 percent of masks produced by companies in a two-month period. In addition, restrictions will be implemented to prevent local businesses from buying up masks sold in the domestic market for export.           ""The changes are expected to allow market mechanisms to take effect that can allow the setting of appropriate prices and regulation of supply based on demand,"" a KFDA source said.           Yonhap   "
521,"Documents say justice minister, husband intervened","

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, center, is hounded by reporters as she goes to work at the ministry on Thursday. [YONHAP]               An opposition lawmaker released a Defense Ministry document that appeared to suggest Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae sought to get an extension of a medical leave for her son, amid an ongoing controversy about alleged preferential treatment he received while serving in the military.            In a release Thursday afternoon, the Ministry of National Defense said they could not confirm a record released by Rep. Kim Do-eup of the opposition People Power Party (PPP) that said Choo and her husband apparently filed a request by phone with the military to extend their son's medical leave for knee surgery from June 4 to 14, 2017, for additional days.            Instead, the ministry said the twice-extended medical leave Choo's son, surnamed Seo, eventually took was entirely legal. A ministry spokesperson said any serviceperson was allowed to take up to 30 days in medical leave in the event of an injury or illness, and that such a leave could be extended for a maximum of 20 days with permission from a commanding officer.           The statement undercut claims by the conservative opposition that Choo’s son — presumably with the backing of his mother, who was chair of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) at the time — had failed to return to duty at the end of his leave.           Choo’s son, surnamed Seo, was serving in the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, or Katusa. He extended the medical leave until June 23 and then used regular vacation rights allotted to him to rest another four days before returning to his unit.             PPP lawmakers claim Seo broke rules by calling his base to extend his leave rather than obtaining an additional permission from a military hospital before extending his leave. Anonymous whistle-blowers also claimed to media outlets that Choo or one of her aides had called the military personally to ask for the extension.           Those additional four days have become the subject of intense partisan wrangling, with the PPP calling for a special prosecutor to be assigned to investigate the matter given the sluggish pace of an ongoing probe of the issue by the state prosecution service.             The Defense Ministry’s response on Thursday addressed the opposition’s claims one by one, noting that Seo’s call to his commanding officer to extend his medical leave was within legal bounds. An additional medical assessment by a military hospital was not required as Seo was not taking leave to be interred at a civilian hospital, the ministry added.             A leaked record written by one of Seo’s commanding officers, a master sergeant, regarding his leave also showed the officer had suggested Seo use his personal vacation days first before later obtaining a necessary medical assessment to validate his leave.             As to whether Choo or an aide called the military to obtain the extension, the ministry said it could not verify whether there had been a phone call, but appeared to suggest some sort of request had been made on the matter.             Opposition lawmakers also took issue with a medical note filed by the doctor who diagnosed Seo at a hospital. In the note, which became the basis for the soldier’s weeks-long medical leave for knee surgery, the doctor wrote that Seo’s knee issue could be sufficiently treated at a military hospital but that Seo wanted to take a 10-day leave for treatment at a civilian center.             Several media outlets and PPP representatives jumped on the note to suggest Seo exaggerated his medical issues to obtain a medical leave, and that undue influence may have been exercised by Choo to make this happen.             That doctor on Thursday, however, told the JoongAng Ilbo that he never received any such pressure nor request, and that he had not even known Seo was Choo’s son at the time.             As to whether he believed Seo’s medical condition was serious enough to warrant the sick leave, the doctor said he could not comment further as he could not sufficiently recollect the case.             BY HAN YOUNG-IK, PARK YONG-HAN, SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
522,[NEWS IN FOCUS] 'Netflix Law' will not tame Netflix,"

     [SHUTTERSTOCK]               The so-called Netflix Law seems to be a problem for everyone but Netflix.           Local internet service providers and local streaming services are angry about the Telecommunications Business Act enforcement decree that was supposed to shift some of the burden of maintaining the internet network infrastructure toward the foreign companies, which have been burning up bandwidth due to the popularity of their programs in the local market.             The hope had been that the enforcement decree would level the playing field for local creators of films and shows and support the local telecommunications companies as it denied Netflix and others a free ride on a local network largely paid for by Korean companies.             Announced Tuesday by the Ministry of Science and ICT, the enforcement decree requires all companies to be treated the same and pay the same for the maintenance of the network if they cross a certain threshold. The threshold is the same for everyone.           It obligates providers with more than 1 million daily users and taking up more than 1 percent of total network traffic in Korea to be subject to the new regulation. By these standards, Google, Facebook and Netflix and two local operators, Naver and Kakao, will all be subject to the new regulation. Anyone violating the law will be fined 20 million won ($16,900).           Naver and Kakao are not happy.           Their complaints are numerous. They say that the criteria are vague, especially the part about 1 percent of the total network traffic in the country. They also note that if the trigger was set at 3 or 5 percent, Kakao and Naver might not have been included.           While it was supposed to capture the free riders, the enforcement degree just increases the costs for local players, they complain.           The Korea Internet Corporations Association, a nonprofit representing local internet companies, asked the government to re-examine the regulation and rewrite it from scratch.             ""We respect the decisions of Korean government and the relevant offices. We will abide by domestic law and will continue efforts to satisfy our customers,"" Netflix said in a statement.           A big concern for local content providers is the ""network usage fees."" Unlike Netflix, Kakao and Naver have already been paying tens of billions of won of “network usage fees” to telecommunication companies that install infrastructure for internet connections. With the new regulation, telecommunications service providers may ask for more.             The Ministry of Science and ICT says it listened to opinions of companies before making the decision on the decree. It added that foreign companies also participated in the discussions.           The new regulation is likely to affect ongoing legal cases.

523,Kakao Games makes a splash on first day of trade,"

     Kakao Games officials celebrate the company's public listing on Sept. 10 at the exchange's headquarters in Yeouido, western Seoul. [KAKAO GAMES]               Kakao Games hit its daily increase limit of 160 percent on its first day of trading on the Kosdaq market.           By market capitalization, Kakao Games is now the fifth largest company on the Kosdaq, ahead of pharmaceuticals company Celltrion.            The game company debuted strong on the Kosdaq. It opened at 48,000 won ($40), double its initial public offering (IPO) price of 24,000 won and at the 200 percent limit set by the exchange for first trades.           Within the first five minutes, the price spiked to its intraday trading limit of 30 percent and reached 62,400 won. It closed at that level.           At the end of the company's first trading day, its market capitalization was 4.6 trillion won. Even after the market closed, 27.5 million orders were waiting in line.            Trade volume was light, with 500,899 shares worth 31.2 billion won exchanged, as investors held back on their shares expecting a further increase in price, Korea Exchange data showed.             Prices are expected to continue upward, despite concerns of a possible overvaluing of Kakao Game’s stocks backed by the popularity of IPOs from retail investors, according to analysts.           “Market watchers consider the adequate market capitalization for Kakao Games to be in the mid-100-billion-won range. If it hits the market cap once more, that number will shoot up to 6 trillion. That could be a bit much compared to its estimated value,” said analyst Lee Jin-man, SK Securities.             Kakao Games’ price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which indicates the valuation of the stocks, showed signs of the stock price overheating. Large cap shares normally post a 20 to 30 P/E ratio. In the case of Kakao Games, that number was a whopping 316.75.             Brokerage houses estimate the game company stocks' price range should settle between 30,000 won and 40,000 won. Daishin Securities set the price at 33,000 won per share and Meritz Securities at 32,000 won per share.             Established in 2013, Kakao Games is a big publisher in both the mobile and PC games segment. The company also owns the Kakao Friends intellectual property.            In the past three years, the company has performed well. It posted a compound annual growth rate of 57 percent for the last three years. It posted a net profit of 27. 8 billion won in the second quarter this year.             Analysts say Kakao Game’s biggest strength is its ties with KakaoTalk, the most widely used messenger app in Korea, since it can utilize the network for marketing. According to Hanwha Investment and Securities, more than 13 million users receive advertisements from Kakao Games through the app.           Kakao Games says it will invest the capital raised from the IPO in strengthening its in-house game development sector. It has 10 new games in the pipeline, with two — Elyon and Odin — published by Kakao Games expected to land by the end of this year.             In response to the listing, its biggest shareholder and parent company Kakao's share price inched up 0.39 percent.           BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]         Related ArticleKakao Games generates strong interest from retail puntersKakao Games sees record-breaking IPO subscription rate"

     The Financial district of Yeouido, western Seoul. [YONHAP]                Asset management firms did well in the second quarter backed by strong returns in equity investments, according to a preliminary earnings report from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) Thursday.           Net profit for 309 asset management companies hit a record 317.1 billion won ($267 million), up 169.4 percent from the previous quarter and a 49 percent increase compared to the previous year.             Yields on stock investments were particularly high, increasing by 180 percent, or 212.2 billion won compared to the first quarter. This contributed to a 137.2 percent increase in quarterly operating profits, which reached 315.7 billion won.           “Deposits and profits increased as Korea’s stock market made a recovery after hitting rock bottom in the early stages of the pandemic,” said an official from the FSS.             Korea’s Kospi stock index has showed a V-shaped recovery from 1,457.64 in early March to reach the 2,400 mark in August.             Total assets managed by operators also hit a new high of 1.2 trillion won as of the end of June, a 37.1 trillion won, or 3.2 percent, increase from March.             Deposits in fund investments increased the most, by 22.8 trillion won, or 3.5 percent, in the second quarter compared to the end of March, followed by assets entrusted for investment management, which increased by 2.9 percent or 14.3 trillion won.            Publicly offered funds remained popular. Assets invested in such funds increased by 19.7 trillion won, or 8.2 percent, compared to March, continuing an upward trend since 2018. Among them, money market funds and derivative investments sold well, while assets invested in equity-linked funds declined.            Private fund investments increased 3.1 trillion won, or 0.7 percent, from the end of March. Out of 234 private asset firms registered, 42.3 percent were in the red, possibly as a result of recent scandals in the private equity business.           Profits earned from fees were 680.4 billion won, a drop of 3.7 percent compared to the first quarter, but a 2.4 percent increase over a year earlier.            The FSS plans to continue monitoring changes in assets and financial statements of vulnerable firms considering looming risk factors and economic uncertainties arising from the coronavirus pandemic.             A total of 309 asset management companies were registered as of the end of June. Among them, 75 managed publicly offered investment products and 234 operated privately managed investments.             BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]         "
525,"Kim Jong-un delegating control to cabinet, diplomatic source says","

     North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, center, inspects an area damaged by Typhoon Maysak in the country's eastern South Hamkyong Province, in a photo published by the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling party, earlier this month. [YONHAP]               North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is not ruling by proxy, as suggested by South Korea’s spy agency, but is governing the country through his cabinet, according to a Western diplomatic source based in Beijing.             The source, who requested anonymity, said the phrase “rule by mandate” — used by South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) to characterize recent changes to Kim’s governing style — created misunderstanding about the actual way in which the regime is being run.           The more likely explanation suggested by the source was that Kim was attempting to rule in a manner more akin to other executive branches around the world, delegating authority to members of his cabinet in their respective fields.             Kim’s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is responsible for foreign policy via-a-vis South Korea and the United States, the official said. Premier Kim Tok-hun and Central Committee Vice Chairman Pak Pong-ju are responsible for economic affairs and Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice Chairman Ri Pyong-chol and former security chief Gen. Choe Pu-il are overseeing the military.             By delegating both authority and responsibility to his closest deputies, Kim may be trying to steer North Korea’s transition to a “normal country,” departing from the one-man rule that characterized the regimes of his predecessors.             Kim Jong-il, the current leader’s father, for much of his early rule relied on the legacy left by his own father, the regime’s charismatic founder Kim Il Sung. In the latter part of his reign, the concept known as Songun, or a military-first policy, became prominent as Kim Jong-il became more reclusive and content with ruling through the country’s military.             With circumstances rapidly changing in his time, Kim Jong-un appears to have concluded that previous forms of governance that rely on propaganda and control over the party hierarchy may no longer be as effective to maintain authority.             The dictator in recent years has instead taken on much more of a populist image, with state media depicting him in the public's midst.           Kim’s decision in the aftermath of Typhoon Maysak last week to convene a ruling Workers’ Party expanded political bureau meeting in South Hamgyong, a badly damaged province, exemplified such a role. Kim sacked the party head of the province after around a thousand households were left homeless and vast tracks of farmland flooded as a result of the typhoon.             The leader further ordered over 10,000 party members in Pyongyang to assist the province in its recovery efforts, stressing he could not allow countless numbers of his people suffer ahead of the party’s 75th foundation anniversary this year, according to state media.           The source in China suggested Kim’s changing governance style also represented a major leadership transition process in Pyongyang. North Korea’s aging ruling elite, many of them members of Kim Il Sung’s generation, are being replaced by those who have made their bones developing the regime’s nuclear and missile programs, such as Ri Pyong-chol.           Kim may be attempting to delegate responsibilities to subordinates to mitigate — or at least redirect — the internal discord generated by this transition, the source said.           BY YOU SANG-CHUL, SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]         "

[AP/YONHAP]               Walt Disney is ""very pleased"" with initial results of its unusual release strategy for live-action movie epic ""Mulan,"" Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said at an investor conference on Wednesday.           Due to the coronavirus pandemic, ""Mulan"" was made available for purchase in the United States on the Disney+ streaming platform over the Labor Day weekend, and in movie theaters in a handful of other countries.           The film will debut in cinemas in China, the world's second largest movie market, on Friday.           ""We are very pleased with what we saw"" over the Labor Day weekend, said McCarthy, who spoke via online video to the Citi 2020 Global Technology Conference.           ""Mulan,"" a $200 million remake of an animated Disney classic about a female warrior in China, was designed to appeal to audiences in the country.            But the movie has run into controversy over its star's support of Hong Kong police and for being partly filmed in the Xinjiang region, where China’s clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims has been criticized by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups.           Disney had originally planned to release the film in theaters around the world in March but scrapped that plan when the novel coronavirus spread.           McCarthy said Disney ultimately decided to launch ""Mulan"" online in markets where Disney+ is available because many theaters remained closed and surveys showed most people were not ready to return to theaters during the pandemic.           ""It was not an easy decision to make because there were so many factors at play here,"" she said.           Samba TV, which tracks viewership on smart TVs, estimated that more than 1.1 million U.S. households paid $30 each to watch ""Mulan"" on Disney+ between Friday and Monday.             That would translate to $33.5 million in revenue from the film, plus additional earnings from anyone who became a new Disney+ monthly subscriber.           Samba TV said its estimates were calculated using data from smart TV owners who opted in to the Samba TV app and agreed to provide viewing information. Disney had no comment on the Samba TV figures.           Reuters   "

529,[NEWS IN FOCUS] Telecom companies get serious about education,"

     Models demonstrate the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite designed for LG U+'s new e-learning service. [LG U+]               Telecom operators are making a foray into online education amid growing demand for digital learning as people seek to avoid face-to-face contact during the coronavirus pandemic.           Prior to the arrival of Covid-19, major carriers including KT and LG U+ limited their offering to a handful of educational videos, but they recently took a further step by developing programs and subscription plans dedicated to teachers and students.           LG U+ rolled out a subscription plan for an educational service targeting elementary school students on Thursday, combining content from Educational Broadcasting System (EBS), a state-run educational television, with programs designed to help children practice English, Chinese and scientific experiments.           With a monthly payment of around 11,000 won ($9), the two-year plan will come with Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, which has an interface specifically designed for the service.             For other mobile devices, the platform is available in the form of an Android app.             “We plan to launch an iOS version soon and will let users of other telecom companies enroll in the service, though now it is only available for LG U+ users,” said Lee Seok-young, head of LG U+'s home media marketing communications team.           Some e-learning contents will be provided with augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) capabilities to make them more immersive.               An instructor tries KT's online class platform on Wednesday at Seoul National University Elementary School in southern Seoul. [KT]               KT is targeting teachers with its integrated platform designed to facilitate online classes.             The program, under test-operation by 11 elementary schools, is fitted with videoconferencing functions allowing for synchronous online class sessions as well as administrative features covering the management of schedule and students’ attendance and assignment reporting.           Teachers can also create online tutorials and materials on the platform that will be accessible with a link.             Under the agreement signed Wednesday with Seoul National University of Education, the pilot project will run through this year.           “[KT] will keep on improving it and plans to let private institutions such as hagwon [cram schools] use the platform,” the company said in a statement.           The telecom operator also partnered with Sigong Corporation, a smart-learning unit, to collaborate on developing e-learning courses serving home-schooling children.           KT said that the agreement, signed Wednesday, intends to bring together KT’s expertise in technology and Sigong’s proven record of developing educational content.           The two companies also vowed to develop educational technology to be exported abroad, without specifying what that entails.           Kang Kook-hyun, senior executive vice president at KT, said the company is keen on strengthening its presence in the education field.           “[KT] will contribute to reduce disparity in education at home and abroad by strengthening education technology business,” Kang said.           With the prolonged stay-at-home orders in light of the pandemic and many students registering with online classes, demand for educational technology is projected to rise.             Global education intelligence HolonIQ said that the market size of the sector will surge to $3,420 billion in 2025, from $1,520 billion in 2018.             BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

     A poster released by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday features BTS members promoting the Korean capital. [SEOUL METROPOLITAN GOVERNMENT]         Global phenomenon BTS will be featured in a promotional video of Seoul that’s scheduled to be released online Friday at 5 p.m.           The Seoul Metropolitan Government dropped the news in a Thursday press release, saying all seven members will be shown in the video introducing various tourist attractions of the Korean capital.             The clip, which is one minute and 50 seconds long, will be simultaneously uploaded on the official YouTube (www.youtube.com/visitseoul), Facebook (www.facebook.com/VisitSeoul/) and Instagram (www.instagram.com/visitseoul_official/) accounts of the Seoul Tourism Organization, the city said.           The Seoul city government continued in the release that the video, themed “See You in Seoul,” was designed to convey a hopeful message to all foreigners who can’t visit Seoul this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, and wish Seoul will be their first travel destination once international tourism resumes.             Each member of the boy band will take viewers on a virtual journey through Seoul based on a different theme, with member RM covering “Old but New,” Suga “Recharge,” V “Getaway,” J-Hope “Exciting Moments,” Jin “City Break,” Jungkook “Scenic Nature” and Jimin “Local Life.”           Seven teaser videos led by each member have been gradually revealed since Sept. 4 via the Seoul Tourism Organization’s YouTube, Facebook and Instagram accounts, which altogether have amassed over 24.7 million views and 23,000 comments so far, the city government said.           BTS has annually appeared in Seoul’s promotional videos since 2017, when the stars were tapped as the Korean capital’s honorary tourism ambassadors.                A poster released by the Seoul Metropolitan Government on Thursday features BTS members promoting the Korean capital.

531,Kim Jong-un lobbied hard for 3rd summit in letters to Trump: book,"

     U.S. President Donald Trump, left in center, and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walk on the North Korean side of the demilitarized zone in their third ― and impromptu ― meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom in June last year. [YONHAP]               Newly disclosed correspondence between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump revealed Kim had strongly hoped for a third summit last year, even after their second had ended in a debacle that February.             Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward obtained 27 so-called ""love letters"" exchanged between the two leaders, which are expected to be disclosed in his new tell-all book ""Rage,"" to be released on Sept. 15.             Two of those were published by CNN on Wednesday, both from Kim to Trump, detailing the dictator's hopes for additional meetings with the president, and written in notably flowery language.           In the second of the two letters, sent on June 10, 2019 on the first anniversary of the first Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, Kim recalled their meeting as ""an imprint still indelible"" in his memory, before asserting a confidence that their ""deep and special friendship"" would become a ""magical force"" in realizing their goals.             ""I believe the one day will come sooner or later when we sit down together to make great things happen, with the will to give another chance to our mutual trust,"" Kim wrote. ""Such a day should come again. It may well be recorded as yet another fantastic moment in history.""           Trump, according to excerpts of Woodward's book, had apparently been flattered by these letters, saying at one point that Kim ""tells me everything,"" including a grisly description of how he had executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, by a firing squad in 2013.           The president was also assuredly confident about his meetings with Kim, brushing aside criticisms that they lent legitimacy to the leader of one of the most secretive countries in the world.             Equally dismissive were Trump's views on assessments by his own intelligence officials that Pyongyang would never relinquish its nuclear weapons, according to Woodward. At one point Trump told the journalist that the CIA had ""no idea"" how to handle Pyongyang.           On Monday, perhaps in response to the upcoming book and its potentially damning effects to his reelection bid less than two months away, Trump said his use of the phrase ""love letters"" to describe his correspondence with Kim was just sarcasm.             Trump has repeatedly heaped public praise on his exchanges with Kim, including one rally two years ago when he said he ""fell in love"" with the dictator in Singapore.             That meeting certainly made history as the first time sitting leaders of the two adversaries met, but gave way to little in the way of a practical agreement on the North's denuclearization pledges.             A second attempt was made at Hanoi, Vietnam, in February last year, but Trump walked out of the summit prematurely after feeling the North's proposal to scrap its nuclear complex at Yongbyon was an insufficient trade-off for sanctions relief.             Though Pyongyang has insisted the personal relationship between its leader and Trump remains on good terms, it has since withdrawn back into its prior isolationism and vowed to expand its nuclear arsenal.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]    "
532,Kang stresses peace process on Korean Peninsula in Asean talks,"

     South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha speaks during the virtually-held 10th East Asia Summit (EAS) at the Foreign Ministry in central Seoul Wednesday, as a part of a series of Asean-related meetings set to run through Saturday. [FOREIGN MINISTRY]               South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha asked for the international community’s cooperation in moving the peace process on the Korean Peninsula forward, as she kicked off a series of virtual Asean-related meetings Wednesday.             Kang, during the 10th East Asia Summit (EAS), “stressed the importance of continued efforts toward the complete denuclearization and establishment of permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula,” according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry Thursday.             Recognizing the difficulties moving along denuclearization talks with Pyongyang in the past year, Kang went on to request support from the international community, including members of the EAS, for the “faithful implementation” of the North-U.S. Singapore statement, two inter-Korean agreements made in 2018 and the “early resumption of dialogue” with the North.            The EAS meeting is comprised of foreign ministers from the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations and key players in the region, including the United States, China and Russia.           Kang further explained that the South Korean government is “making efforts to improve the livelihood of North Korean people and improve South-North relations through inter-Korean cooperation” in quarantine measures, health care and humanitarian sectors.             The Asean Regional Forum (ARF), EAS and Asean Plus Three meetings running from Wednesday to Saturday come at a critical timing amid rising Sino-U.S. rivalry, a prolonged standstill in denuclearization negotiations with North Korea and the coronavirus pandemic which has nearly halted face-to-face multilateral diplomacy.            Tensions as the United States and China lock horns over security and trade matters, including concerns over the militarization of the South China Sea, loomed over the meetings as each side is looking to gain international support.           U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during the EAS stressed “U.S. support for principles of openness, inclusiveness, transparency and respect for international law,” calling it a part of its Indo-Pacific vision, said Morgan Ortagus, spokesperson of the State Department, Wednesday.             Pompeo raised concerns over China’s “aggressive actions in the South China Sea” and for the “imposition of sweeping national security legislation on Hong Kong,” she added.           He also urged North Korea to abandon its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.             Washington has been urging Seoul to participate in its Indo-Pacific initiative, seen as a strategy to contain China, and also has suggested South Korea participate in an expanded Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, involving U.S. regional allies Australia, Japan and India.             Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in turn accused the United States of intervening in the South China Sea and of being the biggest driver of its militarization.             Wang said, “Peace and stability is China’s greatest strategic interest in the South China Sea,” according to China’s Foreign Ministry.           Likewise, Kang said in the meeting that “peace and stability in the South China Sea is crucial for regional prosperity,"" according to her ministry in a statement, and stressed the importance of guaranteeing freedom of navigation and overflight in the area and the need to resolve the dispute peacefully through dialogue.             She further voiced expectations that countries would pledge to prevent actions that can escalate tensions and contribute to the militarization of the South China Sea, and for consultations to proceed on a code of conduct that can respect all countries’ interests in accordance with the international law.             Kang during the Asean Plus Three meeting, which brings together the 10 Asean countries and South Korea, China and Japan, stressed the importance of multilateral cooperation to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.           She also during the meetings highlighted Seoul’s continued efforts toward its New Southern Policy toward Asean countries.            Kang also asked for Asean nations to support Korean Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee's campaign to become the next director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO).            The Vietnamese government, this year’s host of a series of Asean meetings, confirmed that North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son-gwon would not be attending the ARF, scheduled for Saturday. The ARF is one of the few regional security forums regularly attended by Pyongyang, and North Korea’s ambassador to Hanoi is expected participate in the virtual meeting instead of Ri.             South Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun, on a three-day trip to Washington, was set to hold his first face-to-face talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun Thursday on efforts toward the peace process on the Korean Peninsula, among other bilateral alliance issues.             Lee Do-hoon, the South’s special representative for Korea Peninsula peace and security affairs, spoke over the phone Thursday with Chinese Vice Minister Luo Zhaohui, who reaffirmed Beijing’s commitment to cooperation with Seoul in the Korean Peninsula peace process.             On Wednesday, Suh Hoon, the director of the Blue House National Security Office, held a phone call with U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, and confirmed that the next several months will be crucial in getting North Korea back to denuclearization talks.             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

534,Fourth supplementary budget set at 7.8 trillion won,"

     From left, Democratic Party leader Lee Nak-yon, President Moon Jae-in and Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki attend a government emergency economic meeting at the Blue House on Thursday. The government has decided on a 7.8-trillion-won ($6.6-billion) fourth supplementary budget. [YONHAP]               The government has decided on a fourth supplementary budget of 7.8 trillion won ($6.6 billion).             If approved by the National Assembly, total spending in four supplementary budgets this year will amount to 66.8 trillion won, a record.             The government said it will submit the supplementary budget to the National Assembly on Friday.             The government stressed that the fourth supplementary budget, unlike the third, is focused on supporting small businesses and people particularly vulnerable to the recent spike in coronavirus cases.             Nearly half of the budget, or 3.8 trillion won, will be used for disaster emergency relief grants going to some 3.77 million people.             Some 3.2 trillion won of that amount will be given in cash grants of up to 2 million won to 2.91 million self-employed businesses.            The third supplementary budget funded emergency relief grants for all Korean households.             In detail, the government has decided to offer assistance of 1 million to 2.43 million won to self-employed businesses with annual revenues below 400 million won. The total budget for that assistance will be 2.4 trillion won.            Restaurants and coffee shops in the greater Seoul area whose businesses hours and services have been restricted due to the social distancing regulations will receive an additional 500,000 won. The total budget for the additional 500,000 won payments is 500 billion won. Some 323,000 business owners are expected to receive them.             An additional 1 million won will be given to 150,000 internet cafes, noraebang (singing rooms), small cram schools and indoor gyms that that have been forced to close.            Additionally, the government will be spending 1.4 trillion won to protect jobs by subsidizing some companies’ employees’ paychecks and those categorized as holding special jobs.             The subsidy is for companies that saw sales or production drop more than 30 percent in the last three months compared to the same period a year ago. It will help pay employees forced to take leaves.           The special jobs are held by people denied unemployment benefits including door-to-door salespersons, insurance salespersons and freelancers.            The government estimated it can help protect 1.19 million jobs.             It previously spent 10 trillion won on such special job security measures.             On Wednesday, Statistics Korea released a report that showed jobs shrinking in the sixth consecutive months. While the number of jobs that shrunk in August was somewhat lower than July’s, it still remained above 200,000.             The jobs report this month is expected to be even worse as August figures did not include the impact of the resurgence of the coronavirus in mid-August, heavy rains and two typhoons.             The government also plans to use the fourth extra budget to expand social welfare.           It includes 200,000 won for every Korean household with children in elementary school or younger.             In the first supplementary budget, the government gave 400,000 won to families for each child under the age of seven.             Subsidies for some 5.32 million children were given.            The fourth supplementary budget also includes a 20,000 won smartphone bill payment to every Korean aged 13 or older. Telecommunication companies will subtract 20,000 won from phone bills for one month.       The government has allocated 900 billion won for the phone bill payments.            The various kinds of government support including the phone bill payments will not be given to foreigners in Korea.            During an eighth emergency economic meeting at the Blue House, President Moon Jae-in stressed the impact of the spike in virus cases on the economy. Top government officials including Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki as well as Democratic Party leader Lee Nak-yon attended the meeting.            “Through seven emergency economic meetings, the government has come up with unprecedented bold measures to overcome the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus,” Moon said. “We have injected 277 trillion won of funds, which is equivalent to 14 percent of our GDP, in protecting jobs and companies while supporting the domestic market and revitalizing the economy.”             He said the Korean economy is enjoying the fastest economic recovery among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries while foreign investors have retained confidence in it.           “The government, whose job is to protect livelihoods, had no choice but to come up with additional measures with a heavy feeling of responsibility,” he said.             He asked the National Assembly and government to move quickly so funds from the fourth extra budget are released before the Chuseok holidays.           Moon added that the government has decided to temporarily raise the limit on gifts bought by public servants from 50,000 won to 200,000 won on agriculture and fishery products to support farms hurt by the recent typhoons and rains.          With total government spending this year at 554.7 trillion won while total income will be 470.7 trillion won, this year’s deficit has grown to 84 trillion won, more than double the 30.5 trillion won deficit expected at the beginning of this year.              With the fourth supplementary budget, the government’s debt is now 846.9 billion won, 106 trillion won more than last year.             The national debt-to-GDP ratio is now close to 44 percent, up 0.4 percentage points from 43.5 percent as of the third supplementary budget.           During a press briefing Thursday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki stressed that the current fiscal deficit and rising national debt was inevitable.            ""I hope it would be understood as a temporary situation,"" Hong said. ""Korea isn't the only country [with rising debt and fiscal deficits] as other major advanced countries are seeing similar problems.""           However, Hong stressed that Korea's situation is relatively better.            ""[International] credit rating agency evaluates Korea's fiscal status positively,"" Hong said.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
535,Parents' anger mounts over lack of interactive online learning in public schools,"

     A teacher at Bongeun Middle School in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, conducts an interactive online class with her students on Aug. 26 after schools in the capital area reverted to remote learning because of a spike in coronavirus cases. However, parents are complaining that their children spend most of their time watching prerecorded lessons instead, while some students have yet to have face time with their teachers in the new fall semester. [NEWS1]               Parents are balking at the poor quality of online classes for their kids as remote learning extends into a second semester amid a spike in domestic coronavirus cases.             Some parents expressed particular concern that their children haven't even been able to see their teachers some 10 days into the fall semester.           Ms. Kim, a working mother of two, remains concerned about remote lessons, as her younger daughter has yet to even hear her elementary school teacher’s voice since the new semester started.             Her older daughter has at least two or three Zoom classes per week, where she can have interactive lessons with her teacher and classmates, but her younger daughter has yet to have a face-to-face session.             Kim believes that her child has lost the drive to learn, simply staring at the computer screen all day without substantial interaction.             ""I cautiously suggested to the teacher, 'If you could even give a phone call to check on how the child is doing, and how she is following along, it would be a great motivation for her,’” Ms. Kim said.           The spike in Covid-19 cases last month has led to thousands of kindergartens and elementary, middle and high schools reverting to remote lessons in the Seoul, Gyeonggi and Incheon area until at least Sept. 20.           Parents especially have been venting their frustrations over the poor operation of remote lessons, which ideally should balance interactive sessions with prerecorded lessons.             When the pandemic forced schools to unexpectedly kick off the new spring semester remotely in April, they relied heavily on prerecorded lectures provided by the Korea Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) and YouTube lessons. But parents argue that shouldn’t be the case for the fall semester, after schools had plenty of time and experience to prepare for higher-quality remote lessons.             Such complaints are especially high among parents with children in public schools, which have a relatively low percentage of interactive Zoom-style lessons between teachers and students.             “On the day social distancing measures were raised to Level 2.5, the hagwon [private academy] that my child attends immediately switched to online classes,"" said Ms. Lee, another working mother whose fourth-grade daughter attends a public elementary school in Gangnam District, southern Seoul.            Level 2.5 social distancing measures have been in place since the end of August.             Lee added, “I am not sure why school teachers who were accepted to education colleges with outstanding grades, and passed the teacher certification examination, are not able to adjust as quickly as private academies.”             Many parents with children in public schools were enraged when they heard that some private elementary, middle and high schools are conducting all lessons through real-time interactive online classes.             A survey conducted by Jongro Haneul Education in April on hagwon students found that just 5.1 percent of students attending regular public high schools held interactive lessons, while 22.7 percent of those attending specialized or autonomous high schools had two-way interactive classes.             Several Blue House petitions have been submitted to protest the poor quality of public online classes.           “This is not remote learning. How long will our children be neglected?” reads one petition submitted at the beginning of the month. It had gathered over 29,800 signatories as of Thursday noon.           The petitioner mentions concerns from parents that their child, supposed to be learning remotely, “is just having a self-study session on YouTube.”             The petition also pointed out, “A true remote lesson is when the teacher meets the child’s eyes and conducts roll call.”             This petition's author requested that the teacher “just communicate with the student for one hour.”             But teachers likewise are pointing out that there isn't enough substantive support from their schools, local education offices and the government to conduct effective remote lessons.             “Some 70 to 80 percent of current teachers do not know how to hold real-time interactive online classes, but the office of education is not conducting any teachers’ training on how to conduct Zoom or Google classes,” said one teacher at a school in the capital area.             The teacher pointed out that the government is simply recommending the use of e-lessons provided by the Korea Education and Research Information Service (Keris) and that “schools are stingy with the purchase of equipment such as webcams and mics and only emphasize the role of the teachers.”             However, some teachers are also not showing much flexibility, causing division between younger educators who are capable of conducting interactive classes with their students and older ones who complain about the difficulties of adjusting to virtual lessons.             “Teachers are saying that interactive lessons are difficult, that they can’t do it, and because of such an atmosphere in teachers’ groups, the younger teachers who are capable of conducting such classes are not able to take charge,"" said a principal at a public elementary school in Gangnam District. ""There are some young teachers who are holding interactive classes without letting other teachers know.”             The Ministry of Education has encouraged increasing interactive classes, but also says it will be difficult to do so in a uniform manner.             In August, the Education Ministry conducted a survey of 225,000 teachers and found that interactive classes constituted just 14 percent of total lessons.             “We plan to increase the ratio of interactive lessons through indirect support, such as training programs and the provision of devices and content,” said an Education Ministry official. “Depending on the subject, it may be more effective to prerecord content or focus on assignments, so it is difficult to just stress conducting real-time lessons.”             Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae likewise told the National Assembly’s Education Committee on Aug. 25 that the percentage of interactive classes in the first semester was about 10 percent, but that “it should be possible to bring this up to 20 to 30 percent in the second semester.”             But parents are urging education authorities to take a more aggressive approach in improving remote learning.             “We don't even expect 100 percent interactive classes,” said one parent from Mapo District, western Seoul. “Isn’t it a problem that we are in the second semester and remote lessons are students just watching prerecorded videos? The government needs to step forward and improve this situation.”             BY KIM GYEONG-MI, SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]            "
536,New York City restaurants to partially resume indoor dining at end of month,"

     New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio eats lunch with staff members outside the Wo Hop restaurant in the Chinatown area of New York City, U.S., on Aug.11, 2020. [REUTERS/YONHAP]               New York City restaurants will be able to resume indoor dining at 25 percent capacity at the end of the month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday, relaxing one of the last big Covid-19 limitations in the nation's most populous city.           New York City has been the only region in the state where indoor dining was not allowed during the third phase of its reopening plan, as health officials worried that people eating inside without masks could spread the novel coronavirus.           Cuomo said the decision was made following compliance and rule enforcement improvements. He said the city's coronavirus positivity rate, the proportion of daily tests with positive results, holding steady below 1 percent was another important factor.           The city banned indoor dining in mid-March as the pandemic worsened. Hammered by the loss in business, restaurants looked to takeout and delivery orders to keep them afloat.           In June, outdoor dining was approved, and restaurants got creative by putting tables on sidewalks, rooftops and even boats, festooning them with lights, umbrellas and festive decor.           A plan to reopen indoor dining in July was delayed due to Covid-19 concerns.           Restaurateurs cautiously welcomed the news.           ""Twenty-five percent is not that much, but it's something where you can do some math and know, more or less, how many customers you can have every day,"" said Giovanni Gelfini, the owner of Santa Panza, a restaurant in Brooklyn.           Julie Lumia, co-owner of the venerable theater district restaurant Joe Allen, said she can rehire about 15 percent of the staff with the limited reopening, but will still lose money.           ""We'll exist again, that's the important thing,"" she said. ""But we really have to see how comfortable everybody feels about going inside. It's a tricky one.""           At a news conference, Cuomo acknowledged the risk of future outbreaks but also stressed the economic pain the restrictions have caused. He said capacity could be lifted to 50 percent by Nov. 1.           ""A restaurant is not just the restaurant owner. ... There is a whole industry around restaurants,"" Cuomo said.           The state will expand its task force charged with enforcing restaurant compliance, and New York City will provide 400 additional inspectors to support that effort, he said.           Restaurants will have to check the temperature of customers at the door and obtain contact information for contact tracing should there be an outbreak.           Cuomo said the state would also establish a system encouraging customers to report restaurants not in compliance.           ""This may not look like the indoor dining that we all know and love, but it is progress for restaurant workers and all New Yorkers,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said.           Reuters          "
537,LG Chem sends lithium-sulfur battery into the stratosphere,"

     The unmanned air vehicle EAV-3 powered by LG Chem's lithium-sulfur battery prepares to take off on a test flight in Goheung County, South Jeolla, on Aug. 30. [LG CHEM]               LG Chem successfully completed a test flight of an unmanned air vehicle powered by its lithium-sulfur battery, the company said Thursday.           Unlike the lithium-ion batteries currently used in electric vehicles (EVs), lithium-sulfur batteries are a relatively new technology considered one of the contenders for the all-important next-generation battery — a smaller, lighter, more powerful battery considered crucial for the long-term growth of the EV market.           Lithium-sulfur batteries use sulfur in the battery’s cathode, instead of the magnesium, cobalt and nickel composition found in lithium-ion batteries. Replacing the cathode material with sulfur allows for a lighter weight, higher energy density per weight and lower cost, LG said.          The test flight was the first attempt in Korea to use a rechargeable energy source other than lithium-ion batteries to fly an unmanned air vehicle.           The vehicle used was the EAV-3 developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI). Measuring 9 meters (29 feet) in length with a 20-meter wing span, it weighs 21 kilograms (46 pounds), excluding the battery.           Made to work on eco-friendly energy sources, the EAV-3 is normally powered by lithium-ion and solar batteries. In LG’s test flight on Aug. 30, the EAV-3 flew for 13 hours. During the day, it rose to as high as 22 kilometers (14 miles) above the ground, setting a domestic record for unmanned air vehicles, according to LG.              LG Chem's lithium-sulfur battery. [LG CHEM]         For seven hours of the flight, the EAV-3 flew in the stratosphere, between 12 and 22 kilometers above the ground. This layer of the atmosphere is more frequently used by large-sized passenger airplanes and isn’t normally accessible to small-sized aircrafts like the EAV-3.             The performance was the result of an 18-month testing period in which LG Chem’s research team had to recreate stratospheric environmental conditions to find the best way to increase the lithium-sulfur battery’s performance in the air.             “The test results are meaningful in that it proved our lithium-sulfur battery can function stably in the stratosphere, an extreme environment where the temperature goes down to minus 70 degrees Celsius [minus 158 degrees Fahrenheit] and the air pressure is only four percent of the earth’s surface,” LG Chem said in a statement.           The battery maker added that the next experiment would be flying the aircraft with the lithium-sulfur battery for days, instead of hours. As for the next-generation battery’s commercialization, LG said it plans to start mass production in 2025.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

542,Coronavirus cluster breaks out at Severance Hospital,"






     The Rehabilitation Hospital at Severance Hospital in Seodaemun District, western Seoul, is placed under cohort isolation Thursday after several coronavirus infections were traced to the building. [YONHAP]         At least 17 coronavirus patients have been traced to Severance Hospital in Seodaemun District, western Seoul, since Wednesday, health officials said, raising concerns about one of the nation’s largest hospitals.           Ten infections were reported among employees of the hospital’s nutrition team in charge of serving food to patients, while the rest of the infections came from the Rehabilitation Hospital — among nurses, patients, their relatives and caregivers.           Health authorities said Thursday that the two clusters seem to be linked, though exactly how is unknown.           The nutrition team workers, dispatched from a subcontractor of the hospital, were stationed in a different building, but contact tracing is underway to figure out whether they had direct contact with people at the Rehabilitation Hospital, officials noted.           Among the 17 infected people, the first to have been diagnosed was a worker on the nutrition team who tested positive on Wednesday.            The Rehabilitation Hospital was placed under cohort isolation Thursday — the shutting down of an entire building or institution to prevent a possible spread of the virus. Health officials said all patients, their caregivers and workers inside the building would be tested for the coronavirus.             The rest of Severance Hospital remained open for outpatient services.            The cluster emerged as the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) announced Thursday morning that 155 infections were detected nationwide Wednesday, barely under the 156 cases detected the day before.           It was the eighth day in a row that daily cases were under 200.           Fourteen were imported cases, while 141 were local infections, including 47 in Gyeonggi, 46 in Seoul, 12 in South Chungcheong, 11 in Daejeon, five each in Incheon and Gwangju, four in Ulsan, two each in North Chungcheong and North Gyeongsang, and one each in Busan, Daegu, Gangwon, North Jeolla, South Jeolla, South Gyeongsang and Jeju Island.           Among Korea’s 17 major cities and provinces, Sejong City was the only place that had zero new patients.             Of the imported cases, two each were from the United States, Uzbekistan and Russia, while one each was from the Philippines, Kazakhstan, India, Japan, Kuwait, Ecuador, Kenya and Australia.             Two people died Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 346, while 337 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 17,360.                              As of Wednesday at midnight, Korea’s total number of Covid-19 patients had reached 21,743.           While daily cases have significantly dropped from late last month’s 300 to 400 cases, Yoon Tae-ho, an official at the Central Disaster Management Headquarters, said in a Thursday press briefing that this week’s day-to-day infections were “tricky” for central health authorities wondering whether the “Level 2.5” social distancing measures should be lifted.             The greater Seoul area — Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi — have been under Level 2.5 restrictions since Aug. 30, while the rest of the country has been subject to Level 2 measures in the three-tier social distancing system.           “We’ve been maintaining daily new cases between 100 and 200 for eight days in a row now, but we want the figure to drop more than that,” Yoon said in a Thursday press briefing.             “If the figure drops below 100, it would be a very positive sign, one we [central health authorities] would crucially take into consideration when deciding” whether to lift the Level 2.5 measures next week, he continued.             The last time Korea’s daily infections were under 100 was Aug. 12, the same day the first infection was discovered at the Sarang Jeil Church, which soon swelled into the second-largest cluster Korea has seen to date. At least 1,167 patients have been traced to the church cluster.             As flu season nears, health authorities also urged people to get flu shots as soon as possible, warning many flu symptoms were similar to those of Covid-19, which could make it difficult to distinguish between the two when coming down with either.           BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
543,"Doctors, gov't still in dispute over medical licensing exam","

                  Doctors and the government are at odds over whether to give medical students another opportunity to take the state medical licensing exam, another sticking point to be addressed as trainee doctors returned to work, ending a nationwide strike over a new medical reform plan.          Most trainee doctors, such as interns and residents, at general hospitals ended their collective action and returned to work since earlier this week, following an agreement with the government to put the reform plan on hold.           However, doctors have continued to demand that the government allow medical students to retake the medical licensing exam that began Tuesday. About 90 percent of test takers have boycotted the state exam in protest of the plan.           The Medical Professors Association of Korea, representing professor-level doctors at general hospitals, on Thursday urged the government to hold the exam once more in accordance with the agreement.           ""There will be more big problems both in the short and long term if the exam is not held properly,"" the association said in a statement. ""We will further act with medical students and young doctors if the agreement is not properly carried out.""             The Korean Medical Association (KMA), the country's largest doctors' association representing some 130,000 doctors, also earlier pressed the government to allow medical students who had withdrawn their applications to take the exam.           The government, however, reiterated its earlier stance that the agreement is irrelevant to the exam, saying there is little need to discuss an additional chance for the exam.           ""The agreement between the KMA and the government is already open to the public and does not include an additional exam for the medical students,"" Health Ministry spokesman Sohn Young-rae said in a briefing.           On Friday, the KMA agreed with the ruling party to end its nationwide strike after the government backed down and promised to put the medical reform plan on hold in a joint effort to overcome the novel coronavirus pandemic.           Some 160,000 trainee doctors working at general hospitals began the strike on Aug. 21 to protest the government's medical reform scheme that calls for increasing admissions for medical students, establishing a new public medical school and extending medical insurance coverage to traditional medicine.           KMA members and fellow doctors have also joined the collective action to support the junior doctors.           Yonhap         "
544,Vixtorm captain Park adds some old wisdom to a young team,"

      Park Chul-woo of Suwon Kepco Vixtorm poses for a photo at Vixtorm's gymnasium in Uiwang, Gyeonggi, on Sept. 7. [KIM SANG-SEON]              Park Chul-woo joined the struggling Suwon Kepco Vixtorm this season with one goal in mind: Victory.           “We have to win,” Park said. “I came here to win.”           For the past two seasons, Vixtorm has been considered one of the weakest teams in the Korean Volleyball Federation (KOVO), as they failed to qualify for the playoffs and finished dead last in the regular season standing. This season, things are looking a little different.            Park has lived up to his promise, already helping the Vixtorm win the KOVO Cup, a preseason tournament, by defeating the Incheon Korean Air Jumbos 3-2 at Jecheon Gymnasium in Jecheon, North Chungcheong, on Aug. 29. Park played a significant role in leading the team to victory.           When the 2019-20 season ended earlier than expected, Park became a free agent (FA) for the second time in his career and signed with the Vixtorm.            He earned his very first FA status back in 2010 and signed with the Deajeon Samsung Fire&Marine Insurance Bluefangs. At the time, his signing received a lot of attention as the Bluefangs’ head coach Shin Chi-yong, who now serves as the head of the National Training Center in Jincheon, North Chungcheong, was also Park’s father-in-law.            It’s been 10 years since Park's first FA status. This time, he says, he feels less pressure.            “Unlike that time, I feel a little more comfortable,” Park said.            “At the time, [the team I signed with was] the team we were competing against and there was a lot of talk. [But now] head coach Chang Byung-chul and the coaches don’t give me any pressure. Also, my teammates are trying to help me.”           After spending years as a Vixtorm coach, Chang was appointed as head coach of the club last year. Since being appointed, he has been working to rebuild the team with younger players. Despite his focus on developing younger players, Chang still decided to sign KOVO veteran Park, who is in his late 30s, because the team needed a leader.            “Chul-woo is like a bridge for communication [with players],” Chang said.            “Our players and head coach have a big age difference,” Park said. “My job is to tell our head coach about what our players want. And our head coach listens to them well.”           Having won the KOVO Cup, the young Vixtorm players can get excited about the upcoming season, but both the head coach and Park said it’s not time to get excited just yet. Although the Vixtorm will play the same clubs as they did at the KOVO Cup, their record at the cup does not carry over to the regular season.            Due to this, Park says that it’s time to work even harder.            “Whenever I won, we only celebrated for like five minutes and then started preparing for the upcoming season,” Park said. “To be honest, during the league [regular season], other teams will get better. But I came to Vixtorm to win.”           At 35, Park is definitely no longer one of the league's youngsters. As volleyball requires a lot of jumping, blocking and spiking, Park knows that he's now playing with a very different body compared to back in his heyday.            “My body doesn’t feel as light as back when I was in my 20s,” Park said. “It’s O.K. when I’m jumping to attack, but when I jump to block, my body feels heavier than in the past. But I’m satisfied about [being able to play] volleyball.“           To keep up his physical strength for the upcoming season, Park has tried different things.            “[In 2016,] when I was [fulfilling my military duty as] a public service worker, I lowered my body fat and increased my muscle mass. But that didn’t seem to suit volleyball. Last season, I tried to be a vegetarian. It did make my body feel lighter, but I couldn’t jump as high. So now, I just focus on eating regularly and giving myself enough rest.”           Looking at the Vixtorm’s performance in the past two seasons, they’ve only managed to pick up 10 wins throughout 68 matches.            But with the fast development of their young players and the addition of Park, the struggling club is hoping to finish in the middle of the regular season standing this year.            To do so, head coach Chang has chosen Park as the Vixtorm’s captain.            “As we keep on winning one match at a time, our players start to gain confidence,” Park said. “The young players on our team are improving surprisingly quickly. I personally have high expectations [for the young players on our team].”           The 2020-21 V League is expected to start on Oct. 17.            BY KIM HYO-KYUNG   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

546,Rangers place Choo on IL after run-scoring wrist injury,"

     Choo Shin-soo of the Texas Rangers, left, slides to home plate during a game against the Seattle Mariners at T-Mobile Park on Sept. 7. [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]               Choo Shin-soo of the Texas Rangers was hoping for another strong season, but things are not working out in his favor.           The Rangers announced on Wednesday that Choo will be added to the Rangers’ injured list (IL) after spraining his wrist.            Choo picked up the injury while sliding to home plate during a game against the Seattle Mariners on Monday. Although the veteran was safe on the play, he seemed to be in pain as he jammed his hand into the ground while sliding.            Following the game, Rangers’ manager Chris Woodward said that there weren’t any structural damages based on the X-ray and that he hoped to see the veteran designated hitter back in the roster.            But unfortunately, that wasn’t to be.            If Choo makes a fast recovery, he will be able to return to the lineup on Sept. 18.            Although there isn't that long left in the shortened MLB season, due to end by the end of September, Choo is determined to return to the lineup before the season finishes. This is already the second time that Choo has been injured this season. Last month, the 38-year-old had to miss a few games due to a calf injury.            “I never want to think about finishing the season with any injury,” Choo was quoted as saying on MLB.com. “That is important. Nobody else may care about it, but just for myself, I don’t want to finish the season with an injury.”           Choo is playing the last year of his big seven-year $130 million contract with the Rangers. Since Choo will once again earn free agency after this season, his injury could pose a serious threat to his future career.            This season, Choo has appeared in 32 games for the Rangers with five home runs, 13 walks and 15 RBIs with a 0.229 batting percentage. Although there were rumors he could be traded, Choo has stayed put in his role as the Rangers’ leadoff.            Last year, Choo’s season was all about home runs. He had one of the best seasons of his career with a new career high in home runs in a single season, at 24. Along with that, he made headlines by hitting his 200th home run after 15 years in the majors. By doing so, he became the first Asian player in the major league to ever hit more than 200 home runs.            This season, Choo once again set another record among Asian major leaguers in RBIs. Choo currently has career RBIs at 782, beating Ichiro Suzuki’s record of 780.            Throughout Choo's career in the majors, he has a 0.274 batting average with 218 home runs and 782 RBIs.            Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the major league shortened its regular season to 60 games. Since the Rangers are not looking at a shot at the postseason this year, as they are ranked at the very bottom of the American League West standing with 15 wins and 27 losses as of Wednesday, the end to their season is fast approaching.            Choo is currently the oldest Korean to play in the major league, and, aside from the occasional injury, his age doesn’t seem to have held him back.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
547,Second-year boy band Oneus says the real journey starts now ,"

     Boy band Oneus sat down with the Ilgan Sports to talk about the recent release of its fourth EP ""Lived,"" released on Aug. 19. [PARK SE-WAN]         Second-year boy band Oneus said its real journey starts now when it celebrated the recent release of its fourth EP “Lived"" last month. The group has garnered attention in the K-pop industry as a talented rookie boy band since its debut in January last year with its EP “Light Us,” but after earning the title of ""onstage genius” by finishing in fourth place on Mnet's boy band competition show ""Road to Kingdom” in June, Oneus is determined to live up to its rising popularity and nickname.             The Ilgan sports sat down with Oneus to talk about its new EP released on Aug. 19 and its teamwork as a second-year boy band.        Oneus' fourth EP ""Lived."" [RBW]               The lead track ""To be or Not to be"" on its new album shows off the band's strong stage presence and outstanding live singing skills. As the title of the song hints, Oneus members embody the feeling of agony when facing a crossroad of fate on stage.             ""The song has several variations, and the choreography changes in every transition. That’s why the song’s choreography was especially difficult, but we practiced a lot so we are confident we will do well on stage. The viewers won’t be bored watching our performance because there is a clear introduction, development, turn and conclusion in our choreography.”           The band’s fandom has expanded after proving each member’s talent through ""Road to Kingdom."" Sales of the new album in the first week after its release far exceeded the sales of its previous releases. According to Hanteo Chart, the cumulative sales surpassed 50,000 copies on the sixth day of its release, which is fourfold growth compared to its previous release.             ""The album sales records and song rankings are important too, but our goal is to have as many people as possible recognize our music. We wanted to show how much we have grown through our new song 'To be or Not to be,’ and I hope that our new release can appeal to the public. It will also be fun to explore hidden meanings in our song.”        Boy band Oneus sat down with the Ilgan Sports to talk about the recent release of its fourth EP ""Lived,"" released on Aug. 19. [PARK SE-WAN]               One and a half years after its debut, Oneus members say they now have stronger teamwork.             “As our way to show our teamwork, we always talk to every staff member as a group before we begin a shoot. We had a private team dinner recently, and we shared our thoughts about our plans as Oneus. We agreed that the more we perform, the better we dance together. Now we can tell what the other members are thinking just with eye contact.           ""Our wish is to stay healthy and not get hurt so that we can perform for our fans as long as we can. Right now it's hard to meet our fans due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but we'll try to find other ways to communicate with our fans. For the fans who’ve waited for us, we will try to repay them with our promotional activities.""           The six-member band debuted in January 2019 as the first boy band from the entertainment company RBW, which also represents girl group Mamamoo.            BY HWANG JEE-YOUNG   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

[SEOUL TOURISM ORGANIZATION]               With the end of the tunnel still not in sight when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic, the travel industry continues to seek ways to stay afloat. This industry in particular was one of the hardest hit due to the halt put on international travel and the strict quarantine measures in place in Korea.           To contemplate what services and knowledge will be essential in the post-pandemic period, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, in collaboration with the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO), has opened an academy for potential travel industry entrepreneurs.            They will select a total of 45 students from Oct. 8 for a four-hour session every Thursday for five weeks.These sessions will see travel industry experts share their knowledge and experiences so that the new essential services can be identified and further developed.

The 10-week program will delve into how to make online content and run advertisements, as well as how to estimate how well such content will perform.           Other shorter sessions are available for those who want more specific training, such as video marketing or design. The organization also plans to hold online lessons through YouTube from Oct. 20 to share information about the newly rising trends in the travel industry.           Seoul Tourism Organization is also helping travel interpreters who have not had much business cross into the online world and become travel influencers. As they can communicate with people overseas speaking other languages than Korean, they can have an easier time promoting travel content with their own videos and photos, the company thinks.           Since late last month the KTO has been hosting an event after seeing people in Japan were interested in getting photos of their dolls in different places. It has recruited participants who desire to travel to Korea as a way to maintain their interest until they can visit in person.           It selected a total of 10 stuffed dolls to feature at major travel destinations that are popular including the cafe-heavy Ikseon-dong in central Seoul as well as the indie-culture-abundant Hongdae area in western Seoul. These dolls also went to spots where TV drama “Itaewon Class” was filmed in central Seoul, and even made their own transportation cards to get around for the photos.               YouTuber Jessica Lee explains Filipino food adobo on her channel.

552,[Into the heart of the country] Fairy-tale fantasies are just the beginning when it comes to the castles of the Czech Republic,"

     The area surrounding Litomysl Castle in Pardubice region of the Czech Republic. [CZECH TOURISM/LIBOR SVACEK]                     The 2,000 castles and chateaus of the Czech Republic may look like they've come straight from a fairy tale, but a closer look reveals centuries of realities that shaped the nation.           “Hop in a car and explore the romantic castles of the Czech Belle Époque,” said Gustav Slamecka, Czech ambassador to Korea. “Easily reachable from Prague is the Konopiste Castle, once the home of Franz Ferdinand d´Este, whose assassination triggered World War I. Further, Chateau Hluboka, located on the way to Cesky Krumlov and built in the style of England's Windsor Castle, was featured in K-pop music video L.O.V.E with Park Ji-hoon. For gothic castle lovers, there is Bezdez Castle, Castle Zvikov or Castle Klapy [also known as Hazmburk Castle]. For those who fancy Cesky Krumlov, I’d also recommend a visit to Loket.”           Many of these castles were built in the Medieval Ages and renovated during the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical and Romantic periods. Litomysl Castle — with its two-storied, arcaded gallery in the southern wing, neoclassical theater in the western wing and an interior that is Renaissance in design with lavish late Baroque ornamentations — has even been recognized by Unesco for its authentic integration of the original state with hundreds of years of successful modifications.             “No attempt has been made to select a particular period to display, but instead the organic evolution is presented in its entirety,” Unesco says about the castle on its website. “The current form and appearance, including the floors with open Renaissance arcades in the courtyard and sgraffito decorations on the facades and on the gables, are defined by the original design.”              Czech Ambassador to Korea, Gustav Slamecka, speaks with the Korea JoongAng Daily at the Czech Centre Seoul in central Seoul on Aug. 10. [PARK SANG-MOON]         Located 100 miles east of Prague in the Pardubice region, the castle is not the only attraction in the city. At the city’s center is the 500-meter (1,640 feet) long Smetana Square. One of the largest public squares in the country, it is lined with arcaded facades in Baroque, Classicist and Renaissance styles and holds a Gothic-styled town hall tower.              Slamecka recently sat down with the Korea JoongAng Daily to offer his tips on what to look for during a visit to the historic castle of Litomysl and its city. The following are edited excerpts of the interview.         How did you come to select Litomysl Castle as the heritage site in the Czech Republic to introduce to readers in Korea? I chose Litomysl for many reasons. First of all, it is a place where visitors can experience the castle and also visit gardens, churches and a convent preserved in the city center. It is also the birthplace of Bedrich Smetana, one of the most important Czech composers, and today is often the venue for music festivals. The castle is located above the town center on Castle Hill and surrounded by a French formal garden and an English style castle garden — which isn't unusual on the premises of important castles in the Czech Republic — and also features a brewery, riding hall, stables and carriage house.  Litomysl is less crowded than some other tourist spots, which can be appreciated especially when staying overnight. The city of Litomysl has just over 10,000 citizens.Next to the castle there is a recently renovated convent complex with gardens with modern art, like Olbram Zoubek statues, and with two churches worth visiting. These churches have quite similar names — the first is called Piarist Church of the Discovery of the Holy Cross and the second is called Church of the Exaltation of St. Cross, but they are quite different. If you have time to visit only one of them, I recommend the first one since it was recently beautifully restored. The church has a very nice observation platform with a good view of the castle.             Litomysl Castle in Pardubice Region of Czech Republic was inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site in 1999. [CZECH TOURISM/LIBOR SVACEK]   The church also combines history with modern art. I want to mention the sacred light installation by the famous Czech glass artists Vaclav Cigler and Michal Motycka. The long prism is hanging from the ceiling in front of the altar and is constructed from cut, solid optical glass. During certain times of the day, the prism will emit an array of colors on the grey walls.  Another attraction of Litomysl is Portmoneum, a unique museum dedicated to exceptional artist Josef Vachal (1884-1969). Vachal was a writer, illustrator and printmaker who was a unique character with a rather enigmatic art style. The museum presents a sweepingly complex collection of imagery that is very difficult to interpret. All in all, Litomysl on a small scale offers everything the tourists visiting the Czech Republic are looking for. And I am happy and proud to promote it to Korean tourists.             The castle is originally a Renaissance arcade castle, a type first developed in Italy, that was adopted and developed further in central Europe in the 16th century, according to Unesco. Can you tell us some significant characteristics of such adaptations? The Litomysl Castle is an outstanding example of an arcaded Renaissance country residence, a type of structure first invented in Italy and then developed in the Czech lands. The main building of Litomysl castle, a four-winged structure from the outside, keeps its original style. The courtyard has three-story arcades at three sides, and on the northern wall are large sgraffiti depicting ancient and biblical scenes.  There are around 8,000 sgraffito bricks that fully cover its exterior and the castle strongly stands out amid its Baroque surroundings.            Sgraffito bricks of Litomysl Castle in Pardubice region of the Czech Republic. [CZECH TOURISM/LIBOR SVACEK]   Who were the residents of the castle? Thanks to historical documents, it is known that there had been a medieval castle on the site of Litomysl Castle. In the 16th century, Vratislav of Pernstejn acquired the castle and decided to rebuild it in the Renaissance style. The architects were Italians — Giovanni Battista Aostalli and Ulrico Aostalli. The castle was completed in 1581, after 13 years of construction. The Pernstejn family was one of the richest and most influential families in Czech medieval history. They were famous as soldiers, politicians and diplomats, but also as very successful entrepreneurs. They were very keen proponents of fish farming and their heritage is visible in the Czech landscape: It is said that every proper Czech settlement has a pond for fish farming. The aristocratic family of the Trauttmansdorffs, originally from Austria, acquired the castle in 1649. They redesigned some of the castle’s interiors in the Baroque style and the work was conducted by Franz Maxmilian Kanka. Luckily, the exterior of the castle remained original since it was considered representative enough and did not call for changes. In 1758, the Waldsteins became the new owners and they contributed to [building] the castle theater. The famous Czech composer Bedrich Smetana was born in the castle’s brewery in 1824. His father served as a brewer at the court of the Waldsteins. The Waldsteins have remained one of the most prominent noble families in Bohemia. Probably the most remembered and prominent member of the family was Albrecht von Waldstein, the supreme commander of the armies of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II and a major figure of the Thirty Years' War. Albrecht is not directly connected with Litomysl but represents the Waldstein family at the peak of their wealth. The last private owners of the castle were the Thurn-Taxis family. They did not live in the castle and owned it till the end of World War II. Nowadays, Litomysl Castle is owned by the Czech state. It can be said the noble families who owned the castle belonged to prestigious and important families in their time. The reasons why the castle changed hands had to do with financial difficulties or marriages.            Litomysl Castle in Pardubice region of the Czech Republic, which was inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site in 1999. [CZECH TOURISM/PAVEL VOPALKA]  Tell us about the efforts of authorities in the Czech Republic to preserve the castle. The responsibility for the property management is shared by the state through the National Heritage Institute and the City of Litomysl, which are responsible for the maintenance, protection and promotion of the property. The management is quite demanding and expensive because of the relatively vast number of castles – nearly 2,000 – and chateaus in the country. Many of them had to undergo thorough renovations since they had not been given proper care during the communist regime era, or had served purposes other than as tourist sites.            Gangsanseong Fortress in Gongju, South Chungcheong, is part of the Baekje Historic Areas inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site in 2015. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION]  Tell us about your experiences visiting Unesco Heritage sites in Korea. I visited several Unesco sites here in Korea already. The one I would like to mention is Baekje Historic Area. And it is for similar reasons why I chose Litomysl. For me it is a complex area, which presents various historical monuments, but also introduces to the visitor the whole historical era.  In the Baekje Historic Area, I visited Gongju of South Chungcheong, the capital city in Ungjin Period, where I saw the Gongsanseong Fortress and the Royal Tombs in Songsan-ri. At the fortress, apart from the beautiful walk by the walls and inside the fortress, I learned about the “falling butterflies,” who were in fact ladies from the court of the Baekje King, wearing colorful dresses, who jumped into the river from the rock in the fortress to prevent themselves from being captured by attackers of the fortress. I also visited Buyeo County, the capital city in the Sabi Period. When Czechs ask me about which special places to visit in Korea for cultural and historical experiences, I recommend Baekje to see cultural monuments and also to learn about the Baekje Kingdom. And learning by exploring the place is much more interesting and fun than just reading a book.             Czech Republic in brief    • Capital city:  Prague       • Area: 78,867 square kilometers (80 percent of the size of South Korea)     • Population: 10.7 million (2020)       • Main language: Czech       • Ethnic groups: Czech, Moravian, Slovak and other        • Religions: Roman Catholic, Protestant and other        • National day: Oct. 28, Czechoslovak Independence Day       • Government type: Parliamentary republic     • Currency: Czech koruna               Travel tips    • Best time to visit: The castle is closed during winter. Due to the Covid-19 situation, check litomysl.cz for updates.     • Recommended tours: Take the tour that includes a visit to the castle theater and gets you a closer look at the exterior design of the castle.      • Recommended accommodation: The ambassador recommends hotel Aplaus, a renovated medieval house right between the castle and historical center of the city and within walking distance to the whole Litomysl. “The stay there can be very romantic, and also culinary,” he says.      • What to eat: Local beers and local East Bohemian cuisine. The region is famous for honey and potatoes, so try food based on these ingredients such as gingerbread from the Pardubice region or potato dumplings with various fillings.     • Books to read before the trip: Books by Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, Karel Capek, including “R.U.R.,” and Bohumil Hrabal, including “I Served the King of England,” “Closely Observed Trains” and “Too Loud a Solitude.”     • Movies to watch: “Cosy Dens,” “Pupendo” or “The Wonderful Years that Sucked"" — just a few of famous Czech comedies — or films by Milos Forman, Vera Chytilova, Jiri Menzel or Juraj Herz.     • Music to listen to: Classical music by Antonin Dvorak, Bedrich Smetana, Leos Janacek and Bohuslav Martinu.             BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         Related Article[Into the heart of the country] The Dutch influence on Seoul's cityscape [Into the Heart of the Country] A visit to the 'devil's throat' is not as scary as it sounds[INTO THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY] Falling in love in a fortress by the sea      "

556,Level '2.5' restrictions could be lifted in greater Seoul next week,"

     A playground in Gangdong District, eastern Seoul, is closed Wednesday, after a cluster of coronavirus infections was traced to at a call center nearby. [YONHAP]         Health authorities said Wednesday if daily new coronavirus cases remain steady through the rest of this week, the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi could be lifted as planned on Sunday midnight.           If those measures are lifted, it would mean coffee shops, bars and restaurants could go back to allowing customers to eat and drink within their establishments after 9 p.m. Greater Seoul, however, would remain under Level 2 within the three-tier social distancing rules until Sept. 20, along with the rest of the country.           Wednesday’s optimistic announcement from the Central Disaster Management Headquarters came a few hours after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) announced that 156 new Covid-19 patients were detected nationwide on Tuesday, up from 136 the day before.             It was the seventh day in a row that Korea’s daily new cases stayed below 200.           “We’re definitely seeing fewer patients, and daily cases have dipped to the stable range of between 100 and 200,” Sohn Young-rae, an official at the headquarters, said in a Wednesday press briefing.           If the public maintains its focus on social distancing through the weekend, he suggested that a more subdued outbreak could allow the government to let the Level 2.5 measures to expire.         A final decision on the Level 2.5 measures will be made in the coming days, Sohn said, a call that would hinge on the virus situation in the Seoul metropolitan area and the rest of the country.             In the same breath, he warned people not to crowd riverside areas and parks, and urged members of the public to stay home during the upcoming Chuseok holidays, stressing that not visiting their relatives at all was a way to practice “filial piety” this year.                              Out of 156 people diagnosed with the coronavirus Tuesday, 144 were locally infected, while the rest were infected abroad, the KCDC said.           Among the local infections, 51 were in Gyeonggi, 48 in Seoul, 17 in Gwangju, eight in Daejeon, five in South Chungcheong, four in Ulsan, two each in Busan, Daegu and Sejong City and one each in Incheon, North Chungcheong, North Jeolla, South Jeolla and South Gyeongsang.           Of the imported cases, four were from Russia, three from the United States, two from Uzbekistan and one each from Qatar, Ukraine and Algeria.           Three people died Tuesday, bringing total deaths to 344, while 387 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 17,023.             By Tuesday at midnight, Korea had counted 21,588 coronavirus patients in all.           Korea’s latest outbreak was primarily caused by two clusters last month, one that emanated from the Sarang Jeil Church in Seongbuk District, central Seoul, and another from an antigovernment rally held on Korea’s Aug. 15 Liberation Day in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul.             Several right-wing groups have announced plans to hold a series of anti-Moon Jae-in rallies on Oct. 3 Foundation Day in downtown Seoul despite disapproval from the government.

558,Former sergeant willing to testify that Choo sought favor for son,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae.  [YONHAP]                The whistle-blower who made the initial accusation that Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae’s son received preferential treatment during his military service said he is willing to testify at the National Assembly.           Choo’s son, whose surname is Seo, served in the Korean Augmentation to The United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018. Suspicion has grown that Choo had abused her power to seek favor for her son while she was chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), although both of them have denied the allegations.           The scandal started earlier this year, when opposition lawmakers said Seo had been let off the hook when he went AWOL in June 2017. After the lawmakers filed a criminal complaint in January, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office started a probe, but no progress has been announced.             As the investigation appeared to be dragging on, whistle-blowers began talking to the media about special treatment Seo had allegedly received. Former members of Seo’s unit said Choo’s aide had telephoned the military to request an extension when Seo failed to return to duty at the end of a medical leave.            “Seo is lying because he trusts his mother’s power,” one of the whistle-blowers was quoted as saying by Rep. Yoon Han-hong of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), who provided the information to the JoongAng Ilbo. That whistle-blower was identified as a former sergeant who was in charge of roll call on the day when Seo failed to return to his base.           “If the National Assembly says I should testify, I will go and testify,” he was quoted as saying. “I am worried that there is an attempt to cover up or bury the evidence.”           Seo took his first medical leave from June 5 to 14, 2017, for knee surgery. He extended it to June 23, but did not return to the base. He used four additional personal days after the extension.             The former sergeant has told media, including the JoongAng Ilbo, that he had telephoned Seo and told him to return to the base at the end of his medical leave, but Seo failed to do so. He also said a captain, who was not a member of the Katusa unit, later appeared and ordered him to mark that Seo was using his personal vacation days.             “I did talk to Seo on the phone,” he said. “I was in charge of roll call on June 25. [Katusa soldiers] don’t do roll call on Fridays and Saturdays, so we realized he was missing on Sunday [June 25].”             Seo’s lawyers recently denied that Seo had ever talked to that sergeant on the phone. They said Seo had already extended his leave by using personal days from June 24 to 27 and that there was no need for him to talk to anyone in charge of roll call.           “Everything the whistle-blower says is a lie,” the lawyers said in a statement on Sept. 2, 2020.             The former sergeant said he was already questioned by the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office in June. “The prosecutors asked me if I had any evidence [that I had called Seo],” he said. “I told them that it is the prosecution’s job to search the communication records.”           “If you look into the records of telephone calls made from the base or Seo’s mobile phone record, you can confirm my account,” he said.           The whistle-blower said he had given prosecutors sufficient evidence to prove his location on June 25, 2017, including a GPS mark from a social network service that he was in the base in Uijeongbu, northern Gyeonggi.             He also submitted messages he had exchanged with other fellow soldiers through social media. According to the messages, shared by Rep. Yoon, he wrote after 9 p.m. on June 25, 2017 that Seo had taken a “fake medical leave to reschedule his return from Friday to the next Wednesday.”           He also wrote, “I wish Choo Mi-ae was my mother.”             Rep. Yoon vouched for the former sergeant's integrity.           “We will make sure this issue will be scrutinized at the upcoming hearing of the National Assembly,” he said.             Meanwhile, a new allegation has emerged that Choo’s aide had asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help her daughter to obtain a student visa to study in France in 2017, also when she was the party chairwoman.             “We are looking into the matter,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Kim In-chul on Tuesday. “If the request was made directly to the Foreign Ministry, it would have been easier to find out what had happened. But it seems that officials dispatched to the National Assembly and diplomats at the Korean Embassy in France could be involved, so we are checking on various issues.”             Choo allegedly requested a Foreign Ministry official dispatched to the National Assembly around August or September 2017 for help. The aide reportedly said the date of Choo’s daughter’s entrance to a university in France was approaching quickly, and that her student visa needed to be expedited.             Although the ministry official has denied giving any special favor, an official with knowledge of the situation told the JoongAng Ilbo that the ministry official had relayed the request to the Korean Embassy in Paris and the French Embassy in Seoul.           A source close to the administration said the aide must have done so without Choo’s order.           “The aide served Choo for a long time and was close to the family,” the source said. “The aide must have acted independently to help the daughter.”             Choo was a member of the Foreign and Unification Affairs Committee of the National Assembly in 2017. Because the committee oversees the Foreign Ministry, she could be criminally charged for abusing her power and making an improper request.           Choo’s lawyer denied the allegation.           “Getting a visa [of another country] cannot be done by making a request to our Foreign Ministry,” the lawyer said.             BY SER MYO-JA, LEE YU-JUNG    [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]         "

563,"Vigilante website for sex offenders shut down, probed","






     A screen capture of the website Digital Prison, which disclosed personal information of accused sex offenders. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               A website run by internet vigilantes is under investigation for going after alleged sex offenders, which led to the suicide of a university student in July.           The Daegu police said Wednesday they filed an assistance request with Interpol to apprehend and extradite the operators of the controversial website, known as Digital Prison.           As of Tuesday afternoon, the website was no longer accessible to the public, presumably shut down by its operators after police last week announced they had identified the vigilantes, who were residing in an undisclosed foreign country.           Created in June in the aftermath of the infamous “Nth room” digital pornography bust, Digital Prison was — according to one of its operators — a citizen’s answer to Korea’s criminal justice system and its oft-criticized tendency to dole out light sentences to serious offenders.           It listed — or ""doxxed,"" in internet lingo — private information on dozens of people it claimed were sex offenders, murderers and other potential felons, including their pictures, ages, addresses and phone numbers, as well as details about the allegations they faced.               Perhaps the most prominent figure exposed by the vigilante website was Son Jong-woo, the convicted operator of Welcome to Video — formerly the world’s largest child pornography website by amount of content.           Son was controversially released after serving a mere 18-month sentence in July after a Korean court turned down an extradition request by the United States. The ruling generated immense public criticism of authorities’ ineffective attempts to clamp down on digital sex crimes.           It was with such a backdrop that Digital Prison emerged as an outlet for ordinary Koreans to vent their frustrations at a perceived lack of justice. Before it went offline, the site on average had around 20,000 daily visitors, who were allowed to leave comments on individual pages of the accused.           One of its top operators, going by the online alias Pedro, told the JoongAng Ilbo in July that the purpose of the website was to grant the public the ability to properly punish sex offenders — since the government was not going to.             Such practices are potentially illegal and have engendered intense debate on how far individual citizens should be allowed to seek justice on their own.             There have already been several prominent cases in which Digital Prison has leveled false accusations at people.             Professor Chae Jung-ho, who teaches psychiatry at the Catholic University of Korea’s College of Medicine, was one such victim.             In June, Digital Prison put his information and picture on its website, accusing Chae of having attempted to purchase a video depicting illegal sex trafficking. A screen capture of a conversation on a messenger app was uploaded to the website as evidence of this attempted purchase.             Chae said he was bombarded with hate messages and threats after his personal information was listed on the website, while a petition even appeared on the Blue House website calling for his punishment.             Dumbfounded by the turn of events, and disbelieved by even his close friends and family members, Chae resorted to asking the police to investigate himself, turning over all data he had available.             After two weeks of thorough digital forensic analysis of over 99,000 text messages and 54,000 individual internet records, police concluded in late July that the professor had no connection to the alleged crime in question, and that the photograph allegedly depicting his solicitation of the video had been doctored or came from a different person.             But while Chae was somewhat vindicated through the investigation, many others attacked by the website have found no recourse to plead their cases.             On July 3, a 20-year-old Korea University student committed suicide after his personal information, including phone number and academic information, were posted on Digital Prison.           The website claimed the student had shared a doctored photograph of his colleague photoshopped on a pornographic image, an allegation the student denied in a post on an online university forum before he took his own life.             The death prompted demands by users of Korea University’s online forum for Digital Prison to be shut down. The website’s operators fought back, claiming it had offered the student the chance to take his information down if he submitted proof of his innocence.             Completely unregulated but for the whims of its operators, Digital Prison has been linked to at least two confirmed instances in which it doxxed people for sex offenses, but later admitted they had accused the wrong people with identical sounding names.             Such acts have apparently convinced the government it can no longer stand by as such vigilantism spirals out of its control.           Han Sang-huk, chairman of Korea Communications Commission, the country’s media watchdog, in a parliamentary hearing Tuesday vowed to impose criminal penalties on the website, saying the actions by Digital Prison constituted defamation.           “This is something that cannot happen in a civilized society,” he said.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
564,"Chip, display makers expected to stop sales to Huawei next week","

                   Major chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK hynix and display manufacturers including Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to stop supplying memory chips and panels to Huawei as toughened U.S. sanctions against the Chinese electronics company come into effect next week.             The companies will stop supplying Huawei from Sept. 15, the day the new trade restrictions are due to be implemented, according to sources in the industries and local media reports.           Samsung and SK hynix have both filed requests with the U.S. Commerce Department to continue sales to Huawei, according to local media reports on Wednesday.            The move came after the U.S. government issued a fresh sanction last month forbidding all chip producers from supplying the Chinese tech company with any chips based on U.S. technology, adding to previous sanctions banning them from manufacturing chips designed by Huawei or its affiliates.           The U.S. Commerce Department also put display driver integrated circuits on the banned product list, prompting display makers to cut sales of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels used for Huawei’s smartphones.           Both Samsung Display and LG Display supply OLED screens to Huawei.           The semiconductor and display makers declined to confirm the news, saying that they are not allowed to reveal contract details.           Still, industry sources with knowledge of the matter said the suspension of sales will go ahead.           “Samsung Electronics and SK hynix will suspend shipments to Huawei since they can be subject to the new rule,” said a source in the semiconductor industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.           The two companies are believed to use American equipment and software produced by the likes of Applied Materials and Lam Research to fabricate chips.           Local media outlets estimate sales to Huawei to be worth around 6.35 trillion won ($5.39 billion) for Samsung and 1.5 trillion won for SK hynix, which is about 10 percent of their entire revenue, according to the source.           Supplied chips include Low Power DDR4, a mobile dynamic random-access memory chip, embedded multi-media controller, a type of flash storage, and display driver integrated circuit, a microchip used for panel screens.           Another source in the display industry said that the proportion of sales coming from Huawei is insubstantial for display makers.           “Huawei secures most panels from Chinese manufacturer BOE,” the source said. “Huawei’s influence is not that great with local display manufacturers, and sales from Chinese companies account for less than 1 percent for LG Display.”           BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

     President Moon Jae-in, third from left, and Democratic Party leader Lee Nak-yon, seond from right, hold a meeting at the Blue House on Wednesday. [YONHAP]               Most Koreans will be receiving 20,000 won ($17) a month in support of their smartphone bills, according to a plan agreed upon by the ruling Democratic Party.             It also decided to extend a tax break to landlords that lower rents.           These agreements were made during a meeting between President Moon Jae-in and the new leadership of the Democratic Party on Wednesday, including Lee Nak-yon, the first Prime Minister of the current administration and the new party chief.             According to the Democratic Party, party leader Lee suggested including the 20,000-won subsidy for smartphone bills in the fourth supplementary budget to ease the burden on people who have been devastated by the coronavirus crisis.             Party spokesperson Choi In-ho said party leader Lee told President Moon that while the amount is small, offering support for telecommunications bills will provide comfort to people who are exhausted by the crisis.             President Moon reportedly agreed, adding that telecommunication bills have increased as most people are more engaged in non-contact activities due to the social distancing.             According to the Democratic Party, the government has accepted the request of the party to make a final decision after reviewing the issue.           There were early reports that those aged between 35 to 49 were to be excluded as they are relatively better off, but it was decided that anyone above the age of 17 will qualify.             The ruling party also said the Blue House and the leadership of the party have also discussed extending tax breaks given to landlords lowering rent.             Party floor leader Kim Tae-nyeon made the request.           The government earlier this year provided a 50 percent tax credit on the amount that the landlord lowered on small businesses' rents. However, the tax credit only applied cuts made by the end of June.           The ruling party and the government may be mulling an extension of the tax credit until the end of the year.           ""Floor leader Kim suggested extending the tax credit to landlords will help in creating an environment of people helping each other in times of crisis,” spokesman Cho said.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

567,Embattled Travelholic CEO dies in hospital,"

     The empty office of the popular Korean travel contents company Travelholic in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, which has been mired in controversy after illegal porn was uploaded to its Instagram account late last month. The CEO of Travelholic, Jo Jun-ki, was confirmed dead by police Wednesday. [NEWS1]               Jo Jun-ki, the CEO of popular Korean travel content company Travelholic, who came under fire for allegedly posting illegal porn on social media, was confirmed dead by police Wednesday.           Jo, 31, had been hospitalized in Seoul in critical condition for the past week after an apparent suicide attempt on Sept. 1. His cause of death remains under investigation by police.           A police official didn’t rule out the possibility that Jo may have made another suicide attempt at the hospital.               The young entrepreneur’s Travelholic platform, which introduces tourist destinations in Korea and around the globe, had some 1.2 million followers on Instagram and more than 410,000 subscribers on YouTube.             However, Jo drew fierce public backlash after apparently accidentally sharing a pornographic clip on Aug. 29, mixed into travel photographs on Travelholic's official Instagram account. His followers were quick to point out that the clip appeared to be an illegal molka, or hidden camera footage, taken without the woman's knowledge.           Travelholic quickly took down the post meant to introduce Daegwallyeong Sheep Ranch in Pyeongchang, Gangwon, and issued a series of apologies, which drew further criticism for a perceived lack of sincerity.             The Seoul Gangnam Police Precinct on Aug. 30 launched an internal investigation into Travelholic on whether to press charges over allegations that the footage had been illegally filmed.             The final official apology post shared on the Travelholic Instagram account on Aug. 30 stated that the clip had been downloaded by an unspecified person while surfing the net. The company acknowledged the gravity of the issue, saying it plans to reinforce sex education and halt activities until the issue is resolved.             On social media, Jo eventually acknowledged that he had downloaded the porn clip himself and denied that he had personally filmed it.             On Sept. 1, he posted an apparent suicide note on his personal Instagram page, apologizing to everybody and indicating his plans to “depart on my own path.” He went on to outline his funeral arrangements and also asked people to send condolence payments to his personal bank account number, included in the post, to help support his family and company employees.             An acquaintance of Jo contacted police minutes after Jo’s apparent suicide attempt.             Jo was found unconscious at around 11 a.m. in an undisclosed location in Itaewon in Yongsan District, central Seoul, by emergency responders who revived him through cardiopulmonary resuscitation.             He was transported to a nearby hospital and had been receiving treatment for the past eight days.             Gangnam police are expected to close the investigation into Jo.             Possession of illegal porn can result in up to three years in prison or a fine of 30 million won ($25,000), while distribution of illegal pornography can result in a maximum of seven years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won.           Jo’s wake will be held Friday at the Soonchunhyang University Hospital Seoul.             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         If you or someone you know are feeling emotionally distressed or struggling with thoughts of suicide, LifeLine Korea can be contacted at 1588-9191.

568,DP rep. accused of trying to bully internet portal,"

     Rep. Yoon Young-chan of the Democratic Party is photographed sending a text message to an aide during a National Assembly session on Tuesday. [NEWS1]      Ruling party Chairman Lee Nak-yon rebuked a former presidential aide-turned-lawmaker for having tried to browbeat an internet news service after it highlighted an opposition leader’s speech.       “Yesterday, one of our lawmakers was caught sending an inappropriate text message about an internet portal during a National Assembly session,” Lee said during a leadership meeting of the Democratic Party (DP) in the morning.     “[Rep. Yoon Young-chan] said he wanted to complain to the portal because it did not carry fair coverage of the DP chairman’s speech and an opposition leader’s speech. Still, I believe his action can trigger misunderstanding.”       On Tuesday, photojournalists accredited to the National Assembly took photos of Rep. Yoon while he was sending a text message to someone. Photos of Yoon’s mobile phone screen showed that he had sent a captured image from the Daum portal of a speech by Rep. Joo Ho-young of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP) to an aide.          Joo gave the speech around 2 p.m. Tuesday at the National Assembly. DP Chairman Lee gave his speech on the previous day.     The aide responded to Yoon that “Joo Ho-young’s speech is posted immediately on the main page.”     “You must lodge a strong complaint to Kakao [the owner of Daum],"" Yoon wrote to the aide. “Kakao is being unreasonable. Tell them to come to my office.”       Yoon was a former senior secretary for public affairs in the Moon Blue House. He was a Dong-A Ilbo journalist from 1990 till 2007 and an executive of Naver, another major internet portal, from 2008 until he joined the Moon Blue House in 2017. He left the presidential office in January 2019 to run in the April general elections.     He won his race in Jungwon District of Seongnam, Gyeonggi, and is a member of the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee.       At a meeting of the committee later Tuesday, Yoon said he wanted to complain about the unfairness of Daum’s news selection. “When DP Chairman Lee gave his speech, I also monitored Kakao, and it was not on the main page,” Yoon said. “But as soon as Joo started his speech, reports were displayed on the main page, so I expressed my skepticism about its fairness.       “I asked my aide why the two speeches were covered differently,” he continued. “It is regretful that this issue is politicized. I think I have freedom to tell [Kakao] my opinion.”       Kakao said artificial intelligence programs, not its staff, are in charge of selecting and displaying news reports on the main page.            Rep. Yoon Young-chan of the Democratic Party. [NEWS1]  The opposition PPP fiercely attacked Yoon for trying to gag the internet portal. “This is a politics of fear that undermines freedom of the press,” Rep. Kim Eun-hye, spokeswoman of the PPP, said.     Rep. Kim Gi-hyeon said Yoon deserves a criminal probe because he is a member of the committee that directly oversees technology and internet industry.       “He should be charged with abuse of power and coercion,” Kim said. “We must take strong legal action against Yoon. He should also be judged by the Ethics Committee of the National Assembly.”       Opposition lawmakers on the Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee held a press conference Wednesday demanding Yoon resign from the committee and give up his lawmaker seat. They also demanded a parliamentary investigation into any possible attempts by the Moon administration to gag the press, raising the suspicion that Yoon pressured news companies when he was working for the Blue House.       Other PPP members said there was a precedent from the Park Geun-hye Blue House in which an aide was convicted of contacting a broadcaster to complain about its reports.       In January, the Supreme Court convicted former lawmaker Lee Jung-hyun of having intervened in the news-making process of KBS, the national public broadcaster.     When he was serving as senior presidential secretary for public affairs for Park, he telephoned KBS to complain about a report that the Coast Guard did not make timely efforts to evacuate the Sewol Ferry when it sank in April 2014. He also tried to intervene in the editorial direction of the broadcaster’s news program later that month, the court ruled. The Supreme Court convicted Lee of violating the Broadcasting Act by infringing upon the broadcaster's editorial independence and fined him 10 million won ($8,400). It was the first conviction of a political figure for intervening in a broadcaster's news judgement.      Another PPP lawmaker, Park Dae-chul, said he proposed a bill on Wednesday to revise the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, also known as the Kim Young-ran Act, to stop any attempt at influencing internet news service providers.       Park proposed that staff of internet news service providers such as Naver and Kakao should be governed by the antigraft act. The law currently covers public servants, workers in public institutions and journalists. Park said the portals must be treated as media companies.     “A precedent by the Supreme Court said an internet news service provider’s news service is essentially an activity of the press,” Park said. “Over 80 percent of news reports are consumed through portals operated by internet news providers, but they were left out of the law.”       Meanwhile, Yoon issued an apology on Wednesday afternoon. ""It was my fault,"" Yoon wrote in a Facebook post. ""I accept all criticism.""      BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]  "

571,Top Koreans assemble for the LPGA Tour's second major,"

     From left: Park Sung-hyun, Kim Sei-young and Park In-bee [GETTY IMAGES/YONHAP]               The long awaited ANA Inspiration, the second major tournament on the LPGA Tour, will finally tee off at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, on Thursday.           The ANA Inspiration is one of five major tournaments on the LPGA Tour and is usually the first one held every season. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the tournament has been delayed to September, rather than April. That makes the ANA Inspiration the second major tournament this year, after the AIG Women’s Open, held from August 20 to 23.            The 49th edition of the tournament will feature a total of 105 players vying for the tournament purse of $3.1 million. Along with the prize money, the champion will be given 625 Race to the CME Globe points. Due to Covid-19, the tournament will be played on an empty course for all four days.            Although the LPGA Tour re-started their season a little over a month ago, this week’s major will still be missing a number of top Korean golfers, including current world No. 1 Ko Jin-young. Ko, along with 2019 rookie of the year Lee Jeong-eun and world No. 10 Kim Hyo-joo, among others, is expected to stay in Korea and play on the KLPGA Tour for the rest of the season.            Ko’s absence is doubly disappointing as she is both world No. 1 and the defending champion.            “Choosing to skip this year’s ANA was one of the most difficult decisions of my entire life,” Ko was quoted as saying on the LPGA Tour website. “Although I sadly will not be able to participate this year, I am encouraged by the successful tour restart and all the positive steps the LPGA is taking to make it as safe as possible.”           With the absence of Ko, world No. 4 Park Sung-hyun will enter this week’s major as the highest ranked Korean golfer. Park will be playing her very first LPGA Tour event this year. Park’s most recent appearance on the LPGA Tour was back at the CME Group Tour Championship in November 2019, where she withdrew on the final round.            “It’s really been a while since I’ve been on the LPGA Tour,” Park was quoted as saying. “I think I’m more nervous than excited to be back. It’s been a while since I’ve been in a competitive environment, and I’ve got to keep that in mind playing while the four rounds this week.”           During her absence on the LPGA Tour, Park competed in only one KLPGA Tour event, at the 42nd KLPGA Championship. Park didn’t live up to expectations and missed the cut, finishing the tournament at a shocking 118th.           Along with her poor performance in Korea, it has been a while since Park has picked up a trophy anywhere in the world.            Since her victory at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship in June 2019, Park hasn’t won anything. As she also didn’t compete in that many tournaments, she slipped down to fourth despite finishing 2017, 2018 and 2019 as world No. 2.            Park will play her first round along with Nasa Hataoka of Japan, starting at 1:18 p.m. on Thursday or at 5:18 a.m. on Friday morning in Korea.            Following Park, world No. 6 Kim Sei-young will continue her season on the LPGA Tour. Kim was one of the few active Korean players to continue her season on the KLPGA Tour while the LPGA Tour was halted earlier this season.            During the time, Kim competed in five KLPGA Tour events and managed to record top-five finishes in four of the tournaments. After about two months playing in Korea, Kim was one of the first Korean golfers to head back to the United States in August.            Kim skipped the AIG Women’s Open at Royal Troon Golf Club in Britain, making her return at the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship Presented by P&G. Kim finished the tournament tied for fifth.            Although Kim has only competed in three tournaments on the LPGA Tour this season, she had been very consistent on both the LPGA and the KLPGA. On the LPGA Tour, Kim recorded top-10 finishes in all three tournaments she competed in this season.            Kim will start her first round at 1:27 p.m., or 5:27 a.m. on Thursday in Korea, playing with Nelly Korda of the United States.            Along with the two, former world No. 1 and hall of famer Park In-bee will continue her season on the LPGA Tour. Having competed at the AIG Women’s Open, this will be Park's second major of the season.            Rather than heading to the United States, Park went straight from Korea to Britain. At the AIG Women’s Open, Park finished fourth, six shots behind the winner Sophia Popov of Germany. The ANA Inspiration will be Park's second tournament in the United States this season, after the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship at the end of August.         Park will play her first round with Brittany Lincicome of the United States, starting from the 10th hole at 8 a.m., or midnight in Korea.           A total of 12 Korean golfers will be competing at the ANA Inspiration this week.            BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
572,Korean Air starts flying passenger planes converted for cargo,"

                  Korean Air Lines said Wednesday it has begun to use two converted planes to transport cargo on routes to the United States in the latest move to offset a sharp decline in air travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.           The biggest carrier in Korea recently converted two B777-300ER jets into cargo planes after obtaining approval from the Transport Ministry.           ""One of the two converted aircraft flew to the Rickenbacker International Airport in Ohio on Tuesday, and the other is scheduled to fly to the same airport on Thursday,"" a company spokesman said.           The move is in line with global airlines, which are now using their passenger planes for cargo flights, either by using cargo seat bags or removing seats.           In June, Korean Air began to carry cargo in cargo seat bags, which attach to the seats of passenger jets, as the pandemic drove down travel demand and its earnings.           Cargo-carrying demand has jumped this year as more than 180 countries and territories closed their borders or imposed entry restrictions on incoming passengers amid virus fears.           Increased cargo demand helped airlines offset a sharp decline in air travel demand in the April-June quarter.           On a parent basis, Korean Air shifted to a net profit of 162.4 billion won ($137 million) in the second quarter from a net loss of 80.78 billion won a year earlier as it focused on obtaining more cargo-carrying orders.           Korean Air said it may consider making another request to the ministry to convert additional passenger jets into cargo planes if cargo demand continues to rise amid the Covid-19 pandemic.           The government will review the request if there is an additional request from the national flag carrier for plane conversion, a ministry official said, adding safety should be guaranteed by manufacturer Boeing for the conversion.           Korean Air has a fleet of 143 passenger jets, including 26 B777-300ERs and 23 cargo planes.           The carrier expects its overall cargo volumes will increase by at least 10 tons to 34 tons after the conversion.           Korean Air's low-cost affiliate Jin Air also plans to convert a B777-200ER jet into a cargo plane next month after obtaining government approval.           Asiana Airlines said it is considering the plane conversion plan as the pandemic shows no signs of slowing down.            Yonhap         "
573,Kim Jong-un focuses on storm damage to key mining area,"

     North Korean leader Kim Jong-un addresses officials during an enlarged meeting of the North's ruling Workers' Party Central Military Commission (CMC) on Tuesday, held to discuss measures to relieve the damage caused by Typhoon Maysak. [YONHAP]               North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened yet another impromptu meeting of Pyongyang’s top military officials to discuss mitigation of the damage caused by Typhoon Maysak to a key mining area earlier this month, state media reported.             According to the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, Kim presided over an enlarged Central Military Commission (CMC) meeting on Tuesday to address the devastation wrought by the storm on the Komdok area in South Hamgyong Province, which houses one of North Korea’s most important natural mineral mines.           North Korea is known to have one of the largest rare-earth mineral reserves in the world, and the Komdok mine is one of the country’s leading producers of lead and zinc. Nearby Taehung and Ryongyang mines, located in the Buktaechon Valley, are key producers of magnesium.           The sprawling mining complexes in the area were heavily damaged on Sept. 3 as a result of flooding and landslides due to Typhoon Maysak, the Rodong Sinmun reported.             Around 2,000 households — most of them miners and their families — were left homeless, while the storm also destroyed 59 bridges and almost 60 kilometers (37 miles) of roads, the report said. In addition, around 3,500 meters of railway roadbeds and 1,130 meters of railways were destroyed, “leading to a state of emergency of total paralysis of transport system,” the report said.           Kim, the report continued, stressed the storm's destruction has left the regime with no choice but to “change the direction of our struggle” and “comprehensively” reconsider scheduled projects for the rest of the year.           He then ordered that “state emergency measures” be taken to ensure homes and the road network in the area are restored by Thursday — and that “all damages are undone 100 percent by year-end.”           Such an order was a tall one for the cash-strapped regime, which is facing its biggest economic crisis since the mid-1990s amid Covid-19 and serial natural disasters like typhoons and the one of the longest rainy seasons on record this summer.             According to a 2019 report on the Taehung mine by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), the area had not yet even recovered fully from the damage caused by a 2012 storm, Typhoon Bolaven, as late as 2018.            Kim’s admission that changes to economic plans were inevitable is the second time in only five months the regime has been forced to revise its economic agenda for the year, following a similar decision due to the Covid-19 pandemic in April.             What those changes will entail is unclear. One possibility is that the regime may be scrapping or postponing its plans to complete the Pyongyang General Hospital by October, when the Workers’ Party celebrates its 75th anniversary.           To underscore the public's receptiveness to Kim’s call to action, state media this week reported that 300,000 party members in Pyongyang volunteered and left for North and South Hamgyong Provinces to assist in the reconstruction efforts.             Thousands of party members in the capital, organized into different divisions, boarded trains headed to Hamgyong on Wednesday as they were seen off by working people, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
574,Choose wisely this Chuseok as vegetable prices soar,"

                           A visitor to a supermarket in downtown Seoul looks at the options in the vegetable section on Sept. 7. [NEWS1]  With food prices skyrocketing, many Koreans are rethinking their Chuseok holiday choices.     ""I went to the market to buy ingredients for seasoned acorn jelly, but ended up just buying a cucumber,"" said a 34-year-old woman from Mapo District, western Seoul. ""One hundred and twenty grams of lettuce costs 4,380 won ($3.70), while a green pumpkin goes for 4,280 won. Two cucumbers cost 4,050 won, and a bunch of spinach is about 6,780 won. Does this make any sense?”       According to the woman, it costs about 50,000 won to 70,000 won to prepare a meal for her family these days. Kim said she'd rather just buy meal kits or salads instead.       Chuseok falls on Oct. 1 — the rainiest of rainy seasons — which has been punctuated by two typhoons and has left many wondering how they are going to afford the holiday.       According to data collected by Korea Price Information, traditional offerings for ancestors — which include a wide variety of fresh foods — cost about 270,500 won at a traditional market, up 16.5 percent from last year. At a supermarket, it would cost 404,730 won, a 24.7 percent jump.       ""The prices of chestnuts rose due to the reduced amount of imports amid Covid-19. Also, a lot of chestnuts fell to the ground because of the typhoons,” a spokesperson for Korea Price Information said. “This summer’s long downpour and scorching heat wave caused volatility in vegetable prices. The prices of beef, pork and rice also soared.”               According to the Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corporation, the price of Napa cabbage on Tuesday was about 9,738 won, a 99 percent increase compared to the same period a year earlier. The price increased 58 percent over the last month.       The price of radishes has jumped to 3,703 won, a 94 percent increase compared to a year before. The prices of watermelons, perilla leaves, chives and cherry tomatoes rose between 30 to 80 percent.     As prices rise, food companies, who were already suffering from a sharp drop in sales due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are scrambling to reduce the amount of vegetables in their dishes or replace them with cheaper ingredients.       Last weekend, a Chinese restaurant in Yeouido, western Seoul, received a complaint from a customer because its stir-fried vegetables had no bok choy.       ""I understand that restaurants are having hard time amid Covid-19,"" a customer said. ""However, Chinese-style stir-fried vegetables without bok choy? It doesn’t make any sense.”       Some local restaurants which sell jokbal (pig's trotters) or hoe (raw fish), have recently announced that they cannot serve lettuce for a while.       ""A box of lettuce costs about 90,000 won these days. It’s even more costly than pork,"" said one man who runs a restaurant.       Vegetables prices are likely to increase further until the Chuseok harvest festival.       The wholesale price of cabbage and lettuce on Sept. 7 increased 28.6 percent and 24.3 percent respectively compared to three days earlier. During the same period, the wholesale price of cucumbers and green pumpkins jumped by 25 to 35 percent.       Retail prices are likely to reflect the wholesale price changes in one or two weeks.       ""Supermarkets don't apply changing vegetable prices every day, but prices will inevitably rise in the near future,"" said a spokesperson for a local big supermarket.       BY BAE JUNG-WON, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]              Related ArticlePrices rise at fastest pace since pandemic began"
575,Campus businesses are early victims of pandemic,"

                           Sinchon in western Seoul, one of Seoul’s most vibrant university neighborhoods, is unusually empty and quiet on Sept. 7. [NEWS1]             It’s been about two weeks since the fall semester began, but university campuses are empty. While society concentrates on protecting students from contracting the coronavirus, there are victims who hesitate to draw attention to themselves: businesses in or near college campuses.     Mrs. Yoon, who owns a bar in front of Sungkyunkwan University, says she is worried about paying bills. Yoon’s bar barely has customers since the university canceled entrance ceremonies and put all lectures online.      “It’s no exaggeration to say that we saw a sales drop of nearly 100 percent,” Yoon said. “At the worst time, we didn't have a single customer for three days in a row. This is actually a way more serious problem than most people think.”     Yoon added, “I have to pay 10 million won ($8,400) every month in rent. I don't know how I'll pay the money. The building owner never wants to understand my situation.”      According to Yoon, many business owners near Sungkyunkwan University in Jongno District, central Seoul, are closing their stores as they can’t afford to keep going.      For businesses in or near Seoul's many university campuses, Covid-19 is a pandemic and an economic catastrophe. As the coronavirus started spreading in Korea in February, the government urged schools not to hold face-to-face classes. Korea's university students nationwide had to take online classes for the entire spring semester earlier this year.      “For us, the beginning and end of a semester are the time when sales reach their peak. Each department of the university holds large greeting and ending ceremonies every semester, as well as parties celebrating the end of final exams,” Yoon added. “Losing them is equal to losing all of our customers. I was forced to fire all my part-time workers as well.”      The depression is most evident in Sinchon, western Seoul, one of Seoul’s most vibrant university neighborhoods. It is the hub of three major universities — Yonsei University, Ewha Womans University and Sogang University — all in a 20-minute walk of each other.     “The number of students on campus constantly decreased since the outbreak of the coronavirus earlier in the year, and now, I barely see them,” said Mr. Park, who runs a cafe on the Ewha Womans University campus.      Park said his sales saw an 80 percent drop last month compared to the same period before the coronavirus paralyzed campuses.      “As a person who owns a cafe on campus, I have no other customers except for Ewha Womans University students,” he continued. “Business owners on campus of cafes and restaurants are all suffering a lot these days, and some have already left.”     Restaurants and cafes are not the only victims.      Mrs. Oh, who has been running a flower shop in front of Yonsei University for over 30 years, said she almost collapsed when she heard about the cancellation of the school’s graduation ceremony, which was supposed to be held in mid-August.                   A Yonsei University student dressed in gown and graduation cap stands on the campus in Seodaemun District, western Seoul, on Aug. 23. Amid concerns over the spread of the coronavirus, the school canceled its graduation ceremony and only allowed students to take pictures individually with their families. [NEWS1]   According to Oh, times have never been this dire.       “The entrance and graduation seasons of nearby universities, especially Yonsei University, are the major time when flowers are sold,” Oh said. “As there are no students and no events at all [due to the Covid-19], I can’t even pay the bills now.”      Oh added, “I sold a bunch of house plants for 3,000 won yesterday. Today, I didn't have a single customer the whole day. I’ve been owning this flower shop for over 30 years. What should I do? Should I close the shop like other stores in Sinchon?”     A lot of restaurants, bars and cafes are empty in Sinchon.      According to the Korea Appraisal Board, the average vacancy rate for commercial buildings in Sinchon in the second quarter of the year hit 10.5 percent, more than the average for Seoul, which was 7.9 percent.      The average vacancy rate for commercial buildings in front of Sookmyung Women's University in the second quarter was about 6.9 percent, a nearly 10-fold jump from the end of last year. During the same period, the vacancy rate for commercial buildings in front of Sungshin Women's University nearly doubled to reach 10 percent.      The vacancies are led by a “rising number of people who went out of business due to weak consumer sentiment and a sharp decline in sales caused by the Covid-19 outbreak,” according to a spokesperson for the Korea Appraisal Board.      “More and more people are trying to close their businesses at this time,” a real estate agent in front of Yonsei University said. “To be honest, more than 80 percent of all remaining businesses are currently up for sale. But, you know, who would want to buy one now?”     “My only prayer for the past few months was an end to the coronavirus and a return of students,” Oh added. “However, while the second wave of the virus attack escalates, universities are likely to put all lectures online again.”      Just five weeks ago, Korean universities were planned to hold small-sized lectures and face-to-face classes as daily Covid-19 infections had remained low. However, a second wave of the virus is forcing them to send students back home again.      Yonsei University recently said it will shift all lectures, as well as midterms, online until the end of October. Others such as Seoul National University and Sogang University will hold courses online for the first four weeks of the semester.      Hanyang University, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies and Konkuk University are also planning to hold all lectures online for the first two weeks of the semester, and they say the period can be extended if the virus keeps spreading.      University students who live in tiny one-room accommodations, or officetels, near their schools are in a panic as they have to pay monthly rent although they do not go to school at all.      “I feel like the situation is repeating again,” a 25-year-old Ewha Womans University student Yoo, who lives in an officetel near her school, said.      According to Yoo, all of her courses in the spring semester were held online. She had to pay monthly rent and additional bills without going to school a single time. Yoo recently signed another rental contract ahead of the fall semester.      “I would have just gone home to Gwangju [where my family lives] if I knew the courses would be held online. The fall semester just started, and I feel like it will be just like last semester. Do I have to waste all my money again?”      Park Beom-jin, a 23-year-old Hanyang University student, currently lives in a gosiwon — very small rooms rented out cheaply to students preparing for exams — near his school. According to him, as all courses of the last semester were entirely held via online, there was no point for him to stay at his gosiwon.      “I paid monthly rent, electricity and gas bills even though I didn't go to school a single time,” Park said. “Eating also cost me. It is such a waste of money.”     A shortage of job opportunities is another unexpected problem. College students who need part-time jobs can’t find any.      Lee Joo-yeon, a 24-year-old Hanyang University student, says she's trying but having little luck.     “When I had a job interview with a cafe owner, he said he was looking for an experienced worker,” Lee said. “According to him, he used to have two part-time workers but had to cut one as he can’t afford paying them amid the Covid-19 pandemic.”     Mr. Lee, a 28-year-old studying for the civil service exam, said he was recently laid off from his part-time job.     “While studying for the exam, I used to work at a pub in front of Hanyang University at night to earn money for monthly living expenses,” Lee said. “After I lost the job, it’s been really tough for me to get another opportunity.”      According to a survey of 749 university students conducted between June 16 to 23 by job search app Albacall, which is operated by Incruit, 90.5 percent said they find it extremely difficult finding part-time jobs. In this group, 55 percent singled out “a shortage of job opportunities after the Covid-19 outbreak” as the reason.      Some 183,000 part-time workers were laid off in May alone, according to data by Statistics Korea. The economically inactive population reached 16.54 million as of May, rising by 555,000 compared to the same month a year earlier.     BY CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]  "
576,Jobs shrink for sixth consecutive month,"

     Job applicants do interviews online at IBK Finance Tower in central Seoul on Aug. 26 during a financial industry job fair. [YONHAP]               The number of people with jobs shrunk for the sixth consecutive month, with 274,000 jobs lost in August compared to a year earlier.           Covid-19 was only one factor. Korea's longest rainy season on record was another.           September figures could be worse as the effect of stricter social distancing regulations due to the resurgence of Covid-19 is felt, along with two typhoons that hit the Peninsula back-to-back.             According to Statistics Korea on Wednesday, 27.08 million people had jobs in August, a decline of 274,000 compared to a year ago.           It has been Korea's longest stretch of job losses in more than a decade.             The longest record of consecutive monthly job losses was in 2009, when the total number of people employed shrunk for eight consecutive months between January and August.             “As in July, August was affected by Covid-19 and the long heavy rainy season,” said Chung Dong-wook, Statistics Korea’s director of employment statistics.             Services were hit hardest.             The wholesales and retail sector saw 176,000 lost jobs, while lodgings and restaurants lost 169,000. The education industry saw the number of people employed shrink 89,000.             Manufacturing saw 50,000 people losing their jobs.             Agriculture and fisheries saw 3,000 fewer people employed, largely due to the heavy rains.             Areas that saw increases in jobs included health and social welfare, which includes government jobs given to senior citizens. The health and social welfare sector saw 160,000 new hires.             The logistics and storage industry saw 56,000 more hires, largely thanks to the social distancing regulations that boosted online shopping and deliveries.           By age group, the only bracket that saw positive growth were people 60 years old or older.             That bracket gained 384,000 jobs in August.           For workers between the ages of 15 and 29, some 172,000 were lost. For workers in their 30s, some 23,000 jobs vanished. Workers in their 40s lost 182,000 jobs; in their 50s, 74,000.           The latest statistics showed that the impact of the virus and rainy season was hardest on those with less job security.           The number of employees hired on contracts when compared to a year ago was 318,000 fewer, while jobs for day-workers shrunk by 78,000.             However, in the category of salaried workers, there was an increase of 282,000.           The number of workers taking temporary breaks increased 143,000 from a year ago to total 846,000.             Self-employed businesses were also hit hard by the ongoing pandemic.             Self-employed businesses with employees saw jobs shrink 172,000. Self-employed businesses without employees saw jobs grow by 66,000 when compared to a year ago, indicating that many businesses are letting employees go.             Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki raised concerns about September’s job report.             “The job indexes that were reported today were the results of the job situation before social distancing measures were raised in the greater Seoul area,” Hong said on Facebook.           “My heart is already heavy with the thought of the additional impact [of the toughened measures],” Hong said. “We will submit a fourth supplementary budget within this week at the National Assembly that is strongly centered on the vulnerable class and those that are affected the most.”           The government and ruling Democratic Party on Sunday agreed on a 7-trillion-won ($5.9-billion) supplementary budget. So far this year, the government has created three supplementary budgets amounting to a total of 59 trillion won.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

He was safe at the plate as he got around catcher Luis Torrens' tag, but jammed his right hand into the ground on the play. He stayed on the ground and grabbed the wrist immediately in obvious pain.           Texas manager Chris Woodward said afterward X-rays came back negative, showing no structural damage.           ""Fortunately, they didn't find a break, which I was a little worried about,"" Woodward said.          The loss was the Rangers' sixth straight.           Choo, 38, is in the final year of his seven-year, $130-million deal with the Rangers. He was involved in some trade speculation prior to the Aug. 31 deadline.           He's batting only 0.229/0.317/0.394 this year in 32 games, with five home runs and 15 RBIs. He has also ceded his leadoff spot so that the team can develop younger players there.           Despite declining production, Choo has said he could play for another year or two, and Woodward said he appreciates what Choo can provide on and off the field.           ""He's a really good example to show our younger guys, the at-bat quality on a daily basis and how to prepare,"" Woodward said.

581,Philip Morris rallies against gov't treatment of e-cigarettes,"

     Phillip Morris Korea Managing Director Paik Young-jay speaks during an online press event held Wednesday. [PHILIP MORRIS KOREA]                Philip Morris Korea Managing Director Paik Young-jay stressed that the company’s electronic heat-not-burn device is fundamentally different from conventional cigarettes, citing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) recent approval for IQOS to be marketed as a modified-risk tobacco product.           During an online press event held Wednesday, Paik said the company’s IQOS heat-not-burn tobacco system is “fundamentally different from conventional cigarettes, and, therefore, it is inappropriate to apply the same regulations.           “Stronger regulations need to be enforced on worse products.”           In July, the FDA authorized Philip Morris International (PMI) to market IQOS as a modified-risk tobacco product. This enables PMI to say that the IQOS system, which heats tobacco but does not burn it, significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals.             The authorization also allows PMI to say that scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the heat-not-burn system significantly reduces the body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.          “Korean smokers that smoke conventional cigarettes have the right to learn of a replacement that has been scientifically proven to be better,” said Paik. “Instead of approaching e-cigarettes ideologically, transparent discussion based on evidence needs to take place [to ease regulations].”             There are more than 8 million cigarette smokers in Korea.           “If accurate information isn’t delivered to adult smokers, and if the relevant legislation does not encourage a better replacement, they will continue to smoke conventional cigarettes, damaging their health and causing a major social loss,” Paik said.           Paik also suggested the need to ease taxes on e-cigarettes to encourage more smokers to use e-cigarettes.           Paik's statement came in response to the Health Ministry's announcement last month on its plan to double the national health promotion tax on e-liquids for electronic cigarettes from 525 won ($0.44) per 1 milliliter of nicotine solution to 1,050 won starting in January next year.            Promoting e-cigarettes is part of the company’s vision to achieve a smoke-free future.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]               Related ArticleAnti-smoking policiesCigarette maker dreams of a smoke-free future"

586,Loans to households jump by a record amount in August,"

     Customers consult with bank clerks on borrowing loans at a Hana Bank in Seoul. [NEWS1]               Loans to households increased by a record amount in August, led by borrowings for investments in property and shares.           According to Bank of Korea and Financial Services Commission (FSC) data released Wednesday, loans taken out by households from commercial banks increased by 11.8 trillion won ($9.9 billion) in August, bringing the total outstanding to 948.2 trillion.           It is the biggest monthly increase since the institutions began compiling related statistics in 2004.             When all financial institutions — which would also include savings banks and credit card companies — are included, new borrowings by households last month reached 14.0 trillion won.                              By loan type, 6.1 trillion won was borrowed for housing, a nearly 33 percent year-on-year jump. Of that, loans for jeonse, or long-term rent deposits, totaled 3.4 trillion won.           ""There were more jeonse trades last month,"" said Yoon Ok-ja, an official from the central bank.           ""An overall increase in jeonse prices had an effect. The price increase pushed the increase in jeonse loans from 2.7 trillion won in July to 3.4 trillion won by the end of August.""           Unsecured loans hit 5.7 trillion won in the month of August. This was largely due to low interest rates and a recent increase in money borrowed by individual investors buying into the initial public offerings, such as the IPO of Kakao Games, the FSC said.           The commission also suspected some of the unsecured lending went toward property purchases, as mortgage lending has been held back by government policy, adding it will inspect banks to determine whether unsecured loans were issued according to the rules.             ""The FSC will take a closer look to see if the recent increase in household loans is a temporary phenomenon or an actual trend in the economy. After thorough inspection, we will come up with an action plan to manage the increasing debt,"" said the FSC.             In August, corporate lending declined. A total of 5.9 trillion won was borrowed by companies last month, compared to 8.4 trillion won the month before.             While loans to large companies decreased by 0.1 trillion won last month, it was largely offset by the 6.1 trillion won increase in loans to smaller companies.           ""Big companies are in less urgent need for liquidity, but the demand for loans is steadily increasing among smaller businesses and the self employed. Financial support from public institutions also contributed to the increase,"" explained the central bank.             BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
587,Credit limits for online classes are now up to the universities,"

     Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae holds a videoconference from the government complex in Sejong on Wednesday. [NEWS1]               The Ministry of Education on Wednesday abolished regulations restricting credits that can be earned through online classes in universities as remote learning becomes the norm amid the coronavirus pandemic.          The Education Ministry announced the measures as part of a focus on digital learning and innovative higher education in the post-coronavirus era, lifting the current restrictions that capped online classes at 20 percent of a student's credits.             It also allowed earning a master’s degree online starting next year, and enabled Korean and foreign universities to issue joint degrees virtually. Students who may have planned to study overseas, were it not for Covid-19, may therefore still be able to earn degrees from foreign universities through online courses as early as the first half of 2021.            The measures address the need to improve the quality of online lessons as the Covid-19 pandemic has forced universities to conduct much of their classes remotely since the spring semester.             Starting this semester, schools will be able to freely determine what proportion of students' overall credits can be earned through online classes.           Likewise, the ministry is also expanding ways for regular four-year colleges and cyber universities to transfer credits. A trial model for credit transfers will be run at some national universities, starting with the fall semester, and expand to other colleges next year.             “Universities should use the unprecedented Covid-19 situation as an opportunity for innovation,"" Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae, who doubles as deputy prime minister of social affairs, said during a meeting at the Sejong Government Complex.           But while remote learning has become the new normal of higher education during the pandemic, many students remain dissatisfied with the quality of online classes.             According to a recent survey conducted by the Yeungnam University’s higher education research institute on 28,418 university students nationwide, nearly half of respondents didn’t think schools prepared enough for online classes.             Some 21.2 percent of respondents thought that their universities made ample preparations for online lessons, according to this survey. By contrast, 48.1 percent of respondents thought that the amount of preparation made by their university for online classes “was not high.”             Just 26 percent of students responded that their professors prepared enough for online classes, compared to 38 percent of those surveyed who thought they did not make enough preparations.             However, 71.9 percent of university students responded that remote lessons should be expanded in the post-coronavirus era.             The Education Ministry said it is working to improve the quality of online lessons and will establish a remote education support center which can allow professors and students to evaluate online lectures starting with the fall semester. The government also plans to include the quality of remote classes in its college evaluation criteria and is working to provide smart devices to disadvantaged students.             It also plans to support personnel training in new technology and encourage universities to focus on education in areas including artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. This is a part of the government's plan to produce 100,000 personnel trained in new technology by 2026.             Following a spike in coronavirus cases last month, as of Wednesday morning, 7,948 kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools nationwide have shut campuses and reverted to online classes, according to the Education Ministry.            Of these schools, 88.6 percent, or 7,825, are in the greater Seoul area, including Gyeonggi and Incheon, with six additional students having been infected with Covid-19 on Tuesday.           BY NAM YOON-SEO, SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

Former assistant Joo Seung-jin had been the interim head coach since Lee Lim-saeng resigned in July.           It will be Park's first head coaching gig in the K League 1.           Park spent his entire 11-year K League career with Suwon and earned the Rookie of the Year in 1996. He also helped Suwon to three K League championships, one FA Cup title and one Asian club title.           After retiring in 2006, Park joined the Suwon bench as an assistant coach in 2007, and later managed Suwon's U-18 team and their reserve squad.           Park served as an assistant for both the U-23 and senior men's national teams, and had a brief stint as the head coach of the second-division club Seoul E-Land FC.           The post-playing career also took Park to China, where he worked as an assistant for Dalian Yifang and Shanghai Shenhua.           With eight matches remaining this season, Suwon are in 11th place among 12 teams with 17 points, only three ahead of Incheon United for the automatic relegation spot.           Suwon have never been relegated to the K League 2 since the promotion-relegation system came into place in 2013.           They recorded just two wins against five losses and one draw in eight matches under Joo.           According to Suwon, Joo could only serve in the head coaching role for 60 days because he didn't have the required Pro-Diploma, also known as ""P"" license. Joo's application for the P license certification course was rejected by the Korea Football Association (KFA), sending Suwon scrambling to find a new full-time boss.           ""I will give everything I have to save our club from the crisis,"" Park said.

590,"Sanofi pulls out of Hanmi diabetes drug trials, ends contract","

     Hanmi Pharmaceutical's headquarters in Songpa District, southern Seoul. [HANMI PHARMACEUTICAL]               Paris-based Sanofi has decided to drop ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials and marketing rights of Hanmi Pharmaceutical’s efpeglenatide, a diabetes drug.           The decision came after a 120-day negotiation period between the two following the French pharmaceutical company expressing its intent to exit the project in May.           “Sanofi finalized the decision on Tuesday and notified medical institutions conducting clinical trials,” said a Wednesday statement from Hanmi Pharmaceutical, which sold the marketing rights to Sanofi in 2015.           Efpeglenatide was undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials in more than 30 countries on over 6,000 patients worldwide. Among the five clinical trials that Sanofi was conducting, Hanmi will take over operations of one which is nearing completion in October. The other four will be halted.             “Once we have the results, we’ll look for ways to use that data — whether it’s for discovering new diseases to treat with efpeglenatide or testing its efficacy when used with other bio pharmaceuticals,” said a Hanmi spokesman.           “Apart from the specific efficacy as a diabetes drug, clinical trials will give basic information about efpeglenatide, like safety, which could be reused in other research.”           In December 2019, Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson announced plans to discontinue research into diabetes treatments as part of a strategy to increase focus on key growth drivers. According to Hanmi, the difficulties of conducting mass-scale clinical trials during the coronavirus pandemic also added to the French pharmaceutical firm’s decision.           Sanofi’s exit marks the termination of a 2015 deal which was the largest in the history of the Korean pharmaceutical industry, worth 3.9 billion euros ($4.6 billion) including milestone payments for three diabetes drug candidates. The rights for two were abandoned the following year while the efpeglenatide deal lasted until this year.             From the upfront payment of 400 million euros, Hanmi had returned 196 million euros for the two drugs that Sanofi returned the rights to in 2016, but will keep the remainder.             Hanmi is hoping that efpeglenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, can be developed to treat other metabolic syndromes. Called GLP-1 RA for short, these treatments are most frequently used for diabetes but can be used in diseases related to weight or appetite maintenance.           Hanmi’s LAPS-GLP/GCG, for example, was licensed out last month to Kenilworth, New Jersey-based MSD as a drug candidate to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, instead of the diabetes drug it was formerly licensed to Johnson & Johnson's Janssen.            BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
591,Animated movie 'Beauty Water' examines society's lookism ,"

     Producer Jeon Byung-jin, left, and director Cho Kyung-hun pose in front of the poster for their animated film ""Beauty Water"" which hit local theaters on Wednesday. [SS ANIMENT]                “Here are the instructions on how to use beauty water. You can say goodbye to the face before you. Pour beauty water and water in the ratio of four to one, and dip your face in the liquid for 20 minutes. You think this is too long? Compared to the time you’ve endured suffocating for your looks, it’s nothing. Now, don’t be alarmed by what you’re about to see. It’s about being reborn into a beautiful self.”           It’s a fantasy come true: Instead of undergoing painful surgery, apply a substance and mold your face and even your body to fit society's beauty standards.            When producer Jeon Byung-jin was researching various stories, novels, comics and webtoons to turn into an animated film in 2013, he stumbled upon episodes of “Beauty Water” from the Naver webtoon “Tales of the Unusual” by cartoonist Oh Seong-dae and thought it was the perfect fit.           The story revolves around protagonist Ye-ji who comes across an advertisement for beauty water and becomes trapped in her desire to become beautiful.             Months before the local horror film “Beauty Water” hit local theaters on Sept. 9, the film already made headlines when it was invited to compete in this year’s Annecy International Animation Film Festival in May. The film has been invited to 12 other international film fests and sold its distribution rights to five countries —Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand.             In a press interview on Tuesday, producer Jeon Byung-jin, who was in charge of the project for six years, and director Cho Kyung-hun, in charge of animation, still seemed dazed by the global appeal the film has garnered.             “We were targeting the global film market from the start, but didn’t expect this,” Jeon said during the interview at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. “Especially considering how much trouble we had in the beginning.”             The following are edited excerpts from the interview.           There are a lot of other episodes from Oh’s webtoon. Out of the many, why did you choose “Beauty Water?” Jeon: We were targeting the global film market, especially China. The two types of genres that are popular are romantic comedies and horror. But due to media censorship, the level of what we can express for romance is very limited. So we decided to do a horror film instead.Most of the local works were based on rumors and tales, and only Oh’s webtoon was an original.Initially, we were planning to release a series of omnibus films from “Tales of the Unusual.” While we were planning to acquire the webtoon’s intellectual property (IP), suddenly, “Beauty Water” became a huge hit in China. So our project’s focus shifted toward that story. But then Korea-China relations soured after the deployment of the U.S.-led Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) antimissile system to Korea, and what initially was our merit became a penalty, as we couldn’t receive any investments from Chinese companies.         There were also some variations and plots that you added to make the story into a film. Can you tell us about those changes and the message you wanted the film to portray?  Cho: The original webtoon centered around the substance of the beauty water, but the film puts that aside and focuses on the protagonist Yeji. We blueprinted various conflicts and worries Yeji has, to build her up as a character and her relationships with her surroundings.  Truth be told, Yeji isn’t a character that an audience would feel [any sort of] affection toward or sympathy for. But at the very least, we wanted people to understand why Yeji feels that way and get them to follow her fluctuating emotions when she’s put in different circumstances.As for the message, we wanted to ask the question 'what is beauty?' What matters really [both in the film and in reality] is how we define ourselves based on others’ perceptions. Even when Ye-ji becomes beautiful, she’s unable to escape that bridle [of lookism] that binds her. I think we can’t ever escape that, because we are humans. We were born that way, were taught that way and we are beings that create standards and pass judgement.         Ye-ji, scarred from other people's attitudes about her appearance, comes across ""beauty water,"" which allows her to reshape her appearance without surgery. [SS ANIMENT]        Ye-ji enjoys the attention she receives after she is transformed. [SS ANIMENT]              Animated films usually have elements of fantasy. However, the characters and plot in “Beauty Water” do not deviate that far from reality. How was creating such a film different from working on other animated projects? Cho: When we were working on the film, we didn’t really think that we were creating an animated film because “Beauty Water” was so much different from previous animations that we worked on. About 90 percent of the film is made up of the characters ‘ dialogue and their emotions. In other animations, the characters freely move around, change their forms, but that’s restricted in this film. So although it’s an animated work, there were lots of aspects which were closer to a live-action film.         Why did Ye-ji’s voice change after she became beautiful? Jeon: We weren’t able to ignore the stereotypes that people have. It’s a theatrical illusion, but when you’re pretty, [people expect] a pretty voice too. When that equation was broken, we couldn’t focus on the character, so instead of making it realistic, we decided to be dramatic.  Cho: All the voice actors were against [using the same voice] because it just didn’t fit, either way. To use a “pretty” voice in Ye-ji’s past looks or vice versa. But we did try to reduce the difference in voice tone as much as possible.              Ye-ji suffers from her desire to stay beautiful after her transformation. [SS ANIMENT]              In the real world, when have you encountered lookism? Jeon: Personally, I think that the television itself is like a castle for the privileged [for exceptional beauties]. As the generation of YouTube was born, that wall was pulled down a bit, but I think lookism just seeps into society once we turn the TV on.  Cho: Although we exaggerated the characters and the plot to emphasize the violence that comes from people’s judgement, I felt the reality was not that much far apart. In all media formats, it’s become so normalized to “attack” comedians and celebrities whom we’ve categorized as ugly or fat.         What do you want to achieve through “Beauty Water”? Jeon: While I was developing the script, I thought there were plenty of other stories from “Tales of the Unusual” to turn into a film. I hope “Beauty Water” becomes the foundation to start our own brand of horror stories such as “Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories” or “The Twilight Zone.”  Cho: There are so many high-quality IPs that we could use from novels, webtoons and games— they each have their own concepts and attractions. In animated films, it’s crucial that we preserve such qualities within our [limited] budget. In the current local animation industry, setting a good precedent is really important to become a stepping stone for the industry to move forward. I hope “Beauty Water” can become such a case.           BY LEE JAE-LIM   [lee.jaelim@joongang.co.kr]   "
592,"Tech companies in the FTC's sights, chairwoman says","

     Fair Trade Commission Chairwoman (FTC) Cho Sung-wook holds a press briefing on her first anniversary as the head of the antitrust agency at the FTC headquarters in Sejong on Tuesday. [YONHAP]               Tech companies have been put on notice by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), with Chairwoman Cho Sung-wook saying that the antitrust regulator will act decisively if it finds any violations by them.           She also noted the FTC will conclude its review of the acquisition of Baedal Minjok, or Baemin, by Berlin's Delivery Hero before the end of the year.           In a press briefing held on Tuesday celebrating her first anniversary as the head of the commission, Cho said the FTC is keeping an eye on the app commission system.             “We are closely monitoring the market competition situation and the impact on the consumers from changes in commission charges in the app market,” Cho said. “It is a problem that has been created from the lack of competition in the app market.”             Google is set to extend its 30 percent commission to in-app purchases from all mobile services, including Naver, Kakao and other music and video services. Previously, it only charged the 30 percent commission on gaming app transactions.       Apple has been charging in-app fees for all mobile services since 2011.             The FTC ""will not allow any anticompetitive practices and will punish those that engage in them,” Cho said.             The FTC chairwoman denied that the antitrust agency has become soft, saying that the commission is simply more thoroughly reviewing the evidence in applying the law.           The commission has been accused by civic groups of going easy on Mirae Asset Group Chairman Park Hyeon-joo after the brokerage was found to have engaged in illegal related-party transactions. In the case, the company was fined 4.39 billion won ($3.68 million).           If Park has been prosecuted, the country's largest brokerage would have been prevented from entering the commercial paper and investment management account (IMA) markets.           “The FTC hasn't become soft,” Cho said. “I would like to stress that we have evaluated properly the information provided by the investigation department.”             She said the case clearly demonstrated the evidence-based decision-making of the FTC as well as its neutrality and the independence.           “If there is insufficient evidence or lack of a legal basis, we will not report the case to the prosecutors,” Cho said.             Cho also defended the FTC on its approach to a complaint against Apple in which it allowed the company to come up with its own remedy.           Apple Korea was accused of forcing local telecommunication companies — SK Telecom, KT and LG U+ — to pay for Apple’s marketing expenses and repairs under warranty since 2016.             “In a rapidly changing industry, if a case takes five to 10 years, the impact on the market will be limited,” Cho said. “The consent resolution system contributes to quickly helping those that have been negatively affected and influencing the market.”             She said while the FTC will further strengthen its investigation capacity, it will further enhance the consent resolution system, which compels the accused to voluntarily make changes to their unfair business practices, if needed.           The FTC chairwoman also commented on the acquisition of Baemin by Delivery Hero.             ""As the merger has a huge impact on the market, we are currently reviewing the case thoroughly,"" Cho said. ""The results of the review will be completed by the end of the year.""           In December, Delivery Hero announced the purchase of Woowa Brothers, the operator of Baemin, in a $4 billion deal.             Delivery Hero already owns Yogiyo, and the concern is that it will monopolize local food delivery with the acquisition of Baemin.           In June, Yogiyo was hit with a 468-million-won fine by the FTC for forcing restaurants that use its app to lower prices on Yogiyo services or raise the prices for competing services. The company engaged in these practices between 2013 and 2016.             Baemin was criticized for trying to raise fees in April.           Cho hinted that the commission was near a decision on the merger between Hyundai Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Engineering.             Cho said one of the achievements during her first year was a crackdown on undisclosed advertising on Instagram and YouTube.             “It sent a warning,” Cho said.             She added that while there are concerns over several influencers committing such violations, she stressed Instagrammers and YouTubers must follow the rules for voluntarily disclosing payments from advertisers.             BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]               "

The number of scooters doubled since May, when the total was 16,580.           서울시에 따르면 8월 31일 현재 서울에는 16개 업체가 3만5850대의 전동킥보드를 운영 중이다. 이는 지난 5월 1만6580대에서 두 배로 늘어난 것이다.                       Run by private companies, mostly start-ups, shared electric scooter services are similar to the shared bike service operated by Seoul Metropolitan Government. The main difference is that the bikes have to be returned to designated racks. Scooters can be left anywhere.         shared bike service : 공유자전거 서비스          대부분 스타트업 등 사기업이 운영하는 공유킥보드 서비스는 서울시가 운영하는 공유자전거 서비스와 비슷하다. 주요 차이점은 자전거는 지정된 랙에 자전거에 되돌려 놔야 하지만 공유킥보드는 아무 곳에나 놔둬도 된다는 점이다.                       And everywhere they are left. They are in front of restaurants, on foot paths, at crosswalks, in car parking spots and in the middle of busy markets. They have been spotted in the center of streets.         foot path : 보행자 통로  crosswalk : 횡단보도          그리고 정말 모든 곳에 전동킥보드가 놓여있다. 킥보드는 음식점 앞, 보행자 통로, 횡단보도, 주차장, 붐비는 시장 한가운데에 있다. 거리 한가운데에도 있다.                       The number of complaints relating to the use of electric scooters this year reached 1,951 as of end of July, according to data from the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission. For full-year 2019, the number was 1,927, and in 2018, it was 511.         Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission : 국민권익위원회       국민권익위원회에 따르면 전동킥보드 관련 민원은 올 7월 현재 1951건에 달했다. 이는 지난해 1년 간 접수된 1927건을 넘어서는 것이다. 2018년에는 511건이었다.                       Operators of scooter-sharing services are making efforts to tackle the backlash. Olulo, operator of Kickgoing, and PUMP, operator of Xing xing, established 24-hour-a-day hotlines for local district offices so that company employees can clear their scooters within two hours of a complaint.         tackle : 씨름하다, 맞붙다  backlash : (대중의) 반발       공유킥보드 운영업체들은 민원에 대응하기 위해 노력하고 있다. 킥고잉을 운영하는 올룰로, 씽씽을 운영하는 피유엠피 등은 구청에 24시간 핫라인을 개설하고 민원이 들어오면 2시간 안에 킥보드를 수거한다.                       Some critics argue that foreign companies have recklessly increased the number of scooters in pursuit of revenue, to the point that it has become nearly impossible for them to respond to problems.         critic : 비평가  revenue : 수입, 매출          외국 업체들이 매출 확대를 위해 거의 감당할 수 없는수준으로 무분별하게 운영 대수를 늘려왔다는 지적도 있다.                       The issue isn't just about the shared service providers. According to the Korea Transport Institute, a total of 481,427 electric scooters were imported from 2017 to Aug. 2019. Of them, some 50,000 are estimated to be operated by scooter-sharing services, which means that the rest are owned by individual riders.           이는 서비스 제공업체만의 문제는 아니다. 한국교통연구원에 따르면 2017년부터 2019년 8월까지 수입된 48만1427대의 전동킥보드 중에 약 5만 대가 공유서비스 업체들이 운영하는 것이다. 나머지는 개인이 소유하고 있다는 뜻이다.                       “Companies limit the maximum speed of theirscooters to 25 kilometers [15.5 miles] per hour and constantly tell users to follow the basic rules,” said Jung Mina, director of Korea Startup Forum. “It’s time individual riders who don’t keep order on the streets are educated as well.”           정민아 코리아스타트업 정책실장은 “업체에선 속도를 시속 25km 이하로 제한하고 이용자 교육도 열심히 한다”며 “무질서하게 이용하는 개인 이용자 대상 교육이 필요한 상황”이라고 말했다.                       The Seoul Metropolitan Government is in discussions with 16 electric scooter companies, including Kakao Mobility, Lime, Olulo and PUMP, to establishguidelines for electric scooter drop-off locations.         drop-off : 렌터카 등을 사용한 후 인계하는          서울시는 카카오모빌리티, 라임, 올룰로, 피유엠피 등 16개 주요 업체와 전동킥보드 주차 장소 가이드라인을 만들기 위해 협의 중이다.                       One possibility is to agree on the types of places where scooters can be left, such as benches, telephone booths and lampposts, and to publish of a negative list of places where leaving them is forbidden, like in the middle of roads and sidewalks and at subway exits and building entrances.         lamppost : 가로등 기둥  sidewalk : 보도, 인도          벤치·전화 부스·가로등 등은 주차 권장구역으로, 도로 가운데·보도·지하철 입구·건물 입구 등은 주차 제한구역으로 설정하는 데 합의할 가능성이 있다.                       번역:박혜민 경제산업부장 [park.hyemin@joongang.co.kr]    "

597,Korean material patents face mounting challenges from Japan,"

                  After the Japanese government tightened restrictions on exports of chip and display materials to Korea in July 2019, Seoul launched an initiative to support local production and end the heavy dependence on Japanese imports.           In the past year, the initiative has seen some positive outcomes: Some Korean companies succeeded in replacing Japanese suppliers for chip and display production, while top Japanese suppliers saw revenues drop on year.           As Korea’s drive to localize supply continues, there are signs that Japanese companies are preparing to fight back — this time through lawsuits claiming infringement on intellectual property.           According to Datz-IP and Keywert — both international databases for intellectual property (IP) cases — six suits have already been filed in Japan against Korean companies this year. Last year, there were only four for the entire year.           “Considering there’s about 50 IP-related disputes occurring in Korea each year, these figures are not small at all,"" said Park Seung-kwan, a researcher at the Korea Patent Attorneys Association.           In July, an individual started opposition proceedings in a Japanese court against a patent held by LG Chem, Korea’s largest battery maker. The patent regards active materials for rechargeable batteries and their manufacturing method.                             Posco and Samsung SDI have faced similar opposition proceedings from individuals in Japan regarding patents related to battery technology. Last year, Kolon’s patent on a polycarbonate material was also challenged in a Japanese court.           It’s not only big companies that have been targeted. Koh Young Technology, a mid-sized Korean manufacturer of chip production equipment, is also facing opposition proceedings in a Japanese court over patent on semiconductor test equipment and testing methods.          What’s notable is that all of the suits filed in Japan are opposition proceedings. This form of legal challenge asks for the patent to be re-examined, challenging its validity. Opposition proceedings are often filed ahead of intellectual property infringement lawsuits, as a successful case can support later lawsuits.           “Oppositions can be filed not only by corporations, but even individuals that don’t have a direct interest. It’s a tactic used by companies ahead of embarking on a full-fledged IP suit,” said Park.            In other words, the suits currently filed by individuals suggest that a corporate legal battle could follow.          “Regarding lawsuits filed from Japan in the field of materials and components, there’s been a particular increase of IP suits targeting Korean companies for rechargeable battery technology,” said Yun Jung-ho, Keywert CEO.           “A lot of Korea’s key export items, including semiconductors, still employ a lot of Japanese materials, parts and equipment, which is why legal battles are not visible in this segment. But if the localization drive continues, it’s likely that we’ll be seeing more legal battles in fields like rechargeable batteries.”                           This is why some experts are against the government aggressively pushing for production to be localized.            According to government data, 72 patents were registered in regards to industrial materials, parts and equipment. As for hydrogen fluoride, photoresists and polyimide — the three materials that Japan first tightened export restrictions on in July 2019 — some companies have already seen progress in localizing production.             But Japan has traditionally been a technology leader in the segment, which is why Korea’s top IT and electronics makers have had such a high dependence on Japanese suppliers.            This hasn't really changed. According to the Korea International Trade Association’s data for the January to May period this year, nearly 95 percent of petrochemical materials imported to Korea were from Japan. Eighty-seven percent of semiconductor manufacturing equipment imports and 78.1 percent of fine chemistry ingredients came from Japan as well.          “There’s been widespread sentiment that Korea won and Japan lost in the battle since Japan tightened export regulations, but the reality is different. Japan still holds a lot of patents,” said an anonymous senior executive working in the electronics industry.           Hong Jang-won, chairman of the Korea Patent Attorneys Association, pointed out that the tendency with registered patents in Japan is to use broader terms to refer to the core technology to widen the scope of the rights. The more specific a patent is, the harder it is to violate it.           “Hasty patent registrations have a higher possibility to be caught on Japan’s radar,” he said. “Korea should work hard to build a strong patent portfolio and come up with a strategy ahead of Japan’s IP attack.”          BY KIM TAE-YOON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
598,"Two more funds frozen, illiquid foreign assets are blamed","

     Korea Finance & Service Workers' Union members protest against the government's lax regulations of investments in front of the Blue House in July. [NEWS1]               Hundreds of billions of won of customer money has been frozen by two funds, the latest in a series of such suspensions that have left trillions locked up and possibly lost.             Kiwoom Asset Management Tuesday told securities companies selling its funds that it would be unable to immediately return 360 billion won ($303 million) in customer money invested in the Kiwoom Global Alternative Fund. VI Investment Corporation earlier this month announced that 100 billion won could not be returned from its VI H2O Multibond.             The suspended products are funds of funds, which pool money from investors and then use that money to buy shares in existing funds. They both got into trouble by investing in French-domiciled funds from Britain's H2O Asset Management.           Because of the ownership of illiquid private securities, H20 was ordered by French regulators to segregate bad assets from the good. H20 subsequently froze eight funds.             Kiwoom says around 20 percent of its assets are in troubled funds from H2O, and around 6 to 8 percent of those assets are illiquid. In the case of VI, 5 percent of the frozen funds hold illiquid assets from H2O.             The biggest seller of the Kiwoom funds was Kookmin Bank, which marketed 37.5 percent of the total. Other sellers include Samsung Securities, Shinhan Bank, the Industrial Bank of Korea and Woori Bank. In the case of VI, the funds were only sold to institutional investors.             Kiwoom and VI argue their situation is different from the troubles faced by Optimus and Lime.             “We decided to suspend repayment of the funds temporarily as it's difficult to assess its actual value while H2O is in the process of separating the illiquid assets from others.

600,Covid-19 treatment production starts ahead of approvals,"

     KCDC Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook at a press briefing in August. [YONHAP]         Mass production of Covid-19 treatments will begin in Korea this month, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.           The treatments will not be immediately available for public use. They are being manufactured in anticipation of regulatory approval and the sudden uptick in demand that will result.           The Korean government is working with two partners under a national initiative to develop a treatment for Covid-19.             GC Pharma is developing the GC5131A plasma treatment candidate, which is made from immune proteins extracted from blood plasma donated by people who have recovered from an infection. Celltrion is the other partner. It is working on the CT-P59 antibody treatment candidate.           According to KCDC Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook, mass production of the GC Pharma plasma treatment started today and will be completed by mid-October. According to the company, part of the output will be used for trials, but most of it will be saved for public use in the future. GC Pharma mass-produced its first batch of the treatment in August, but that volume was reserved for clinical trials.             “The plasma treatment was approved for Phase 2 clinical tests on Aug. 20, and it is currently being tested at six medial institutions to verify safety and efficacy,” Kwon said during a daily press briefing on Tuesday.           Mass production of Celltrion treatment will start this month, Kwon said.             “Phase 1 clinical tests for the antibody treatment was completed, and the results are being analyzed. Another Phase 1 trial for light-symptom coronavirus patients was approved on Aug. 25, and we’re currently taking applicants from patients who want to participate,” said Kwon.            “The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is reviewing approval for Phase 2 and 3 trials. The plan is to start mass production for commercialization in September.”           Celltrion founder and chairman, Seo Jung-jin, said Monday that the company will submit a request for emergency use at the end of the year if Phase 2 clinical trials confirm the treatment candidate’s efficacy.           “I hope Phase 2 and 3 trials can start by the end of September,” he said during an opening speech of the Global Bio Conference hosted by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on Monday.           “We’re expecting Phase 3 trials to be completed by May, at latest. Under this scenario, mass production will start this month so that supply can meet domestic demand.”           Remdesivir, which is from Gilead Sciences and is the only Covid-19 treatment approved for emergency use in Korea, has been supplied to 274 candidates in Korea as of Tuesday.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
601,"Thousands of trainee doctors return to work, while some vow to continue walkout","

     Trainee doctors assigned to emergency response at the Seoul National University Hospital in central Seoul head back to work, ending their 19-day strike Tuesday. [KIM SANG-SEON]               While thousands of trainee doctors returned to work at major general hospitals Tuesday — 19 days after walking out in protest of government medical reform plans — others are opting to continue their strike.          A complete normalization of the health care situation at hospitals is expected to take more time. Likewise, the issue of whether the government will give medical students another shot to take their state medical licensing exams after they boycotted the tests can emerge as a factor that could lead to another strike.             Interns and residents at the five major general hospitals in the capital — Seoul National University Hospital, Asan Medical Center, Seoul Samsung Medical Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and Severance Hospital — all returned to their jobs Tuesday.             The hospitals said the trainees can return to their tasks after testing negative for the coronavirus.             But some trainees at other general hospitals nationwide refused to return. Individual hospitals put to separate internal votes on whether to end the walkout, in spite of a young doctors’ emergency response committee representing interns, residents and fellows deciding on Monday to end the walkout that kicked off Aug. 21.             The government and the Korean Medical Association (KMA) reached a deal last Friday to suspend plans to increase medical school admissions and establish a public medical school until the Covid-19 situation subsides in exchange for ending the doctors’ collective action.             But the deal has been fiercely protested by some members of the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) who said their opinions had not been properly represented. Amid continued backlash, the leadership of the young doctors’ committee — which has led negotiations with other medical groups, lawmakers and government officials — including its head Park Ji-hyun, the president of KIRA, stepped down en masse Monday.           A new emergency response committee of young doctors was launched Tuesday, which could be another factor that can impact the normalization of medical services after some hospitals were forced to restrict emergency rooms and postpone nonessential surgeries amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The new committee is set to hold a meeting Tuesday evening to plan its direction.             Likewise, the government went ahead with holding the Korean Medical License Examination Tuesday, which has been boycotted by 86 percent of medical students.             The Ministry of Health and Welfare on Tuesday maintained that it will carry out the state exam, which already has been postponed by a week, as planned.           Doctors’ groups have demanded the government give the medical students another chance to sign up, but the government stressed that it is unfair to give any additional exceptions as the state-run exam has already been postponed once and applicants had until Sunday to sign up again.             “Because we already postponed the exam schedule once and extended the application period, we are not considering any plans to provide any additional opportunity to sign up,” Sohn Yong-rae, a Health Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing Tuesday. “In a situation where the medical students are boycotting the exam themselves, it is asking the government to achieve the impossible by asking to support them.”             KIRA has warned that it can always stage another walkout if the government doesn’t give the medical students another shot.             Only six medical students showed up at the Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul, for the first exam day Tuesday morning, compared with about 100 that have showed up in previous years.             The state exam will be carried out between Sept. 8 and Nov. 20.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]         "

604,A young magician shares the secrets of his sleight of hand ,"

     Ed Kwon demonstrates his magic with tarot cards. [PARK SANG-MOON]               At the magical demonstrations of 24-year-old magician Kwon Joon-hyuk, who is more frequently referred to by his English name Ed Kwon, there is no suspenseful music or spectacular lighting. He chooses not to wear a tuxedo or a top hat. Kwon’s performances are usually made in a conversational style at a table, with only a handful of invited guests.           According to Kwon, the more familiar type of spectacular magic shows done on a platform or stage, are not exactly what magic used to be in the most traditional sense.           “Such theatrical performance of magic represents one genre of many in this art,” he says. “Magic is an art form, just like music, fine arts, and literature. There are an indefinite possible of ways to interpret it, and hence we have different styles and different philosophies. I just happen to follow a very stoic and academic school of magic. Although I do not fully agree with some of the other magicians and what they are doing, who am I to judge?”           Kwon’s magical career is rather obscure and he usually only performs at private events. As the youngest magician in the world to hold a ph.D in magical performance art, Kwon has been invited to perform in Las Vegas and at The Magic Castle in Hollywood, Los Angeles, a mysterious clubhouse for magicians and magic enthusiasts.                The Magic Castle in Hollywood. [ED KWON]       Kwon performs at The Magic Castle. [ED KWON]               As a magician who emphasizes “communication” in magic, Kwon, who has been more active in the United States, recently returned to Korea to talk about his philosophical observations in magic at this year’s Content Communications Forum (CCF) organized by the Corea Image Communication Institute (CICI).                   To hear more about Kwon and his magical worldview, the Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with the magician for an interview at the Grand Hyatt Seoul on Aug. 28, where the CCF was held.             The following are edited excerpts from the interview.           Can you explain more about your ph.D in magic?       Magic, as an art form is rather elusive to the public. Very little is disclosed, but we have our own communities, our own schools, conventions, organizations and ceremonies. We also have certificates, awards and degrees. I do carry a ph.D in magical performance art. It was given to me from an institution known as the Fechter’s Finger Flicking Frolic. Nowadays we just call it the 4F convention.It’s an annual convention where 200 of the world’s finest magicians gather and present their theories and new performance pieces in Buffalo, New York. It’s an invitation only meeting, and you have to be recognized in one form or another to be even considered. When you are invited you have to present your material and when they deem you worthy, they award you with bachelors, masters or ph.D. I consider myself very fortunate to have been invited to the 4F four years in a row.        How did you get invited?   The president of that organization, Obie O’Brien, was visiting Korea in 2014 as one of the judges for the Asian preliminary competition to FISM (Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques), which is considered to be the Olympics for magicians. I was volunteering as a translator at the event. During my off time, I was toying around with a deck of cards and he happened to catch a glimpse of me doing that. He noticed that I was doing some rather advanced sleight of hand and told me to repeat it. Eventually he pulled out a business card and said that he wants me to attend the 4F. That was actually the first time I considered going to the United States.         What’s so magical about magic? How did you get into it in the first place?         My parents took me to a magic show when an American magician was doing a world tour. I was around seven years old. During the show, I couldn’t understand what the man was saying but there was something about that performance that really struck me in a deep way. Years later, I asked my mother if she could recall the name of that magician and she said it was David Copperfield.  Fifteen years from that day, I was in Las Vegas, shaking hands with David Copperfield at his party and even got to show him some of my numbers.         You emphasize the importance of magic being performed live, and that is why you don’t like your magic demonstrations to be recorded in any way, or appear on TV shows or run a YouTube channel. Why is that?         Magic has different schools and I come from a very traditional school of magic. I am one of the last magicians to be classically trained, in other words, to be formally trained by a teacher. I studied under a master who studied under another master and so forth.So there is this sense of heritage and lineage in what I do. I, like my mentors, am very reluctant to having my performance recorded in any fashion. That’s because I embrace the fact that it is impossible to capture magic and keep it canned. Magic is special because it is perishable.You have to be present in that moment, in that space with that person to experience it. If you experience it any other way, it’s not really the same anymore. I do not want to present anything less than what it could be so I’ve turned down what people would call great opportunities to be on TV.  That’s one of the many reasons why people outside the magic world are less familiar with my name. I choose to remain obscure because I think there is an important element or component of mystery that is lost the moment you expose yourself too much.         For you, what is magic?       For the longest time, magic served various purposes. It was there to heal. It was also there to sometimes intimidate or strike fear in people’s hearts when it was used in an abusive way for political and religious reasons. It was used to educate and to inspire. I strive to practice this type of ceremonial magic. It’s just part of who I am. 'Magician' is not merely a character that I play. I’m not pretending. I don’t even like the word performing or acting because that implies that there’s some kind of deception or falsehood taking place. For me, knowing how the trick is accomplished should not take anything away from magic.          You mean there are no tricks involved in your magic?       Magic is not the trick. It's about the idea rather than the object used to convey that idea.For the magical effect that I demonstrated with the cups, I even tell people exactly how it’s done – how the oranges materialized under the cups for example. When I played that number during the CCF event, I told people exactly how it’s done. But why were they all so surprised that there were fruits under the cups? It’s because there is always a great discrepancy between knowing and understanding. That was the whole point of that piece.I am just using what we call “sleight of hand” but don’t make the mistake of thinking that is magic. The magic spell, the incantation “Abracadabra,” is archaic Hebrew, and it means “my words shall become reality.”The Aristotelian philosophy is that your thoughts become your words; your words become your actions; your actions become your habits; your habits define your character; and your character ultimately guides your destiny. Then whenever our reality coincides or is harmonious with our intent or our will, that is an act of magic. Our words carry strength. They carry weight. But the fact that we often say things without really knowing the magnitude or the impact it will have on other people proves that we don’t know we are doing magic. But magic spells are real. We see them all the time.For example, when an advertisement says “Just one more.” It consists of just three words but it used to encourage millions of people to voluntarily smoke lung cancer. Magazines tell you that you don’t look good enough or you are not skinny enough, or you don’t have this car so you are not living the good life. They're all an evil magic spell, and they definitely influence the way we think. Magicians are people who can see through those spells and can manipulate them responsibly.         You also studied philosophy while learning magic. Why?       As a boy, I used to bother my parents and my teachers by asking endless questions. Where does this come from? Why does it move this way? Who named it? Why does it look like that? My dad, a scholar whom I deeply respect, would answer almost anything that I asked, and if he didn’t know the answer he will spend all night, consulting his immense library and somehow find an answer and come back to me the next day and tell me. I never stopped asking those questions and maybe that’s why I was gravitated toward magic in the first place because it is a practice that deals with the unknown, the mysterious.The more I did magic, the more I realized that magic was not in the tricks. It’s not about how it is done. It was more about why it is done and what it can do for people. At one point, I joined a catholic monastery in Minnesota and stayed there for two and a half years and studied western philosophy with the monks. I really saw it as the same thing. We are asking questions that cannot be answered. But it’s the act of asking those questions that really pushes us forward.         Can you explain to our readers more about The Magic Castle?         Performing magic at The Magic Castle is similar to a musician playing solo at the Carnegie Hall. It was my dream to perform at The Magic Castle several times since I was in my early teens. It’s a private clubhouse for magicians that was founded in 1963. This is a Victorian style mansion where the late Dai Vernon, the esteemed magician, resided and taught his students.One has to be invited by a member to enter the building. A lot of Hollywood celebrities are spotted there. It’s a very exclusive and secretive night club. Wonderful, wonderful place.       Your wand looks quite unique.         It’s unique to me. It’s the only one in the world like it. A Canadian craftsman made it for me from scratch, exact to my specifications.It is something that is very hard to explain. If you were a magician and I told that the magic wand is probably the best kept secret in magic, you would agree.The wand is the tool that a magician uses to focus all attention or energy towards one singular point. It’s like universal language. Think of a modern day laser pointer. It’s just like the conductor’s baton.         I would think the most frequent question you are asked is, “How did you do that?” How do you respond?         I usually smile and say it’s irrelevant. It’s not important how it’s done.Who cares what kind of paint Vincent Van Gogh used to paint his “Starry Night.”What we care about is how mesmerizing and absorbing that painting is. We become one with the scenery. We transcend time and space to dream with Vincent.When I do magic for people, I don’t mind if you forget who I am.I don’t mind if you forget my name or what I did for you. It doesn’t matter how I did it. I can't care less about these things.What I do care about is that you remember how I made you feel.Pay attention to the feeling of magic that you experienced. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change form.Take that feeling of magic and pass it onto someone else with sincerity and love.That is real magic.                 BY YIM SEUNG-HYE   [sharon@joongang.co.kr]          "
605,Scandal over justice minister's son keeps snowballing,"

     Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae, left, leaves the National Assembly's main hall after she listened to a speech by Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the main opposition People Power Party. [YONHAP]                When Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae was serving as the ruling party’s chairwoman, someone from her office asked the Defense Ministry to give preferential treatment to her son, who was doing his military service, former Defense Minister Song Young-moo told the JoongAng Ilbo on Monday.             In an exclusive phone interview with the newspaper on Monday, Song said he recently learned that the military was asked to select Choo’s son as an interpreter for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February 2018.             Song served as defense minister from July 2017 to September 2018, and Choo served as chairwoman of the Democratic Party (DP) from August 2016 to August 2018. She became justice minister in January 2020.             “I belatedly received a briefing yesterday that such a request had been made, but [officers in charge of the selection process] rejected it,” Song said Monday. “I was briefed that the request came from the office of the DP’s chairwoman.”             The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) has raised a series of allegations that Choo abused her power to seek special treatment for her son when he was serving his mandatory military duty. Choo’s son, surnamed Seo, served in the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018.             In his latest revelation, PPP Rep. Shin Won-sik, a former lieutenant general who once served as deputy chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that officials in the administration and the National Assembly had tried to influence the selection process of military interpreters for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics to grant a post to Seo.             Shin quoted a former Army colonel who served as the commander of the Katusa forces at the time, as saying that he was pressured by the office of the defense minister and the liaison office of the National Assembly to dispatch Seo as an interpreter to the sporting event. The colonel said he had resisted the pressure to ensure fairness and selected 65 soldiers for the plum assignments by drawing lots.             Serving as an interpreter at a global sports event is a prestigious opportunity, which would look good on a résumé.           Song said he was briefed about what happened only after media reported about the alleged pressure.             Song said his former policy advisor, who used to be an employee of the DP, had tried to arrange special treatment for Seo.             The former policy advisor also admitted to the JoongAng Ilbo on Monday that he had been contacted by the office of then-DP Chairwoman Choo. He claimed he did not make any inappropriate request in response. “I just asked a rank-and-file level official of the ministry about the details of the selection process,” he said. “And I relayed the answer back to Choo’s office.”           He refused to say whom from the DP chairwoman’s office contacted him about the selection process.           He also said another official of Minister Song’s office had helped him. That official, however, when contacted by the JoongAng Ilbo, denied any involvement.          “He asked for my help to make Seo an interpreter, so I flatly rejected his request,” the official said. “I told him that it would be a violation of the Kim Young-ran Act[the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act].”           The official told the JoongAng Ilbo that the former policy advisor begged to get the phone number of the Katusa commander in charge of the selection process. He asked when the selection would be made. “I had the information, so I gave it to him,” he said.             While the members of the defense minister’s office told the JoongAng Ilbo different accounts, they all agreed that the office of DP Chairwoman Choo contacted the Defense Ministry directly about the selection process on behalf of Seo.           The PPP said it was clear that Choo had abused her power as the ruling party head to influence the selection process.           Choo has denied an earlier allegation that she had intervened to extend her son’s leave without going through a proper process, but she remained tight-lipped as of Tuesday about the latest allegation concerning the interpreter selection process.             The scandal over Choo’s suspected abuse of power to seek favors for her son started earlier this year, when opposition lawmakers raised a suspicion that Seo had been let off the hook when he went AWOL in June 2017. After lawmakers filed a criminal complaint in January, the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office started a probe, but no progress has been announced.             As the probe is moving slowly, whistle-blowers started talking to the media about alleged special treatment Seo had received. Former members of Seo’s unit said Choo’s aide had telephoned the military to request an extension when Seo failed to return to duty at the end of a leave. One whistle-blower specifically said he got the call and wondered why the aide was taking care of the lawmaker’s son’s business.           Seo took a medical leave from June 5 to 14, 2017. He extended the medical leave from June 15 to 23 and spent another four personal vacation days to take a total period of 23 days off. His former fellow soldiers said he was allowed to use the four personal days when he failed to return to the base on June 23, and Choo’s office made the arrangement.           Military officials said it was unheard of for a soldier’s medical leave to be extended without returning to the unit at the end of the period and undergoing a new medical review.           Seo’s lawyers said Tuesday that Seo was governed by the regulations of the U.S. Forces Korea, not the Korean Army, because he served as a Katusa soldier. The lawyers also said the U.S. Forces Korea only keeps a soldier’s annual and sick leave records for one year, and that was why Seo’s records are no longer available.           PPP lawmakers challenged the argument. Rep. Ha Tae-keung showed Tuesday the Defense Ministry’s statement that there is no special rule applied to the Katusa soldiers about their annual leaves and sick leaves. They are governed by Korean Army regulations, equal to any other soldiers in the Korean Army, the ministry said.             “It is a complete lie that a Katusa soldier follows the regulations of U.S. troops concerning their annual and sick leaves,” Ha said. “Katusa soldiers are under the command of the U.S. military for their daily missions and participation in operations and drills, but the Korean Army is in charge of their personnel affairs.”             Ha said all records on medical leaves are supposed to be filed under Korean Army regulations, and they must be kept for five years.             Earlier in the day, PPP Rep. Yoon Han-hong said five soldiers including Seo were granted sick leaves for more than 20 days  since 2016.            Among the five, only Seo’s medical records are missing from the archive, Yoon said.             As the scandal snowballs, the PPP pressured Choo to submit to an independent investigation by a special prosecutor, because the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office seemed unwilling to go after the justice minister.             During a National Assembly speech, Rep. Joo Ho-young, floor leader of the PPP, said Choo must submit to a special prosecutor’s probe or resign.           “It was wrong [for President Moon Jae-in] to begin with to appoint the former chairwoman of the ruling party as minister of justice, a job that requires neutrality,” Joo said.             “Why does the Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office fail to produce an outcome for its probe?” he said. “Choo once said we were writing a fiction when we first raised the suspicions against her. If so, she must submit to a special prosecutor’s investigation.

                  Korea said Tuesday it will provide more leeway to companies participating in state-sponsored research and development (R&D) projects, as the new coronavirus pandemic has led to more uncertainties in global industries.           Under the plan, the country will lift regulations in industrial R&D programs and allow companies to revise their research goals during their project as well, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.           State-sponsored R&D projects were previously virtually banned from adjusting their goals or changing spending plans of their budget due to strings of regulations.           With the Covid-19 pandemic causing economic jitters for businesses, the country said it will also ease the financial burden of private companies in state R&D projects, and induce more small- and medium-sized firms to join hands with conglomerates.           The industry ministry allocated 4.2 trillion won ($3.53 billion) in its R&D budget for 2020, rising sharply from 3.4 trillion won from 2019.           Korea plans to disburse 4.9 trillion won in the area next year.           The ministry said international R&D projects, which currently account for less than 3 percent of the ongoing programs, will account for up to 15 percent by 2023 by easing related regulations as well.           Yonhap         "

609,Ryu Hyun-jin gives up three homers in tough start against Yankees,"

     Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays throws a pitch during a game against the New York Yankees at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York on Monday. [REUTERS/YONHAP]                After a rocky first game, Ryu Hyun-jin of the Toronto Blue Jays was looking comfortable on the mound with his new Toronto team. Then he met the New York Yankees on Monday.           Starting against the Yankees at Sahlen Field in Buffalo, New York, Monday’s game didn’t work out in Ryu’s favor.            Things went wrong for Ryu at the top of the first inning. After easily recording the first out from DJ LeMahieu, Ryu immediately got into trouble by giving away back-to-back home runs to the Yankees’ first baseman Luke Voit and center fielder Aaron Hicks.            The Blue Jays' batting lineup came back, scoring a run at the bottom of the first inning to make up some of the early deficit. The Blue Jays then tied the game with another run at the bottom of the second. After tossing two scoreless innings, Ryu was back in a tough spot in the fourth inning.            While the two teams were tied at 2-2, Ryu gave up another home run, this time to designated hitter Miguel Andujar. Ryu then gave up two more runs at the top of the fifth inning and was pulled out of the game.            “After allowing two home runs in the first inning [with my fastball], I had to change my approach,” Ryu was quoted as saying on Yonhap. “I didn’t plan on throwing so many changeups, but I had no choice but to stay on the outside corner because I gave up home runs on the inside pitches.”           Throughout the five innings, Ryu gave up five runs, six hits and two walks, while striking out five. Due to this, his ERA jumped up from 2.51 to 3.19.            Although Ryu looked likely to pick up his second loss of the season, the Blue Jays’ explosive batting lineup saved the day and Ryu walked away with another no decision. Ryu may not have been able to handle the Yankees, but the batting lineup certainly did.           While losing 6-2 at the top of the sixth inning, the Blue Jays made a huge comeback, scoring 10 runs at the bottom of the sixth including a grand slam from Danny Jansen.            “I gave up some early runs, and we had to play catch-up,” Ryu was quoted as saying. “Then, in the bottom of the sixth, our hitters really focused and did a tremendous job, in ways that I can’t even describe in words. I was happy to see Danny come up huge at the plate.”           This was the first time in just a little over 10 years that the Blue Jays have scored 10 runs or more in a single inning. The last time the Blue Jays managed it was back on Aug. 31, 2010, during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays. At the time, the Blue Jays set a club record scoring 11 runs in a single inning.            “It’s really hard to put it into words,” Ryu was quoted as saying on MLB.com. “These guys did an amazing job with the little things all the way to the big things.”           With the 10 runs, the Blue Jays ended up with a big 12-7 victory over the Yankees. This also allowed the Blue Jays to extend their lead at second place in the American League (AL) East, two games ahead of the Yankees at 23 wins and 18 losses.            While the Blue Jays outperformed the Yankees, Ryu's performance was the latest episode in an old story — throughout his major league career, Ryu has started against the Yankees three times and has never performed well.            Ryu faced the Yankees for the first time back in June 2013, while playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers. During that game, Ryu picked up a loss by giving up three runs and five hits, which included a home run, throughout six innings.            Last season he faced the Yankees for a second time, once again picking up a loss and giving up seven runs and nine hits, which included three home runs, throughout four and one-third of an inning.            Although Ryu didn’t pick up a loss this time, as he once again gave up three home runs, he doesn’t seem to have figured out the Yankees yet. Regarding his poor performance against the Yankees, Ryu said that he’ll try to do better next time.            Monday’s game was the worst of the season for Ryu. The ace pitcher struggled at the beginning of the season, starting his first month with an 8.00 ERA, but quickly started to look comfortably on the mound in his latest outings. Ryu now has three wins and a loss over nine games with an ERA of 3.19.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "
610,"Trump's reference to 'love letters from Kim' was sarcasm, he says","

     President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference on the North Portico of the White House, Monday, Sept. 7, 2020, in Washington. [AP Photo/Patrick Semansky]               U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday denied that he regarded his correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as “love letters,” saying his past use of the phrase was sarcastic.             “Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed 'love letters from Kim Jong Un' as though I viewed them as just that,” Trump wrote on his Twitter account Monday.             “Obviously, [I] was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!""           Trump’s somewhat belated about-face stands at odds with the effusive praise he has heaped on those letters exchanged with Kim at almost every turn in their diplomatic engagements for the past two years.            “He wrote me beautiful letters, and they’re great letters,” Trump said in a rally almost exactly two years ago, following his much-touted first summit with Kim in Singapore that June. “We fell in love.”           Yet according to Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser throughout much of that process, the president never truly intended to reach an agreement on Pyongyang’s denuclearization, but was largely fixated with the optics of staging a summit with the reclusive state and its leader.             The two countries’ unbridgeable differences ultimately came to light at Trump and Kim’s second meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February last year, after the president walked out on the North’s proposal to scrap its nuclear complex at Yongbyon in exchange for sanctions relief.             Though Pyongyang has insisted the personal relationship between its leader and Trump remains on good terms, it has since withdrawn back into its prior isolationism and vowed to expand its nuclear arsenal.             Trump’s attempt to now distance himself from the letters may be connected to a tell-all book from Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward, which is nearing release on Sept. 15, just weeks ahead of Trump’s reelection race in November.             According to its publisher Simon & Schuster, the book, titled “Rage,” may contain the contents of 25 personal missives exchanged between Trump and Kim that Woodward obtained.             A description of the book on Amazon states that Kim “describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a 'fantasy film,' as the two leaders engage in an extraordinary diplomatic minuet.”           That number, 25, generated surprise among observers, given that there were only around a dozen instances in which Trump or North Korea have revealed some sort of correspondence was exchanged.             The most recent alleged exchange took place in April, when Trump said in a briefing he received a “nice note” from Kim before reiterating they continued to share a “good relationship.”           The next day, however, Pyongyang publicly denied it had ever sent such a note, questioning Washington’s motives for what it called an “ungrounded” assertion.           Speculation was rampant earlier this year that the Trump administration may attempt a last-ditch effort to reach a deal with the North ahead of the presidential election, though nothing has yet materialized.           In fact, the diplomatic venture with North Korea has been all but absent from Trump’s campaign rhetoric, suggesting the White House itself is uncertain whether it has been as successful as the president has claimed in the past.             During his hour-long acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Trump expounded on the fight against ISIS, the elimination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and the signing of a peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as his major foreign policy achievements, but the talks with Kim received no mention.             One notable exception to that reticence was a comment Trump made last month, when he said he would make “deals with North Korea very quickly” if reelected in November.             By contrast, Trump’s Democratic rival Joe Biden said in January he would not continue Trump’s diplomacy with the North if elected, but would instead use sanctions to further isolate the regime.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]    "

                  Home prices in Seoul and its neighboring area have shown signs of stabilizing due to the government's measures to cool prices and supply more homes, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said Tuesday.           ""Market sentiment in the greater Seoul area, which had showed signs of overheating, appeared to have become calm in August,"" Hong said.           Last month apartment prices in Seoul largely remained flat, Hong said, citing industry data.           Apartment prices in Seoul rose 0.01 percent in the final two weeks of August, compared with a gain of 0.04 percent in the first week of last month, Hong said.           In particular, apartment prices in Seoul's Gangnam region remained flat last month, Hong said.           In July, the government announced its toughest measures yet to rein in rising housing prices, as a series of steps, including tax hikes and loan regulations, failed to put the brakes on soaring home prices.           The following month, the government announced it will supply 132,000 homes, including 110,000 homes in Seoul, in the capital city and neighboring areas by 2028 by easing restrictions on the construction of residential buildings.           As part of the supply measure, the government will start selling 30,000 public units in 2021 and another 30,000 homes in 2022 in the greater Seoul area, Hong said.           The eased rules allow redevelopment of aging apartment complexes to increase their floor area ratio to between 300 and 500 percent from the current 250 percent in order to build more units.           The floor area ratio is the ratio of the total plot area to the overall building area and is determined by the size of the plot and width of the road in front of the plot.           The rules also allow such redevelopment projects to build 50-story apartment buildings in the greater Seoul area, far higher than the existing 35-story height cap.           The plans are in line with the government's broad plan to supply a total of 1.27 million homes in Seoul and neighboring areas as early as 2028.           Yonhap   "

     Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisung Chung, right, and SK Innovation Chairman Chey Tae-won shake hands on July 7 when Chung made a visit to SK Innovation's battery factory in Seosan, South Chungcheong. [HYUNDAI MOTOR]               Hyundai Motor and SK Innovation will expand their partnership in electric vehicles (EVs) by exploring what's called the Battery-as-a-Service (BaaS) concept.           BaaS, a concept similar to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) idea utilized by car-sharing platforms like Uber, refers to managing various aspects of a battery's life cycle as demand for EVs increases.            The two companies said Tuesday that they signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in the field.           The cooperation will involve selling batteries as well as leasing or renting them, managing the batteries through their life cycles and recycling or reusing them.           “Unlike previous partnerships in which battery makers only supplied batteries to mobility companies, this aims to achieve BaaS, which will allow more varied partnerships between mobility and battery industries,” Hyundai Motor said in a release.           SK Innovation’s batteries in Kia Motors’ Niro EV will be the first in the project.           The companies will work on recycling batteries from EVs to be used as energy storage systems (ESS) and extracting metals from used batteries such as lithium, nickel and cobalt.           “The latest collaboration with SK Innovation, which is in charge of the first batch of batteries that will be used in EVs manufactured on the E-GMP platform, planned for operation from 2021, signals an important step toward further partnerships between battery and mobility industries,” said Chi Young-cho, president of Hyundai Motor in charge of the strategy and technology division.           Jee Dong-seob, CEO of SK Innovation's battery business, said the two companies will come up with new business opportunities throughout the life cycles of EV batteries that will contribute to the government's Green New Deal project.           Hyundai Motor Group and SK Innovation have already been collaborating in the EV battery business. The battery maker has been supplying lithium-ion batteries for Kia Motors' all-electric and plug-in hybrid models such as Niro and Soul.           SK Innovation rival LG Chem supplies its batteries for Hyundai Motor's eco-friendly models.           Hyundai Motor Group Executive Vice Chairman Euisun Chung has been active in expanding its partnerships with domestic battery makers this year.           In the first half of this year, Chung made a visit to manufacturing plants of all three battery makers — LG Chem, SK Innovation and Samsung SDI — to be briefed about each company's core technologies and met with their chiefs.           Samsung SDI doesn't currently supply batteries to Hyundai Motor. But the meeting between Chung and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong provoked speculation that an official partnership is near.           SK Innovation will supply the first batch of batteries for EVs assembled on the E-GMP platform from next year. LG Chem is in charge of the second batch. Suppliers for the third and fourth batches haven't been decided.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]  "
614,Asiana acquisition seen collapsing this week,"

                  HDC Hyundai Development’s planned takeover of Asiana Airlines appears likely to collapse this week as the property developer failed to narrow differences with the airline's creditors over acquisition terms, people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.             The deal, if it falls through, would become the country's second botched deal in the coronavirus-hit airline sector this year, following Jeju Air’s cancellation of its plan to acquire smaller rival Eastar Jet in July.           Kumho Industrial, which owns 31 percent of Asiana Airlines, is expected to notify HDC of the termination of the deal by Friday when government officials are set to meet to discuss ways to support the financially troubled carrier.           On Friday, ministers handling the Asiana deal and officials in charge of the state fund set up for the airline and other backbone industries are scheduled to have separate meetings.           Asiana's creditors — the Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Eximbank) — are expected to report their Plan B for the country's second-biggest airline to the ministers following the deal's collapse, industry people said.           They said the state fund is likely to inject 2 trillion won ($1.68 billion) into Asiana to help the cash-strapped carrier stay afloat this year.           The KDB and Eximbank have already extended a combined 3.3 trillion won, including 1.7 trillion won this year, in the past two years.             KDB Chairman Lee Dong-gull and HDC Chairman Chung Mong-gyu met late last month, but they failed to produce any breakthrough for the stalled deal amid the Covid-19 pandemic.           Lee reportedly suggested a sharp reduction in the acquisition price by 1 trillion won ($840 million) in the last-ditch attempt to push the deal forward.             But HDC once again demanded another round of due diligence on Asiana, which was already rejected by the creditors and Kumho Industrial.           Once the two sides announce the deal's collapse, Asiana is expected to be placed under the control of the creditors and undergo restructuring to find a new owner.             In December, the HDC-led consortium signed the deal to acquire a 30.77 percent stake in Asiana from Kumho Industrial, as well as new Asiana shares to be issued and the carrier's six affiliates, for 2.5 trillion won.           But the pandemic has emerged as a major stumbling block to the deal.           Asiana has suspended most of its flights on international routes since March.           It has had all of its 10,500 employees take unpaid leave for 15 days a month since April until business circumstances normalize. Asiana's executives have also agreed to forgo 60 percent of their wages, though no specific time frame was given for how long the pay cuts will remain in effect.             As a result, Asiana's net losses deepened to 432.88 billion won in the January-June period from 267.4 billion won a year earlier.           Yonhap   "
615,Korea Inc.'s overseas sales plummet in second quarter,"

     A view of the storage lot at the Hyundai Motor's Ulsan plant. The automotive industry suffered a 36.5 percent on-year drop in overseas sales in the second quarter. [NEWS 1]                Overseas sales for large local companies in the second quarter declined almost 20 percent on year as the pandemic hit foreign economies and global demand.           Overseas sales include both exports and sales by foreign subsidiaries of Korean companies.           The Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) released an analysis on Monday of the 2019 financial statements of the 100 most profitable Korean companies. According to the report, overseas sales dropped by 19.8 percent on year to 146.3 trillion won ($123.1 billion) during the second quarter. In the first quarter, companies raked in 170.4 trillion won from sales abroad.           The effects of the pandemic were only apparent in sales in China through mid-February, but they soon thereafter extended worldwide.             The rise of remote work and online education during the pandemic led to a relatively moderate drop for the electronics sector, which recorded 71 trillion won in overseas sales, a 5.1 percent decline from the same period in 2019. The automotive industry suffered a 36.5 percent decrease, as major car manufacturers halted production, and the international demand declined sharply.                              The overseas sales of the energy and chemical industry dropped by 30.9 percent. As oil prices nosedived at the onset of the pandemic, the business of oil refineries took a direct hit. The steel industry’s foreign revenue went down by 80.1 percent. This drop is mainly attributed to the reduction in demand for steel plates for automobiles.             Data of 20 firms that have disclosed their regional performance showed that sales in Asia went down by 24 percent and in North, South and Central America by 12.6 percent. Sales in the European market fell 11.2 percent.           Second quarter sales in China for Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, LG Electronics, SK hynix and Hyundai Mobis rose 5.9 percent on year. The FKI attributed the expansion in sales to an improving Chinese economy, which recorded 3.2 percent on-year growth in GDP during the second quarter.             The FKI urged government measures to ease the speed of decline of local company sales abroad, lobbying with foreign governments to allow the special entry of local employees into investor and partner nations.             “The environment for international business is in a worse situation than the Asian economic crisis in the 1990s and the 2008 global financial crisis,” said Kim Bong-man, secretary general of FKI’s international management institute. “Measures that promote cooperation with foreign governments are urgent for local companies that have entered foreign markets.”           BY LEE SOO-KI   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

He added that visitors to the Han River Park recently increased between 33 to 40 percent compared to the same period last year, and especially noted a spike last weekend.           In June, the Seoul government decided not to operate its seven riverside pools and water parks this summer because of the coronavirus.                        Korea for the sixth day kept new cases in the 100s Tuesday, adding 136 more Covid-19 patients, of which 120 were local infections and 16 imported. This was slightly up from 119 the previous day, the lowest number in 24 days, but markedly down from a five-month high of 441 new patients on Aug. 27.           Total cases reached 21,432 as of Monday midnight, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), while there were five more deaths, raising the total death toll to 341.             Of the new cases, 67 were from Seoul, 29 from Gyeonggi, two from Incheon and 12 from Gwangju.             Four new deaths were patients in their 70s to 90s from Seoul. Three deaths occurred around a week after the patients were diagnosed with Covid-19, and one patient didn’t have any pre-existing conditions. There are 151 patients in critical condition as of Tuesday.             Current clusters of infections are linked to religious facilities, kindergartens, offices and small gatherings.             One cluster, around a telemarketing call center in Gangdong District, eastern Seoul, has produced at least 22 patients since its first case was confirmed last Friday. The city government tested various samples to check the transmission route at the call center, and confirmed Tuesday that the Covid-19 virus was found on doorknobs and air conditioners in the office.             The city government urged call centers, offices and schools that are air conditioned to open windows and air out rooms at least once every two hours.             The KCDC said that infections linked to the Sarang Jeil Church in Seongbuk District reached 1,167 as of Tuesday, and 539 patients were linked to the Gwanghwamun antigovernment rally on Aug. 15.             A kindergarten in Gimpo, Gyeonggi, has a total of eight cases so far as the virus spread to a teacher, student and family members.           The government has expanded its Level 2.5 alert after restricting operations at franchises to include bakery, bingsu (shaved ice dessert) and ice cream chains starting Monday. But people keep finding alternative hangout spots, with crowds now flocking to fast food chains.             The government is also reviewing not exempting tolls on freeways to restrict travel during the Chuseok holiday, which falls at the end of this month.             Since 2017, the government has exempted tolls during such national holidays.             Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun on Sunday encouraged people to “minimize movement and stay home if possible” over the holiday.             The Cabinet approved plans to elevate the KCDC, created in 2004, as an independent administration starting Saturday, a move aimed at strengthening the country’s response to infectious diseases and giving the agency more authority by separating it from the Ministry of Health and Welfare.           President Moon Jae-in tapped Jung Eun-kyeong, current director of the KCDC, which has been overseeing the country’s coronavirus response, as the first head of the new Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), according to the Blue House Tuesday.             While presiding over a Cabinet meeting, Moon said, “The KCDC through its Covid-19 response has carried out a central role in leading the K-quarantine measures, which have been a model to the world.”             He went onto urge the KDCA to “strengthen the response to infectious diseases to another level” and to help “pass this critical moment with a resurgence in coronavirus cases and to stably and surely contain the coronavirus at an early date.”             The head of the new KDCA will be a vice minister-level official with autonomy to manage the budget and hire experts, while the total staff will be increased 42 percent to 1,476 personnel.             Moon also promoted Kang Do-tae, a deputy minister for planning and coordination at the Health Ministry, to the newly-created post of second vice health minister, said Kang Min-seok, the Blue House spokesman, in a statement.           The Health Ministry is expanding its leadership to two vice ministers from the current one. The first vice minister will oversee welfare, planning and coordination matters, while the second will oversee public health affairs.              President Moon Jae-in named Tuesday Jung Eun-kyeong as the inaugural head of the newly elevated Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) set to launch Saturday.

617,Google blames the customer in gift card scam,"

     E-mail response from Google. [JOONGANG ILBO]                     Recently, a 60-year-old woman received a message from her daughter saying that she was texting via computer because her phone was being repaired and that she needed money.           She asked her mother go to the nearest convenience store, purchase 150,000 won ($126) worth of Google gift cards, take pictures of the serial numbers and send the images.           It was all a scam.             “I purchased 30 gift cards from six convenience stores in the rain,” the woman said. “I thought my daughter was asking out of desperation.”             She had spent 4.5 million won.           The woman said the scammer pretending to be her daughter thanked her and said that they would be sending the woman money to buy a dress.           She only realized that she was being scammed when one of the convenience store owners told her that there were a lot of scams related to gift cards and asked if she had called her daughter.             The convenience store owner asked those questions as it was suspicious for an elderly woman to be purchasing Google gift cards, which are used for mainly online game money.           The number of messenger phishing scams has been increasing, yet there haven’t been specific measures that would bring a full stop to such scams.             The difference with past scams is that the latest scam asks the victim to send the serial numbers of gift cards rather than sending the money by wire.           Unlike stealing credit card numbers through hacking or planting a malicious code via smartphones, purchasing gift cards is considered a normal transaction between the buyer and the gift card issuer.             Tracking down the scammers is more difficult when compared to wiring money as there’s no good target for tracing, such as a bank account under a specific person.             It’s also easy to liquidate the gift card via internet.             According to the police, financial damage from messaging phishing is estimated at around 12.8 billion won between January and April. That’s a 52 percent increase compared to the same period a year ago.             The police in June issued a public alert about people sending messages with apps pretending to be family members. It noted that in general they ask for the serial numbers of gift cards, as suspicious wires can be canceled by banks. With the messenger gift card scam, not much can be done once the serial numbers are sent.           In the case of financial transactions-related phishing schemes, the victim can report the offense to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and possibly receive compensation. But the FSS does not accept reports on gift card scams as they are not considered financial transactions.             The FSS said the report needs to be made to the police.             Google does accept reports on gift card scams, but only on online, and the company only confirms whether the gift card has been used or not.             If the card has been used, Google says there’s nothing that it can do, and if the card hasn't been used yet, the best advice is to register the serial number to the person’s own account.             It’s an inconvenience considering that most of the victims are those in their 50s and 60s.           Culture Land, which issues mobile culture-related coupons, accepts scam reports online. Once the report is filed, the company bans the cards.             “In April, we received a cooperation request from the police against scams,” said a Culture Land official. “Since then, through our online bulletin board, we have started to accept scam reports and created consulting guidelines where we will respond immediately if it has the word ‘fraud’ or ‘theft’ in it.”             The 60-year-old woman’s daughter even sent an email to Google reporting the scam and asking for a refund. An emailed reply said while it will “do its best to block” the gift cards from being used, the company denied refund as the cards were not directly purchased from Google.             “I received the answer ‘You can educate your mother to not trust anyone online,'” the daughter said. “The hands-off response from such a major company like Google angers me.”             Google Korea responded to the JoongAng Ilbo that while it could not disclose the details about the management of Google products, it added it will do its best to prevent fraud.           BY HONG JI-YU   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

619,Retailers move toward refillables as an eco-friendly and cost-effective option ,"

     Local cosmetics brand Innisfree launches a series of refillable products named ’Re-Stay“ in late June. The dispensers are made using coconut bark and less plastic. [INNISFREE]               When refillable products first hit market shelves, they were labeled as more economical options and marketed at savvy shoppers.               If refillable products were preferred for economic reasons in the past, now they are considered eco-friendly alternatives that produce less plastic waste.             With an increasing number of companies producing refillable products as a way to tackle the plastic waste issue in recent years, more options are on offer compared to the past when only a few products such as dish soaps and detergents were available in refillable forms.             At a newly opened Orga Whole Foods, a grocery store located in Bangyi-dong, Songpa District, western Seoul, the franchise grocery chain is furnished with a refill station where customers can fill up their empty containers after using up their detergent or fabric softener.             The retail food store agreed on a business deal with the Ministry of Environment, which saw the entire store designed to produce less plastic and vinyl waste.             All customers need to do is bring their own containers and refill them. The total amount of product is calculated with a scale next to the refill station and the weight of the containers is deducted.                A refill bar where customers can purchase refillable shower gels at a discounted price is available at the Gangnam-daero branch of The Body Shop, southern Seoul. [THE BODY SHOP]               The Body Shop, a London-based cosmetics company, recently added a refill bar to its Gangnam-daero branch in southern Seoul. Six popular shower gels are available at the bar.             According to The Body Shop, it is the third store equipped with the refill bar across the world.             Well known for its green-minded philosophies, The Body Shop’s refill bar is part of the company’s endeavors to decrease plastic waste.            When using the refill bar, customers first need to purchase an empty, reusable bottle made with aluminum. The bottle is capable of holding up to 250 millilters (8.4 ounces) of fluid and is priced at 4,000 won ($3.40).             Customers then push down on the lever of their chosen body wash and fill up their containers. Near the refill bar, there is a huge sign that reads “One pump is never enough.”             The refillable shower gel is 20 percent cheaper than the original products.             Local cosmetics brand Innisfree also jumped on the bandwagon and launched a series of refillable products named “Re-Stay” in late June.             A wide scope of beauty products including hand soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion are sold in refillable pouches. They can be used as they are or decanted into dispensers.             The dispensers may look like they are made of plastic, and they partly are, but they use 30 percent less plastic compared to other typical containers as they are partially made with coconut bark.             In order to make it easy for customers to refill the containers, the dispensers are ergonomically designed, with wider openings suitable for cleaning and refilling. Simple designs and colors go well with any style bathroom, too.                Local beauty brand Aromatica produces a variety of refillable products. Dispensers are also made with recycled plastic.  [AROMATICA]               Launched in 2004, another local beauty brand Aromatica has been increasing its number of refillable products since 2016. The campaign first started with two types of shampoos and one cleanser, but now nine types of products come out with refillable options.             Since the company has been launching varied refillable products, it was able to devise ways to use less plastic for its refillable packages.            In the early days, the pouches were made with layers of different plastic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate — also known as PET — and linear low-density polyethylene, but now the company’s refillable pouches are made with simpler materials. The company plans to replace all of its plastic pouches with recyclable paper starting in October.             Apart from the refillable line, Aromatica’s original products are packaged in recycled plastic containers.             The company says about 70 percent of its customers used to purchase original products while the rest bought refillable ones in the early days, but the ratio has risen to 50-50 in recent years.             Some perfume makers encourage customers to reuse perfume bottles by providing refill services.                New York-based Le Labo Fragrances encourages its customers to reuse empty perfume bottles by providing a refill service.  [LE LABO FRAGRANCES]               New York-based Le Labo Fragrances is one of them. Every perfume from the brand, whether they are 50 milliliters or 100 milliliters, is refillable — but, there is one string attached. Only perfumes purchased from the company’s boutique branches located in Itaewon, central Seoul, and Garosugil, southern Seoul, are refillable.           When empty bottles are filled up, the perfume shop replaces the spray part and the label. Refillable perfume is 20 percent cheaper than the original product.             BY YOO JI-YOEN   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]                                                                           "

621,KDI lowers growth estimate for year to -1.1%,"

     A store in Namdaemun Market, central Seoul, with a notice saying it is vacant. As the coronavirus crisis hurts small businesses. the KDI on Tuesday lowered its economic growth forecast for 2020. [YONHAP]               The Korea Development Institute (KDI) lowered its estimate for economic growth again as the coronavirus crisis continues to depress consumer spending.             The state-owned think tank on Tuesday forecast the economy this year to shrink 1.1 percent. In May, the institute projected 0.2 percent growth.             Recently the number of daily confirmed Covid-19 cases has eased to around 100, a drop from above 400 recently.             However, with the government extending stricter social distancing regulations for a second week, consumer spending is expected to be affected significantly.           In its latest projection, the KDI estimates the economy will contract 1.4 percent in the second half of 2020, a stark contrast to the 0.5 percent growth projected in May.            The KDI projected consumer spending will shrink 4.6 percent year-on-year in 2020 annual. That’s double the 2 percent drop forecast in May.             In May, the KDI projected consumer spending in the first half of 2020 would contract 4 percent, and in the second half improve to a fall of only 0.1 percent year-on-year as the crisis improves.           In its latest report, it says consumer spending in the first half of this year dropped 4.4 percent. Spending in the second half is expected to decline 4.8 percent.             The KDI noted that thanks to emergency relief grants given to every Korean household between May and June, as well as other government policies including a cut in the consumption tax on new car purchases, consumer spending went up.           However, after these government support measures, spending began declining in July.             It projected that consumer spending in the immediate future will unlikely improve.           Consumer spending could be hurt by household incomes shrinking due to strict social distancing measures and their effects on businesses.             While the number of people employed shrunk 60,000 in the first half compared to a year earlier, that number is expected to surge to 250,000 in the second half.             The report predicted that exports will fall 4.2 percent in 2020, compared to a projection in May of a 3.4 percent decline.           The KDI noted that exports in the first half were lower than its initial projection.           In May, the KDI projected exports would decline 3.5 percent in the first half of this year. It turned out exports shrunk at a faster rate of 4.4 percent.           One contributing factor was tensions between the United States and China.           While the think tank noted that the situation could change after the U.S. presidential election in November, tensions between the two biggest economies in the world could continue.           The KDI raised concerns over the recent easing of social distancing in major countries including the United States and Europe, which could affect Korea's exports negatively. Unlike in April and May, when countries like Italy implemented full lockdowns, recent easings of measures could result in waves of infections. Some countries could be forced to implement stricter quarantine measures, the KDI noted.          The projection for imports in 2020 was changed from a 3.8 percent decline in May to a 4.2 percent drop.             One area that saw a sharp increase in the revised forecast was facilities investment. Earlier, the KDI projected companies’ facilities investment would inch up 0.9 percent in 2020. Its latest forecast projected a 4.2 percent increase.             The increase in facilities investment was largely due to greater demand for semiconductors than previously expected in the first half. Additionally, thanks to government policies such as the lowered individual consumption taxes on new car purchases, automakers’ investments have increased as well.             While the KDI expects the economy to recover next year, its growth projection has been lowered.             The KDI projects the economy to grow 3.5 percent in 2021, slower than the 3.9 percent growth projected in May.             “Not only has economic growth been lowered but also the possibility of an economic recovery has been pushed back due to the recent rapid resurgence of Covid-19,” said Cho Duk-sang, a KDI associate fellow researcher.             The KDI is just the latest institution to revise its growth outlook for the Korean economy.           Earlier, the Bank of Korea changed its outlook for this year from a 0.2 percent drop to a 1.3 percent decline.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "

626,Sangmu's Moon Seon-min named August's top player,"

                  Sangju Sangmu midfielder Moon Seon-min has been named the top player for August in Korean football.           The K League announced Tuesday that Moon beat out three other candidates for the Player of the Month honor after scoring two goals and setting up three others in five matches last month.           This is Moon's second monthly career award. He was the top player for October last year when he was playing for Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. Moon joined Sangju for this season to complete his mandatory military service.           Moon tied Gwangju FC striker Felipe for first by winning 16.7 percent of the vote from the K League's performance evaluation committee, which accounts for 60 percent of the award. In the fan voting, counting for 25 percent, Moon only ranked fourth with 0.8 percent. But in a vote by FIFA Online 4 players, making up the final 15 percent of the award, Moon led everyone with 11.5 percent of support.           With those percentages converted into points, Moon came out on top with 28.94 points, about three points ahead of Jeonbuk midfielder Kim Bo-kyung.           Moon will receive a trophy built by Electronic Arts (EA) Korea, the official video game partner of the K League, and will also wear a patch showing his Player of the Month award on his uniform for the remainder of the season.           Yonhap    "
627,[Hye-rim's Pick] The right book at the right time,"

     Cover of ""You do not always have to be the good person"" by Kim You-eun.  [SCREEN CAPTURE]               Reading the right book at the right time is like drinking the right cup of coffee.            I remember the day when one specific message stood out of the numerous messages I received on social media.            There it was, a book recommendation with a message saying, “I think you’ll like it as much as I did.” The title, ""You do not always have to be the good person"" spoke to me as I was struggling with relationships and skeptical about human relations. This essay written by Kim You-eun is based on overall relationships and self-esteem.                              I must confess I was in a dark state; confused and exhausted from people who portrayed themselves as friends but were nowhere to be seen when I needed them, or those who were only available when I was actively working.            Nonetheless, I tried to understand them and rationalize their actions. Sometimes, I even blamed myself for thinking I was being small-minded.           However, I realized that I let people in easily without having boundaries.            That backfired and sadly, some of them took my kindness for granted. Realizing this was painful and devastating. So, I needed time and space to readjust my relationships. It was at that time when I was introduced to the book. I must admit it had been such a long time since I had butterflies in my stomach waiting for a book to arrive.             Reading the book felt as if I was communicating with the author one-on-one. All I did was read, nod, and think, but I felt as if I was being understood and gradually found myself at ease.            Kim says, “The happy memories you had can’t be the reason to mend a broken relationship [...] You may have pieces of good memories with someone, but you cannot change someone who has already moved on. So, do not waste your energy on something that has already gone. You do not have to feel sorry or pitiful; you just need to learn to let go, not for anyone else, but for yourself.”           My favorite quote from the book is, “I gave up trying to be the good person. Do not sacrifice yourself for someone who does not show respect. Do not say it is all right when it is not. I decided to be good to myself.”             As I was reaching the last page, I felt lighthearted. I needed someone to tell me it was all right to take care of myself first, that it is okay, not to be okay. The book also helped me contemplate on how to use time wisely.            As Kim says, we should stop wasting our energy on what makes us sad, but instead, spend time with our loving friends and family. Kim learned to enjoy the little things that make her happy. For example, walking along the Han river with a beloved family member, taking drawing classes with her partner, writing to her readers or simply chatting with a good friend.               Reading the book was like listening to a ballad song on a rainy day. I must say that I have had the best communication recently with someone whom I have never met before. How ironic it is to connect with someone without saying a word.            BY WOO HYE-RIM   [kjdculture@joongang.co.kr]           Former Wonder Girls member       Senior of EICC at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies     Major: English for international conferences and communication (EICC)         Related Article[Hye-rim's Pick] The lesson to be learned from an old caterpillar [Hye-rim's Pick] Finding common ground in the admiration of words"
628,BOK service sends your change straight to the bank,"

     [SHUTTER STOCK]               Not sure what to do with that handful of 100 won ($0.08) coins you received after buying a cup of coffee? Don't worry, the Bank of Korea wants to get rid of them for you.           The central bank announced Tuesday a new service that deposits leftover cash from purchases at stores immediately into a customer’s bank account.           The service links an individual's QR code with their bank account, meaning that rather than receiving a handful of coins, a quick scan of the QR code sends the change straight to their account. Customers can also use the service with mobile cash cards, which can be made through 12 commercial banks. The central bank plans to add four more banks to the list by the end of this year.           Hyundai Department Store and Emart24 convenience stores will be the first retailers to introduce the service. Fifteen Hyundai Department Stores and outlets will participate in the cashless initiative by the end of November, with Emart24 offering the service by early December.           The Bank of Korea (BOK) has been promoting projects to minimize the inconvenience of carrying cash. Under its initiative, it introduced a similar service to convenience stores and discount chains which deposits leftover change from offline purchases into T-money cards.           The new service could also benefit retail companies, as they would have to keep less cash on hand to give back as change. Industry watchers say this can help retail companies cut costs needed to manage cash.           Cash purchases are declining. According to a BOK report in March, Koreans held an average 53,000 won in their wallets last year. This is 27,000 won, or 34 percent, lower than two years ago.           Payments made on credit cards have been increasing. Credit card payments accounted for 43.7 percent of transactions made by the 2,650 people surveyed. This far exceeds cash, which was used for 26.4 percent of transactions.           BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
629,Samsung reportedly to make new Qualcomm 5G chip,"

                   Samsung Electronics has reportedly won the contract to manufacture Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 4-series chipset fitted with 5G compatibility, the latest in a series of high-profile deals for its chip-making business.           The tech giant recently won the order for the smartphone processing chip, due to be released in 2021, according to multiple local media outlets.             Samsung declined to confirm the news, saying that it is not allowed to reveal contract details.           Given that the chip will be used for budget smartphones from Chinese electronics companies Xiaomi and Oppo and U.S. smartphone maker Motorola, Qualcomm expects it to help bring the 5G networking standard into the mainstream.           “The Snapdragon 4-series 5G Mobile Platform is designed to exceed expectations for the mass-market segment by bringing an assortment of predominately high- and mid-tier features to a broader audience,” said Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon in a statement.             The 5G-enabled 4-series was first unveiled at IFA 2020, the biggest trade show in Europe that ran from Sept. 3 through Sept. 5.           The deal follows some huge agreements with other big-name players in recent days.           IBM announced last month that Samsung will be in charge of making its IBM Power10 processor, to be released in the second half of 2021, using its 7-nanometer extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography process.           Nvidia also said that the Korean firm will make its latest gaming chips based on Samsung's 8-nanometer process node.           Samsung laid out its ambitious plan last year to become the top player in the non-memory chip sector that includes chip fabrication, also known as the foundry business, putting aside 133 trillion won ($112 billion) for the goal.           Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) holds a firm grip in the chip-making sector with the majority market share. It is expected to claim 53.9 percent of the market in the third quarter, according to market tracker TrendForce, up 2.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.           Samsung is expected to control 17.4 percent, down 1.4 percent.             BY PARK EUN-JEE   [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]   "

631,New Deal Fund leaves market wondering and guessing,"

     Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki explains the New Deal Fund in Sejong. [NEWS1]               The market is mixed on the New Deal fund, a 20-trillion-won ($16.8-million) pool of money that will be used to finance the building of infrastructure for President Moon Jae-in's New Deal Policy initiative. It is the biggest fund ever issued in Korea. It is also a work in progress, with many questions hanging over it.           The JoongAng Ilbo answers a few of the frequently asked questions about the fund.             1. Is this the first of its kind?            The New Deal Fund is very similar to sector funds managed by private sector companies. As the name suggests, a sector fund invests in a certain industry, or sector. Some sector funds focus on the IT industry, others focus on consumer product manufacturers. The New Deal fund invests in private projects such as green smart schools, hydrogen-charging stations, digital social overhead capital and green energy.             The New Deal Fund has a master-feeder structure, where the investment in the parent fund is by the government and investment in the target infrastructure is made directly through feeder funds, raised and managed by private operators.             State-led funds with similar structures existed in previous administrations. There was the Green Growth Fund during the Lee Myung-bak administration and the Unification Fund under Park Geun-hye. Neither outlived the administrations that created it.               2. When can we start investing in them?          The Financial Services Commission (FSC) plans to begin gathering operators to manage the feeder funds next January. It will take until the second quarter of next year for the funds to be opened for public investment, as the government needs to select a management firm to run the funds and make necessary revisions to the law.           Some analysts are worried about the sustainability of the funds, as by the time the funds are opened for public investment, it will be just months away from the next presidential elections. The FSC believes investment will likely continue beyond the election as digital and the green economy are global trends.             “The Unification Fund during ex-president Park’s administration did not have a clear identity, and the Green Fund during president Lee did not have enough investment subjects since the market for environmentally-friendly investments were at its early stages of development. However, the New Deal Fund has a clear direction,” said one anonymous high-ranking executive from a public financial institution.             “But we still don’t know if the current government will stick to its original Green New Deal initiative,” said another industry source.                 3. What are the risks?          The New Deal Fund does not guarantee principal, so there is a chance for investors to suffer losses. The FSC also explained that “even though the public can invest in the funds, they should be responsible for the outcome.""             The risks might be lower than other funds, since according to the fund’s structure, the government acts as a subordinate investor that absorbs risk first. This is why many people have criticized the funds as an investment that profits the rich and makes up for any losses with taxpayer money. There was also confusion over exactly how much risk the government is willing to take. On July 3, FSC Chairman Eun Sung-soo said investors are “guaranteed principal of up to 35 percent” of losses. The government changed the numbers the next day to only 10 percent.              4. How much is the return?            The conclusion, is that we do not know how much losses or yields the fund will make until they are actually up and running.           “It’s hard for the FSC to give an exact estimate of yields, since the funds' structure will be different for each project,"" said one official from the FSC. “For an example, investments in data centers are likely to generate more returns so we will place more private capital into those funds, while we would put more public capital into funds for wind power generators, since those project are riskier than others.”             Chairman Eun said the yields on the funds will be a little bit higher than government ten-year bonds, which are currently around 1.53 percent. But the funds may not be able to fulfill the promised 3 percent returns, according to industry experts.             ""Since New Deal projects are backed by strong support from the government, it’s possible the funds could generate high returns in the short term. However, fund managers will have a hard time making aggressive investments since they will have to manage the funds under strict control from the government and under the burden of having to guarantee the principal,” said one fund manager.                 5. Will it attract a lot of investment?          The New Deal Fund will continue five years. Given that the money will be tied up for a long period of time and the yields are uncertain, experts say that the fund is not all that attractive.           Of the 20 trillion won, 13 trillion won will be invested by the private sector, most of which will be through financial institutions such as banks and pension funds. The FSC also predicts the total investment from the general public will reach only about 1 trillion won, considering the uncertain nature of the New Deal and its long investment period.           Its success is hard to judge. Considering what the government has laid out for now, it would be hard for the government to fulfill its initial goal of “moving the overflowing liquidity in the market from unproductive assets like real estate to productive ones.”           Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki predicts the funds will “function well this time.""                   6. Which stocks will benefit from the New Deal fund?          The government has yet to decide where it will invest the funds. Once an operating review committee gets established this year to evaluate the business performance and risks of the fund, it will review various investment destinations related to the New Deal presented by financial companies.           The New Deal Fund is heating up the market already. Shares of companies such as Unison, Hyundai Energy Solutions, Hyosung Heavy Industries and Hanwha Solutions surged after the announcement. Hana Financial Investment has selected 20 categories that might benefit from the funds.             The Korea Exchange announced Monday a ""New Deal Index” with 12 companies.           BY JANG WON-SEOK  [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]          Related ArticleGov't sets hopes high on New Deal investmentsNew Deal Fund is so good it might end up as a Ponzi scheme"

                  Embattled Eastar Jet said Monday it will reduce its workforce by more than half as part of efforts to find a new investor after Jeju Air scrapped its plan to acquire the smaller budget carrier amid the coronavirus pandemic.           Eastar plans to lay off 640 workers, or 53 percent, of its 1,216 employees on Oct. 14 before it begins the process of finding a new investor, Eastar Senior Vice President Kim You-sang said over the phone.           ""Our lead managers and two private equity funds [PEFs] want the company to reduce our fleet and workforce, among other things,"" he said.           The company plans to keep 576 employees, including cabin crew members required to fly six planes, the executive said.           Eastar currently has 18 planes, including two 737 MAX aircraft, and plans to reduce the fleet to five to seven planes.           Last month, Eastar selected Deloitte Anjin, Yulchon and Heungkuk Securities as lead managers to resume a bid to sell a 51.17 percent stake.           The company is looking for a strategic investor, or a company, that has an interest in the majority stake in Eastar, the executive said.           ""Ten companies, including PEFs, have expressed their intention to acquire Eastar. We are targeting to select a preferred negotiating partner by the end of this month,"" he said.           Eastar, which has suspended all flights since March, faces bankruptcy after Jeju Air scrapped the deal in late July due to the Covid-19 pandemic's growing impact on the airline industry.           In March, Jeju Air signed a deal to acquire the controlling stake in Eastar Jet from Eastar Holdings for 54.5 billion won ($45.53 million) as part of its expansion strategy despite the pandemic.           On July 1, Jeju Air sent an ultimatum demanding Eastar Jet pay off all of its debts, estimated at up to 170 billion won, including unpaid wages to its employees, delayed payments to subcontractors and office operating expenses, by July 15.           But Eastar failed to meet the demands. The company said the debt payment was not part of the deal and that it was not Eastar's duty to do so but Jeju Air's.           On July 23, state-run Korea Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Korea said they will withdraw their plan to extend loans worth 170 billion won to Jeju Air following the deal's collapse.           Yonhap   "

635,Are chaebol the answer to dodgy used-car dealerships?,"

     A used-car dealership in Yongdap-dong in Seongdong District, eastern Seoul. [NEWS 1]               A man in his 50s recently visited a used-car dealership in Bucheon, Gyeonggi, after seeing a two-year-old Hyundai Santa Fe advertised online for 9.5 million won ($8,000). Although the cheap price seemed suspicious, the dealership’s website looked legitimate.           When the man arrived at the dealership, employees immediately offered him other cars for even more competitive prices. Despite the obvious red flags, the price was so good that the man ended up signing a contract.            It wasn't until he was leaving in his new car and the staff admitted that he ought to have it inspected for faults within the next two months that the man realized how badly he'd been had.           “There were signs at every stage that this was a fraud, but as a consumer without perfect knowledge, I was helpless and became a victim,” he said.          Reports of fraudulent sales have spurred a debate over whether the proposed entry of conglomerates to the used-car market will be beneficial, or if the protection currently in place for small- and medium-sized businesses is still needed.           Last November, the Korea Commission for Corporate Partnership contested the designation of used-car dealerships as small- and medium-sized businesses that need protection from conglomerates. The commission delegated the decision to the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, but the verdict has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.            Existing used-car dealerships oppose the entry of major automobile conglomerates, saying that their businesses will be undermined by the arrival of much bigger players. Automobile manufacturers, however, say that conglomerates’ entry into the market is necessary to restore transparency and convenience for consumers, like that man in Bucheon.           The bulk of consumer complaints toward used-car dealerships are due to the lack of transparency demonstrated through fraudulent deals and scams.            According to a survey on consumers’ perception of the used-car industry last November requested by the Korea Economic Research Institute (KERI) and conducted by Mono Research, 76.4 percent of respondents view the market for used cars as dishonest and outdated.            The majority of people with such views gave a distrust in automobile quality and the occurrence of scams as major reasons. A recent investigation by the Gyeonggi Provincial Government into 31 online used-car dealerships showed that 95 percent of registered cars were fraudulent sales.           The used-car dealers say fraud is not that widespread, arguing that such sales are committed by just a few firms associated with criminal groups, not by any members of the official dealership association.           “There is no guarantee that crimes like fraudulent sales will stop when conglomerates enter the used-car market,” said Lee Kang-hee, a department head at the Korea Used Car Dealers Association.            Lee said the scams should be handled by law enforcement and monitored by local government, and they do not suggest systemic flaws in the industry.           Industry insiders also have a lot to say about the criticism regarding a lack of transparency.            “The background information on each car is accessible on the ‘Car 365’ website run by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The issue is a lack of awareness, not a lack of transparency,” said Ji Hye-sung, the secretary general of the Korea Federation of Used Car Dealers Association.               A number of imported car brands like Volvo are currently in the used-car dealership business. [VOLVO CARS KOREA]               Most of the background information of registered used cars is available for free, except for accident history — the Korea Insurance Department Institute charges for access to that information.           Questions have also been raised over whether dealerships deserve to be protected as small businesses considering their high turnovers. In response, those in the business say their sales are high due to the expensive price tags of cars, but their revenue still suits the requirements of a small business.           Whether the used-car industry deserves legal protection or not, it is undeniable that the local market is outdated. In the United States, there were 40.8 million used-car sales last year, 2.4 times the number of new-car sales. In Germany, the largest market in Europe, the size of the used-car market was twice that of the market for new cars.            In Korea, where shiny new cars are still seen as a status symbol for many people, only 2.24 million used cars were sold last year, just 1.2 times new-car sales.            The diversity in the markets in the United States and Germany contribute to the large number of used cars sold.            Korea only has a few types of used-car dealerships, but in the United States, the industry functions in multiple forms: There are car manufacturers that sell both new and used cars, independent dealers that only sell used cars, online dealers, wholesale intermediary firms and auctions for used cars. There are also derived businesses, such as information service firms and comprehensive solution firms that manage the inventory as well as customer service.            There are a number of firms that have attempted to sell authorized used cars in Korea, but they have not gone beyond uploading the information online, which is not enough to restore consumers’ trust in the market.           Major auto manufacturers like Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors say that their entry into the used-car market will serve as a benefit for consumers. Their belief is that by directly managing used cars, they can maintain the quality of the vehicles.           In the KERI survey, 51.6 percent of respondents agreed with conglomerates’ move into the market, while 23.1 percent opposed the idea.            “When an Avante breaks down, the consumers complain about Hyundai Motor, not the dealership that sold them the used car,” said an employee at Hyundai Motor. “The entry into the market is not for increasing sales, but for managing the brand’s reputation.”            With the advance of the electric vehicle (EV) era, automakers say that it is even more important that they directly manage their cars.            The EV maintenance network is weak compared to gasoline and diesel cars, and automakers are concerned that consumers will not be able to trust the EVs available on the market. Some point out that the local system discriminates against domestic brands, as imported car companies are allowed to run their own used-car authorization business.           Besides the concerns about the impact of the automobile makers’ foray into the used-car business, questions remain regarding how the assessment of used cars will be systemized.            There are also suspicions that the car manufacturers are eyeing the financial market for monthly installment payments. Many imported car firms are reaping huge profits from installment payments and leases of used cars. Hyundai Capital also runs a used-car business.           Industry experts say that there needs to be a solution that both improves the consumer experience and sustains the used-car business.            “Measures, such as a limit on the shares of major firms, must be established before allowing the entry of car makers into the used-car industry,” said Lee Ho-geun, an automotive professor at Daeduk University.            “Price increases are inevitable if companies like Hyundai and Kia enter the market. When that happens, the automakers will not be able to dominate the market, but the market will be divided. It can be an opportunity for market diversification. Setting the amount of shares and keeping the rate for 10 years could be one solution.”            BY PARK SUNG-WOO   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]   "

640,Rev. Jun back behind bars after bail is revoked,"

     Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon speaks to reporters Monday afternoon outside his home in Seongbuk District, central Seoul, shortly before taking a police vehicle to the Seoul Detention Center. [NEWS1]          Rev. Jun Kwang-hoon, the controversial pastor of a Presbyterian church that sparked Korea’s second-largest coronavirus outbreak last month, was placed behind bars again Monday after a local court revoked his bail.           The Seoul Central District Court formally accepted the prosecution’s request to detain the right-wing leader of the Sarang Jeil Church in Seongbuk District, central Seoul, 140 days after he had been freed from the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi.             The court’s decision came five days after the pastor was discharged from the hospital for coronavirus treatment. He was diagnosed with the virus on Aug. 17, less than a week after an infection was detected at his church, which immediately led to Korea's second-largest coronavirus hot spot.           By Monday at noon, the Sarang Jeil Church cluster had reached 1,163 cases, according to data compiled by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).           Jun, a scathing critic of President Moon Jae-in and his liberal government, is best known for his anti-Moon rallies in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul. He was placed under pretrial detention last February on charges of breaching election laws and slander against Moon ahead of the April general elections.             Seoul election authorities accused the pastor of allegedly calling on protestors during his street demonstrations to vote for conservative parties before the beginning of the official election period — the time during which it is legal to publicly electioneer. Jun was also accused of defaming Moon during the protests by calling him a North Korean “spy” and claiming he was trying to “communize” the country.           He was to face trial during detention.            Jun, however, was released on bail in April after complaining about his deteriorating health and paying 50 million won ($42,000) to the court. One of the conditions of his bail was that he not participate in any rally “connected” to his allegations.           Prosecutors saw that Jun disobeyed this rule on Aug. 15 when he joined the anti-Moon rally in Gwanghwamun, even as a cluster was growing inside his church community and health officials warned congregants not to attend the demonstration and stay home.             At one point of the rally, Jun stepped up to the microphone and accused the Moon administration of sabotaging his church.             Prosecutors asked the Seoul Central District Court on Aug. 16 to revoke Jun’s bail, but the court waited until he recovered from the coronavirus.           As Jun left his home Monday at around 3:35 p.m., flanked by police officers on his way to be detained, the pastor denounced Moon for running a “totalitarian country,” adding that the media were falsely reporting his church hampered government efforts to curb the spread of the disease.             The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office later said in a statement that Jun was officially jailed at the Seoul Detention Center at 4:30 p.m.           BY KIM SU-MIN, LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]   "
641,Samsung signs $6.6B deal with Verizon for 5G gear,"






     Samsung Electronics' 5G smartphone Galaxy S20 is put on display at the KT Square in central Seoul. [YONHAP]         Samsung Electronics signed a 7.9-trillion-won ($6.6-billion) deal to supply network equipment to U.S. telecommunications company Verizon, the company disclosed Monday in a public filing.           Under the contract, Samsung Electronics America will provide, install and maintain network equipment, mostly for 5G, for five years through December 2025.           It's the biggest single supply deal for network equipment ever landed by a Korean company.           Verizon is the largest wireless company in the world. Samsung's deal with the U.S. giant is significant in that it solidifies a foothold in a market that accounts for roughly 20 to 25 percent of global network equipment demand.           Samsung signed a 5G equipment supply deal with Verizon in 2018. That same year, AT&T and Sprint became 5G network equipment customers of the Korean company as well.           Analyst Lee Seung-woong of Hi Investment & Securities forecast in a September report that U.S telecommunications operators would start full-fledged investment in 5G networks starting from the fourth quarter of this year, with the market's largest players Verizon and AT&T in the lead.           According to the report, one issue that's been keeping them from expanding 5G coverage was a lack of a mid-band 5G spectrum, which is essential to ensure smooth 5G connection. After the U.S. government held its first auction for 5G mid-band spectrum in July, Lee predicted that the two leading companies would start huge investments in 5G.           ""The capital expenditures [capex] of Samsung's new clients, Verizon and AT&T, account for 60 to 70 percent of all U.S. telecommunication operators' capex. These companies increasing investment will help Samsung Electronics secure a significant foothold in the U.S. market,"" he wrote.           According to Lee's estimate, the number of cell towers needed for 5G is 1.2 times larger than the volume currently used for 4G network.           Prior to the rollout of 5G, Samsung's position as a telecommunications network provider was not as strong as its foothold in phones and chips. The company's breakout as a network equipment provider came in April 2019 when it took part in the launch of a 5G network with Korean mobile carriers.           In the past year, Samsung signed supply deals with other major telecommunications operators, adding Canada's Videotron, U.S. Cellular and New Zealand's Spark to its list of customers.           Last year, the company managed to significantly increase its market share in the global network equipment market, jumping to 23.33 percent from 5 percent in 2018, according to data from research firm IHS Markit. Over that period, Samsung jumped from fifth to third place in terms of world market share for telecommunication network equipment.            5G was one of the four future growth drivers Samsung Electronics targeted in 2018 when it announced a massive 180-trillion-won investment plan over three years.           The global leader in this market with more than a 30 percent market share is China's Huawei. But after the U.S. government accused Huawei equipment of security risks, a number of countries have shunned it. This will work in favor of Samsung, analysts say, allowing it to grow as a network equipment provider in the 5G era.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON   [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "
642,"Apink's Kim Nam-joo, Oh My Girl's YooA make their solo debuts ","

     Kim Nam-joo of girl group Apink, left, and YooA of Oh My Girl [EACH AGENCY]               Girl power to start autumn — Kim Nam-joo and YooA from popular girl groups Apink and Oh My Girl made their solo debuts on Monday, each with a different theme to charm listeners.            Both singers held online showcases on Monday afternoon, Kim for her single ""Bird"" and YooA for her EP ""Bon Voyage,"" and both took on the theme of setting out on a new journey as solo singers and showing new sides of themselves — but in two very different styles.              Kim Nam-joo poses for photos during her online showcase for ""Bird"" on Monday afternoon. [PLAY M ENTERTAINMENT]               For her solo debut, Kim went from pink to red.            Kim's ""Bird"" is based on a quote from the famed novel ""Damien"" (1919) by Herman Hesse, ""The bird fights its way out of the egg,"" to illustrate her first flight as a solo singer.            ""Members of Apink all have their own uniqueness and the team is complete when all those different colors come together,"" she said. ""I have been loved so much as a member of Apink, but I think there are limits to showing who I am as Kim Nam-joo while I'm part of a team. So for this new step, I'm half nervous and half excited.""            Composed by Soyeon, the talented leader of girl group (G)I-DLE, ""Bird"" is a powerful trap dance pop track that's very reminiscent of the dark-themed performances of (G)I-DLE, but interpreted in Kim's own style. It's far from the melodramatic romance theme that Kim has been donning as a member of Apink, but in no way does it mean that it doesn't suit her.            A lot of the focus went on the performance as well as the story line of the music video, during which she cuts her own hair to show her rebirth as a powerful female figure.           ""I wanted to express myself as a powerful Amazon that breaks free from the egg,"" said Kim during the showcase. ""I didn't include any other songs for this release, because I wanted to focus solely on this song and theme.""              YooA performs her lead track ""Bon Voyage"" during an online showcase held on Monday afternoon. [WM ENTERTAINMENT]               Compared to Kim, YooA's title track ""Bon Voyage"" is softer and dreamier and sees YooA transform into a nymph in the forest.            The lead track is a ""cinematic dance track"" that conjures up the mystical green of nature, with pluck sounds that create a fantastical and dreamlike mood. YooA dances in her iconic feather-light style that makes her look like a fairy on stage. The transition in the mood of the song comes in the drop part where the song takes on an exotic and dynamic melody with a chorus that backs her voice up.           ""There are seven members in Oh My Girl, and I've always thought that each of us are a color of the rainbow,"" said YooA. ""I don't think I can define who is which, but for this album, I think my color is an emerald hue like the image of the forest.""           As her title portrays, ""Bon Voyage"" is a song that celebrates her first journey as a solo artist. Just as Oh My Girl has been applauded by fans and critics for its step-by-step growth and maturity over the years, YooA also hopes to become an artist who develops step by step with each new move she makes.             ""Just like Oh My Girl, I want to mature in steps — not all at once. I want people to look forward to the next move and the next,"" she said.            YooA also suggests that listeners take a chance to listen to ""Far"" and ""Abracadabra.""           ""'Far' has a story line that's linked to 'Bon Voyage,'"" she said. ""You can listen to it before or after listening to 'Bon Voyage,' but you have to take in the lyrics. And for 'Abracadabra,' the lyrics are also important as well. You'll be murmuring 'Abracadabra' after listening to the song.""           BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
643,Trainee doctors going back to work Tuesday,"

     A mans stares at the registration sign at the Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul, a day before the 85th Korean Medical License Examination kicks off. The Health Ministry said Monday that the medical exam, already postponed once, will be carried out as scheduled despite only 14 percent out of 3,172 medical students having applied for it amid a boycott over increasing medical school admissions. [NEWS1]         Trainee doctors agreed to return to work Tuesday morning after fierce internal wrangling over whether to end their 18-day strike protesting controversial medical reform plans.           The Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) announced Monday afternoon that trainees will suspend their indefinite nationwide strike since Aug. 21 and return to their posts on Tuesday at 7 a.m. — for the time being.             However, KIRA demanded the government come up with measures to let medical students who boycotted their medical licensing exam, already postponed once, to apply for the test again.             After the government and Korean Medical Association (KMA) came to a truce last Friday, the trainee doctors were initially expected to return to their jobs Monday morning.           But late Sunday, KIRA issued a statement saying the trainee doctors would not return to work Monday after its members said their views were not sufficiently reflected in the truce last Friday.             The KMA reached a deal with the ruling Democratic Party and later the Health Ministry to suspend government plans introduced in July to increase medical school admissions by 4,000 students for the next decade starting in 2022 and to build a public medical school until the Covid-19 crisis subsides.             A young doctors’ emergency committee representing interns, residents and fellows on Thursday had generally agreed to the KMA deal the previous day.             But the deal, signed by KMA President Choi Dae-zip and Health Minister Park Neung-hoo, was criticized from some trainee doctors who claimed that the KMA had no right to reach an agreement to end the strike on their behalf.             Park Ji-hyun, the president of KIRA, who has served as head of the young doctors’ committee, said Sunday afternoon after holding a closed-door meeting that the trainees planned to end their strike without announcing the exact date.             KIRA announced late Sunday that trainees were not going back to work Monday morning.             The young doctors’ emergency committee held another meeting Monday afternoon on ending the strike, which has put a strain on emergency rooms and intensive care units and forced postponements of nonessential surgeries in major hospitals.             Park announced Monday afternoon that starting Tuesday, the trainee doctors will lower their collective action by one level, in effect halting their strike.             KIRA established a three-level road map that details their actions protesting the reform measures. Level 1, the lowest “close monitoring” tier, enables trainees to return to their jobs while still maintaining emergency committees at each hospital. Level 2, or “code blue,” calls for a partial walkout while maintaining only essential personnel to manage the Covid-19 situation. Level 3, “black out,” calls for a total strike although they can help with coronavirus treatment on a voluntary basis.           KIRA also warned that if no action was taken to support the medical students within two weeks, it could raise the warning level.           Medical students boycotting the Korean Medical License Examination missed the chance to sign up for the test again by midnight Sunday though the first round of the postponed exam was scheduled for Tuesday.           After nearly 90 percent of people signed up for the 2021 Korean Medical License Examination set for September and October canceled their applications en masse, with the first round set to kick off on Sept. 1, the government announced that it would be pushing back the exam by one week in a sign of compromise.             The Health Ministry said Monday that the state exam will be carried out as scheduled.             The organizers of the exam, the Korea Health Personnel Licensing Examination Institute, said that just 14 percent, or 446 applicants out of a total of 3,172 medical students, are taking it, with just 10 people expected to take it Tuesday.             “Our struggle has not ended, and we will maintain an emergency committee to hold a general strike again if compelled,” stressed Park.             However, Park and all other leaders of the emergency committee stepped down from their posts Monday afternoon amid continued backlash from young doctors, raising the question of whether the trainees will be able to return to work as planned. Some hospitals may individually hold votes overnight on whether trainees will return to their jobs.     Some fellows returned to their jobs Monday amid concerns over the prolonged disruption in hospital services.             Likewise, professors at Seoul National University Hospital urged their juniors to trust them and return to work in a statement, saying, “Now is the time to return to patients’ sides to carry out the fundamental responsibilities of doctors and regain the peoples' trust in order and enable them to listen to our voices better.”             BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
644,Lee In-young calls for 'small steps' to revive dialogue with North,"

     Unification Minister Lee In-young speaks at the Korea Global Forum for Peace, an event hosted by the ministry, on Monday. The event was broadcast live online. [UNIFICATION MINISTRY]               South Korea’s Minister of Unification Lee In-young on Monday called on North Korea to reciprocate Seoul’s inter-Korean exchange proposals, arguing that cooperation between the two Koreas could help revive denuclearization talks with the United States.             In an address delivered at the Korea Global Forum for Peace, a yearly event organized by the ministry, Lee noted the importance of incremental exchanges with North Korea in the fields directly affecting the public’s well-being, like public health, disease prevention and the environment.           “Small steps are better than no steps at all,” Lee said, quoting from Willy Brandt, the former West German chancellor who won a Nobel Prize in part due to his efforts in pushing his “Ostpolitik” brand of conciliatory policies toward the Communist East.           Calling on Pyongyang to respond to his proposal, Lee said it was the two countries’ ultimate task to usher in an age of “complete, verifiable, irreversible peace,” a reference to a phrase often used by U.S. officials to characterize Pyongyang’s denuclearization requirements.             Inter-Korean relations have all but ceased this year after Pyongyang escalated tensions with the South, owing to what it hinted was Seoul’s unwillingness to depart from a U.S.-led policy on sanctions toward the North.             As unification minister, Lee proposed using barter trades between the two Koreas as a means to build cooperation and trust, but Pyongyang has shown no response to the initiative.             Instead, Lee’s outspoken stance on the constraining influence of South Korea-U.S. relations on inter-Korean cooperation has irritated Washington.            In an awkward meeting with U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris last month, Lee openly called for the allies’ consultative body on North Korea policy to be revamped to accommodate Seoul’s independence in pursuing certain forms of exchanges with the North.             Another controversy was ignited last week when Lee remarked at a meeting with leaders of South Korea’s Protestant community that he believed Seoul and Washington could one day replace their “military, Cold War alliance” with a “peace alliance” down the road.           The U.S. State Department on Friday responded directly to the comment, stressing the two countries’ alliance went far beyond their security ties to include economic and human rights cooperation.             Moon Chung-in, special security advisor to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, on Monday said the State Department’s direct response to Lee betrayed Washington’s biased view of him, adding he could not understand why the United States was taking issue with the idea of a “peace alliance.”           Unification Ministry spokesman Yoh Sang-key also issued a formal response to the controversy, saying it was an “undeniable fact that the South Korea-U.S. alliance began as a military alliance in the Cold War, but developed into a value-shaped alliance on the basis of democracy and pursuit of a market economy.”           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
645,[NEWS IN FOCUS] Only question about Big Hit IPO is how big will it be?,"

     BTS performs at the MTV 2020 Video Music Awards. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               Big Hit Entertainment's initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for next month is expected to be a smash hit, with plenty of enthusiasm from retail investors for IPOs.           The only question is whether the valuation of the company behind K-pop phenomenon BTS accurately reflects the company's future potential.           Last week, Big Hit Entertainment led by chairman and CEO Bang Si-hyuk filed a securities registration statement with the Financial Services Commission saying it will issue 7.1 million new shares at a price between 100,000 won ($84) and 135,000 won per share. This is expected to raise between 748.7 billion won and 962.6 billion won and boost the company's valuation to up to 5 trillion won.           That is more than the combined value of SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment, the country's top three entertainment companies.           It is true that Big Hit has been doing better than expected this year, reporting 49.8 billion won in operating profit in the first half despite canceled concerts due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That figure is, again, more than the combined operating profit of its three rivals, which was 37 billion won in the first half.           Based on its first half earnings, the price-to-earnings ratio for Big Hit shares would be as high as 61 — depending on the IPO's eventual pricing — which is nearly double the figure for other entertainment companies, which average price-to-earnings ratios of between 30 to 35.              Bang Si-hyuk, the mastermind behind BTS, who is the chairman and CEO of the Big Hit Entertainment. [BIG HIT ENTERTAINMENT]               Some analysts, however, believe the price range for the IPO shares is too high.           EBest Investment & Securities has previously estimated the valuation of the company at 3.5 trillion won. Eugene Investment & Securities estimated the market valuation of the company to be 2 trillion won.           The company's heavy reliance on a single artist — BTS — is seen as one of its biggest risks.           According to its securities registration statement, sales generated by the seven-member boy band accounted for 97.4 percent of the company's sales last year. In the first half of this year, the percentage was 87.7 percent.           In order to overcome that dependence, Big Hit acquired two music agencies recently — Pledis Entertainment and Source Music — to expand its lineup with groups like Seventeen and GFriend.              Girl group GFriend is also under the Big Hit Entertainment label. [NEWS1]               The registration statement also warned future investors of the fact that BTS is comprised of male members born between 1992 and 1994 — all of whom are required to do military service in Korea. It said the oldest member, Jin, born in 1992, can postpone his conscription until the end of 2021 at the latest. It said it would fill his vacancy through preproduction of albums and videos — but admitted a possible negative impact on the company's profitability and growth potential.           Big Hit's other boy bands such as Seventeen and NU’EST cannot ignore the military service factor either, since their members were born between 1995 and 1999.           ""The military service issue always poses a risk with a boy band and the agency behind it,"" said Han Sang-woong, a researcher at Eugene Investment & Securities. ""Big Hit's reliance on BTS is big and the members' conscription could be a risk.""           Regardless, its IPO in October is expected to be a success.           ""There is some 58 trillion won worth of liquidity returned to retail investors who failed to get a share of the latest IPO jackpot, Kakao Games,"" said Lee Hyo-jin, a researcher at Mertiz Securities.           ""With no other viable investment options at the moment, demand for Big Hit’s IPO is going to be big.""           Demand for Big Hit Entertainment's shares being traded over the counter is already heated.           Dunamu, which operates an over-the-counter trading platform, said Big Hit ranked third last month in terms of how many people registered the company as an item of interest and how many times it was searched for.           The Dunamu platform on Monday showed that there were more than 2,000 inquiries about purchasing Big Hit shares with an asking price of more than 300,000 won per share.          BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Daejeon Jijok High School in Daejeon is closed Monday after a senior tested positive for the coronavirus. [NEWS1]         When central health authorities announced late last month that indoor gyms and fitness centers in the Seoul metropolitan area would close for a week amid rising coronavirus cases, Mr. Kim was devastated. The fitness fanatic suddenly had no place to work out — or so he thought.             Last Saturday, a day before the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures were originally supposed to be lifted, he went to Mount Gwanak in southern Seoul, and found an outdoor fitness zone.             Now, with the restrictions in place for at least another week, Kim, who’s in his 20s and refused to give his full name for this article, said he might go there more often until his gym reopens.           “I couldn’t stand the feeling of losing muscle, so I went to the outdoor fitness zone to work out, and I went really early to have the area to myself,” said Kim.             “At 6 a.m., there were still four to five other people. The equipment is worse than what I used to exercise with at my gym and there were a lot of mosquitoes and bugs. But since the social distancing measures have been extended, I’m planning to go again.”                            With Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi now in their second week of the Level 2.5 measures — and the rest of the nation subject to Level 2 measures in the three-tier system — many people like Kim have been taking their leisure and social activities outdoors, spending time alone or meeting their loved ones in open settings.           Twenty-nine-year-old Ms. Lee said she and her boyfriend visited the Gyeongui Line Forest Trail Park in Mapo District, western Seoul, last Saturday, a date she calls a recent trend.            “A lot of my friends have been dating outdoors lately, like in parks,” she said. Face masks are de rigueur.           Others who wish to stay indoors with their friends but have nowhere to go are flocking to motels that provide so-called “party rooms,” where up to nearly 10 people are allowed at a time. Such arrangements are perfectly legal.           “We receive nearly 30 calls a day asking if we have any empty party rooms,” said an owner of a motel in Sincheon, western Seoul. Last Sunday, the business said all its party rooms had been booked until Tuesday.             Korea added 119 new cases of the coronavirus Sunday, the fifth day in a row that daily figures fell below 200.             Eleven cases were imported, while the rest were local cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) revealed Monday morning: 47 cases were reported in Seoul, 30 in Gyeonggi, nine in Busan, seven in Gwangju, five in Daejeon, three each in Ulsan and South Chungcheong, two in South Gyeongsang and one each in Daegu and Incheon.             Of the imported cases, three each were from the Philippines and India, two from Turkey and one each from Japan, Algeria and Kyrgyzstan.             Two people died Sunday, bringing total deaths to 336, while 151 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 16,297.             By Sunday at midnight, there had been 162 patients who were either in serious or critical condition, and 21,296 coronavirus patients counted in all.           Several parts of the National Assembly premises in Yeouido, western Seoul, were shut down again Monday after a local news reporter covering parliamentary affairs was diagnosed with the virus earlier that day.

                           Workers walk to their offices carrying dosirak (packaged meals) in Yeouido, western Seoul, on Sept. 1. [NEWS1]          Unity against Covid-19 in Korea has given way to division as the costs of the country's highly effective measures have started to take their toll. Contact tracing is eroding privacy, work-at-home is taxing camaraderie while those suspected of having been in a coronavirus hot spot are facing discrimination.           Some are gripped by fear, as their companies are realizing that essential workers are actually very few.           A 48-year-old employee at a manufacturer worries about being the first confirmed case at his workplace.           “While small businesses, private law firms or private practices care less about shutting their businesses, big companies need to be shut completely when an employee is confirmed to be infected to the virus. Then, the infected person becomes the culprit of the closure,” he said. “I may get infected as well, but I hope I'm not the first one in my company.""             He is particularly concerned about his life being reviewed with a fine tooth comb if he is found to be infected, with his every move reconstructed and put into a database, some of it made public.           Being patient zero at a company is a fear shared by many. Their infection could lead to a major loss for the company, and they would be blamed.             Another 45-year-old man has also been doing all his work by phone instead of visiting his clients since the Covid-19 outbreak. The man said he never goes out to drink with his friends or even to the funerals of acquaintances.             “If I get infected with the virus at this age, the company would take some action that might be to my disadvantage,” he said. “There is nothing I can do but be very cautious so I don’t get infected by the virus.”             Growing fear about the coronavirus results in increasing distrust among people.             A man who currently works for a retailer said he is even reluctant to visit his company’s branch stores.             “Although I know that my company thoroughly disinfects its stores, I can’t guarantee that they are completely free from the virus as so many people visit and touch everywhere,” he said. “I used to have casual drinks with the parents of my kid’s kindergarten friends after work, but now we don’t trust each other anymore.”             A man who works for a financial firm was recently forced to take a week off even though he tested negative for Covid-19.             “I thought it would be okay because I tested negative, but it seemed like my colleagues no longer welcome me going to the office,” he continued. “It’s understandable, but it’s not like I committed a crime or something.”                        U-Space square of Pangyo Techno Valley, Gyeonggi, is unusually quiet after workers were ordered to work at home amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19. [YONHAP]         Remote working has become problematic as well. After many Korean companies ordered their employees to work from home, complaints started mounting over the side effects of the system.             Miscommunication and conflicts between team members are common these days as employees are only allowed to talk through text messages or online. Making the bad situation worse, as all kindergartens and schools have been closed, employees with kids at home find it difficult to concentrate.             Restructuring is a major concern.             “After the remote work was ordered, I was surprised how few people were actually needed to run the company,"" an executive at a large company said. ""This means that the company can possibly outsource the remainder in the future. Layoffs will become the next big issue.”             According to Mindroute Leadership Lab CEO Lee Kyung-min, who worked as a psychiatrist for over 20 years, Koreans must be ready to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, which may last for about two to three years.             “Instead of just thinking over and over again about the difficulty that you are facing, if you concentrate on what you can do during the hardship, it would make the difficulty less tough,” Lee said. “I recommend all to work normally and more positively despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, they will be given better opportunities in the future.”             Lee also emphasized that Koreans must face the reality.             “Even after the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation can never go back to how things used to be,” Lee added. “It is now time for Koreans to think more independently how they can survive not depending on their companies.”           BY LEE SO-AH, CHEA SARAH   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "
648,Could Seongnam's new striker be the next Hwang Ui-jo?,"

     Seongnam FC forward Na Sang-ho, front, celebrates after scoring his second goal during a match against Incheon United at Incheon Football Stadium on August 9. [YONHAP]          After just a few months with Seongnam FC, forward Na Sang-ho is already being called the next Hwang Ui-jo.           Na, who was a member of Korea’s U-23 national football team at the 2018 Asian Games, has earned the nickname “little Hwang Ui-jo” from Seongnam fans. Hwang, a Seongnam FC legend now playing for Bordeaux in France's Ligue 1, might just be the greatest striker the team has ever produced. Hopes are high that Na will one day take that title.           “I’m honored to be compared with Korea’s best striker,” Na said. “Ui-jo is my role model.”          Having joined Seongnam FC in June on loan from FC Tokyo, Na has scored four goals in 11 matches for Seongnam, immediately making him the highest scorer on the squad.           As of Monday, Seonganam is ranked eighth in the K League 1 with five wins, six draws and eight losses, totaling 19 points. Although they are in the second half of the 12-club K League 1 standing, they are still in contention to finish the season in the upper half of the split as they are currently tied in points and win-loss record with the sixth-ranked Gangwon FC and seventh-ranked Gwangju FC.            Seongnam is coming off a strong weekend, as they picked up a 2-0 victory against defending champion Jeongbuk Hyundai Motors at home at Tancheon Stadium in Seongnam, Gyeonggi.            The current leaders in the K League 1 are Ulsan Hyundai FC, who have picked up 14 wins, four draws and a loss, totaling 46 points — a good five points ahead of Jeonbuk.            Since Seongnam is competing for that sixth spot, the fans are especially pleased with the recent addition of Na.            “It feels even better that the fans recognize me,” Na said. “I will repay [the fans’] compliments all season long by scoring more goals.”           Switching to a different club mid-season and adjusting to their strategy is never an easy process. Although the fans and Seongnam’s head coach had high expectations for Na, they didn't want to pressure the young striker.            As it turned out, they needn't have worried. While it took Na a few games to adapt to his new club, he came into his own last month, scoring his first goal for Seongnam against Incheon United on Aug. 9.           Na also scored his second goal for Seongnam during that match.            “As a striker, I want to score goals every time I play,” Na said. “But as my struggle [to adapt] took longer than expected, I was getting worried. Thanks to my teammates’ encouragement, I was able to regain confidence.”           Na is desperate to live up to his ""little Hwang Ui-jo"" nickname. Hwang debuted with Seongnam in 2013, and after five seasons with the club, he signed with Gamba Osaka in Japan's J1 League.            Hwang was added to head coach Kim Hak-bum’s U-23 Korean national team roster for the 2018 Asian Games as one of three wildcards — older players permitted to join the squad. Hwang's inclusion was controversial at the time, as he wasn't seen as good enough for one of the coveted spots.           Hwang quickly silenced those critics, scoring nine goals throughout the tournament to lead Korea to gold. Nine goals was also good enough to win him the scoring title at the 2018 Asian Games.           That performance really put Hwang on the map, and he went on to become a regular on the Korean national football team, led by head coach Paulo Bento.             Last season, Hwang headed to Europe, joining Bordeaux Girondins.            Na has been on a similar path to Hwang. Back in 2018 when he played for the K League 2 club Gwangju FC, Na won the scoring title with 16 goals.          That performance earned him a spot on the U-23 national team for the 2018 Asian Games. By joining FC Tokyo last season, he also became one of the many Korean footballers playing in foreign leagues — and, like Hwang, his first stop was Japan.            “By spending time with Ui-jo throughout the Asian Games, I got to respect him,” Na said. “By getting through the K League 2, Seongnam and the Japanese league, I think I’m sort of following in his footsteps.”           Although the 24-year-old still has quite some way to go to become like Hwang, his priority is to get recognized as the “best” in the K League.             “My priority is to put Seongnam in the upper split,” Na said. “Personally, I hope to [finish the season with] two-digit attack points. Then, I want to be added onto the [national team for the] 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and then to head to Europe.”           Seongnam will continue its season with a match against Sangju Sangmu, the military club, at Sangju Civic Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 12, starting at 7 p.m.           The K League 1 will conclude its shortened regular season on Sept. 20. The league will then split into two halves. Seongnam is now competing to earn a spot in the top half, or Final A.           BY PIH JU-YOUNG, KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

Park Jae-ho of the ruling Democratic Party (DP) faced criticism Monday, after his Facebook account posted, and subsequently deleted, a pornographic video clip.             ""I don't know if it was hacked or not, but we deleted it yesterday,"" Park told the JoongAng Ilbo. He added that unintentional posts on other politicians' Facebook pages also ""happened before during the election campaign, so I told my aides to inform me if this happens frequently.""           Park is a second-term lawmaker of the DP, and represents Nam B District of Busan Metropolitan City.             ""I don't know if my aides made a mistake or pressed a wrong button.

It originated from a blog specializing in adult materials, and was deleted after about 10 minutes.             The video appeared to be pornographic material from a Southeast Asian country. It was posted with a Malaysian-language message, which roughly translated to, ""A girl asked for help but no one heard her.""            ""His office said the Facebook account is managed by an aide, not the lawmaker himself,"" Hwang Gyu-hwan, deputy spokesman of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), said Monday. ""They are just trying to avoid responsibility [...] Their explanations are all inappropriate. No matter what had caused this, they must first apologize.""             He added that the latest case should make the public wonder about the DP's commitment to eradicating the sex crimes committed by its politicians.           ""Park represents a constituency in Busan, and the people of Busan have already been seriously hurt by former Mayor Oh Keo-don's sex crime,"" Hwang said. Oh resigned on April 23 after revealing that he sexually assaulted an aide during a recent meeting.           ""The DP apologized and promised to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident, but Rep. Park's case and his handling of the situation are making us question the ruling party's sincerity,"" Hwang said. ""The DP also need to create an effective measure to prevent a recurrence of sex crimes by its politicians.""            BY SER MYO-JA, BAE JAE-SUNG  [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

[PARK SANG-MOON]               Recognizing Monday as the International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and embassies in Seoul called for global efforts to work with civic groups to combat greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and other air pollution crises.           “Today, Sept. 7, is a special day,” Ban Ki-moon, president and chair of the GGGI, said during his opening remarks for a climate change conference at the institution in central Seoul on Monday. ""Led by the Korean government, the UN General Assembly last year adopted by consensus the resolution to designate this day to help improve air quality, raise awareness of air pollution and acknowledge that air quality and climate change mitigation are very closely linked.""           He continued, “Active collaboration among government agencies, embassies, civil society groups and international organizations, like GGGI and the Green Climate Fund, are key to reducing air pollution and tackling climate change.""            The conference was joined by members of the “Blue Skies and Net Zero 2050 Campaign,” launched last December by GGGI and the Climate Change Center, which includes the embassies of Denmark, France, Britain, Canada, Italy and the Netherlands, along with the European Delegation in Korea and civic groups including Green Environment Youth Korea.             In addition to addressing the fine dust issue in Korea — Seoul ranked as one of the worst cities in terms of worst air pollution problems in 2017 — the campaign aims to request that the Korean government define its long-term strategy for the country to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.           ""Net-zero"" refers to removing greenhouse gas emissions at the same rate as they are being produced — typically achieved through a combination of aggressively cutting emissions and undertaking measures like forest restoration to offset those new greenhouse gases being introduced into the atmosphere.           The most recent government plan to address the issue — the so-called Green New Deal — does not specify annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions needed for Korea to go net-zero by 2050, a goal being adapted by many nations around the world, especially signatories to the Paris climate agreement.           Civic groups present at the conference Monday emphasized that Korea needs all hands on deck to reduce its emissions.             “I firmly believe that the Green New Deal will be led by the government but must be completed with civil societies,” said Yoo Young-sook, chairwoman of the board of directors at Climate Change Center, a nongovernmental organization on climate change in Korea. “The center will be sparing no effort to expand and strengthen the role of civil society [...] to successful implementation of the Green New Deal.”           It is also part of the campaign’s goals to outline a five-year Nationally Determined Conditions (NDC) target for the Paris Agreement in the lead up to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26) scheduled for 2021 in Glasgow. Korea has yet to submit its NDC target set through 2025, due at the end of this year.           “Korea is one of the world’s top-10 global emitters [...] Korean 2050 net-zero declaration will be an immense statement of leadership in raising the global ambition on climate change,” said Simon Smith, British ambassador to Korea. “COP 26 will be one of the last chances for the international community to mitigate damaging risks for climate change.”           BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]         "

[FOREIGN MINISTRY]         Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha will participate in a series of annual Asean meetings this week to discuss coronavirus responses and regional issues as Sino-U.S. tensions capture increased attention.             As in-person multilateral diplomacy has come to a halt amid the ongoing pandemic, Kang will take part in virtual talks involving the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other key players in the region from Wednesday through Saturday. The talks include the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), the East Asia Summit (EAS) and the Asean plus three meeting, involving Korea, China and Japan.             “We are making efforts to send out the message that it is crucial to bring back North Korea to dialogue,"" a Seoul Foreign Ministry official told reporters Monday. ""We are in talks to reaffirm international efforts toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and making substantive progress for a permanent peace regime.""            ARF is one of the rare regional security forums that North Korea regularly participates in, though it's unclear whether a Pyongyang diplomat will attend virtually this year.             The 10 Asean members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.             Vietnam is the host of this year’s Asean-related meetings.           The Asean sessions are also expected to be a platform in which the United States and China play out their ongoing rivalry in trade and security matters during the EAS on Thursday and ARF on Friday.             U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to take part in the Asean meetings and stress the importance of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and security in the Indo-Pacific region.           “I look forward to seeing my Asean and Indo-Pacific counterparts next week at a host of virtual meetings,"" Pompeo said during a press conference last Wednesday, noting he will discuss issues including Covid-19, North Korea and the Hong Kong situation.             “I’ll also raise how the Trump administration is restoring reciprocity to the U.S.-China relationship.”           In turn, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui said during a meeting last Friday that the United States is deliberately stirring up trouble in the South China Sea and stands in the way of peace and stability in regions. He called on the Asean countries to work together with China to safeguard regional peace and stability.             Luo made the remarks during a meeting with diplomats from Asean countries in Beijing, urging cooperation in East Asia, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.             He also noted that the United States, through its Indo-Pacific Strategy, introduced new policies related to the South China Sea, forcing Asean countries to choose sides between Washington and Beijing.             Washington has recently been urging its allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including Seoul, to partner with the United States against what it describes as political, military and economic aggression from China.             ""So whether it's our friends in India, our friends in Australia, friends in Japan or South Korea, I think they have all come to see the risk to their own people, to their own countries, and you'll see them partner with the United States to push back” against China, Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News on Sept. 1.             During the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum on Aug. 31, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun also indicated that the United States is looking to expand its Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, involving its regional allies Australia, Japan and India, along with other countries that share similar values.             He went on to specifically name South Korea, Vietnam and New Zealand as countries with which the United States is working closely on its Covid-19 response, in addition to the Quad countries.             Biegun said the seven countries, who are holding weekly meetings, are “very cooperative partners” and “a natural grouping of countries that really will do their very best to advance this combination of interests that we have in the Indo-Pacific.”           The U.S. special representative for North Korea elaborated that “while interests will drive all our nations to make choices in the policy sphere in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, shared values that complement shared interests create a solid foundation.”             He added that the “Quad isn’t exclusive” and “there’s plenty of reason to bring other countries into this discussion as well.”             Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun met with the ambassadors of Japan and China Monday in Seoul, while Kim Gunn, the deputy foreign minister for foreign affairs, held a videoconference with Alison Mann, director-general of the Asia Pacific Regional Integration Division of New Zealand’s Foreign Ministry.            Choi's meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Seoul Koji Tomita came amid a looming leadership change in Tokyo, as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced he will step down because of health problems last month.             Choi also later met with Chinese Ambassador Xing Haiming, after a senior Chinese Communist Party official visited Seoul last month confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping still plans to visit Korea after the coronavirus situation subsides.           BY SARAH KIM   [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]               "
653,Big Hit Edu aims to help global ARMY connect with BTS via Korean learning,"

     This image provided by Big Hit Edu shows ""Learn! Korean with BTS,"" a Korean-language learning kit featuring officially licensed content of K-pop giant BTS. [YONHAP]               Along with the global explosion of K-pop, the need among global fans to better understand what K-pop artists are singing, saying and writing in Korean has grown significantly.           The online edition of American business magazine Forbes highlighted in a recent article that many international fans of K-pop nowadays are turning to ""fan translators on social media platforms as the most accessible news source.""           The worldwide fan base of K-pop super group BTS — referred to as ARMY — is arguably at the forefront of this trend, as seen in cases of fan translation Twitter accounts such as @BTS_Trans, which has over 1 million followers eager to catch up on the global boy band's daily activities through translations done by fans.           Big Hit Entertainment, BTS' label-management company, recently began a new project that tries to tackle this issue at its core, by giving loyal BTS followers the tools to learn the Korean language itself — a learning package that uses officially licensed content of the seven-member K-pop act.           In an exclusive interview with Yonhap News Agency, Choi Yeong-nam, general manager of Big Hit Edu, Big Hit Entertainment's education subsidiary, explained that the company's new product, ""Learn! Korean with BTS,"" was designed specifically for those dedicated fans who are willing to take the ultimate leap: learn and study the mother tongue of BTS to have a deeper appreciation of the band.           ""'Learn! Korean with BTS' was designed for global fans of BTS who have difficulties enjoying K-pop music and content due to language barriers,"" Choi said in the interview conducted recently via email.           The package, comprised of four textbooks and a ""sound pen,"" which plays back the pronunciation of words of phrases by touching symbols on pages, was released on Aug. 24 and has seen a strong reaction — it was sold out in the United States in just 20 minutes and three hours in Japan, according to Big Hit Edu. The kit also includes a set of hangul computer keyboard stickers.           Co-developed by Big Hit Edu and the Korean Language Contents Institute at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS) for over a year, the package is designed for users to study hangul vowels, consonants and basic phrases based on Korea's regional traits and culture introduced in BTS' music and videos.           ""'Learn! Korean with BTS' is a study kit for those who want to learn a foreign language in trying to genuinely understand and communicate with someone,"" Choi explained. ""We developed the product with the emphasis on fans' wishes to better understand the artist and the artist's wish to better communicate with fans.""           Big Hit Edu has been uploading short videos every week related to the educational package since March on Weverse, Big Hit's online fan community-mobile commerce platform.           Last month, the company announced that it has partnered with the Korea Foundation, a nonprofit public diplomacy institution, and HUFS in producing a remote Korean-language course using ""Learn! Korean with BTS"" in overseas Korean-teaching institutions.           The first schools adopting the course starting this fall are Middlebury College in the United States, École normale supérieure and EDHEC Business School of France, Ain Shams University in Egypt and Vietnam's University of Languages & International Studies and Thang Long University.           ""Roles of the three partners are divided up respectively. Under the general leadership of KF, Big Hit Edu provides the study package to overseas universities and faculty of HUFS runs the courses remotely either live or prerecorded,"" Choi explained.           Choi said that a number of other overseas schools have also shown strong interest in the ""Learn! Korean with BTS"" program. ""We anticipate the number of participating schools and courses to increase consistently.""           The entry of Big Hit Edu, founded in November 2018, came at a time when demand for Korean learning had shown a steady increase worldwide, in line with the explosion of K-pop music and K-culture at large across the world.           According to a 2018 report by the Modern Language Association in the United States, the number of students taking Korean courses at American universities reached 13,936 in 2016, up 13.7 percent from three years ago, even when overall language enrollments decreased during the same period.           The number of King Sejong Institutes, state-run overseas Korean culture and language education centers, has jumped nearly tenfold in the past decade, from 23 in 2010 to 213 in 2020. The number of students as of 2019 stood at 72,713, showing a steep increase from the 4,301 tally from 2009.           According to the Korean Culture Ministry, Korean is the 14th most widely used language in the world as of 2019. The number of international applicants for the state-run Test of Proficiency in Korean (Topik) stood at 375,000 last year, reaching an all-time high.           To answer to the growing demand to learn Korean, the Culture Ministry announced that it will increase the number of King Sejong Institutes to 270 by 2022 and also introduce a certification system for Korean courses to ensure the quality of the programs.           Big Hit's differentiating factor, according to Choi, is the company's guiding principle, which aims to abandon preconceived notions of learning by using Big Hit artists as motivation to learn and study.           ""Most of those who want to study a foreign language nowadays tend to have very specifically defined goals: to either pass a test, to go abroad to study or to get a job. Hence the messages the language education companies send out are also very clear. They promise students that they can learn easily, fast and effectively,"" Choi said.           The corporate philosophy of Big Hit Edu, according to Choi, centers around asking what the consumer genuinely wants from its product and to provide a variety of solutions that meet those demands.           Big Hit Edu also communicates and works closely with the other subsidiaries of Big Hit Entertainment, Choi explained.           ""While the areas of specialty differ, we all use the same intellectual properties, and each subsidiaries' businesses integrates and converges with one another to create secondary and tertiary services.""            Choi said Big Hit Edu is keen on listening to the feedback and opinions of customers and plans to add ""new methods, structures and elements that are deemed most effective and useful"" in follow-up learning packages.           Having majored in education from Seoul National University, Choi joined the online education venture business after graduating and later managed a project in developing an online language learning program using cutting-edge technology at Etoos Academy, the largest online learning company in South Korea.           As a seasoned veteran in the online education industry, Choi said his goal is to lead Big Hit Edu in becoming the leader in the educational technology industry.           ""We are living in an era where everything changes at unexpected levels and speeds,"" Choi said.

     Tribons’ online shirts customizing platform Shirts Specter not only asks questions related to size, such as the lengths of the neck, shoulders, chest and waist, but also allows consumers to customize detailed designs for the collar, pocket and cuffs. [SHIRTS SPECTER]         Most consumers believe ordering bottled water online poses a much smaller risk than ordering a pair of pants that may or may not fit. But the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and big data technologies is helping consumers have a much better experience when it come to shopping for clothes online.          As the Covid-19 pandemic persists, people are shying away from visiting stores and dressing rooms and instead turning to the internet.            Mobile research platform Open Survey released the ""2020 Mobile Shopping Trend Report"" on Aug. 3, which studied 1,000 consumers aged between 20 and 49 for three months and how their shopping tendencies changed amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The report showed that online and mobile purchases of food increased by 15 percent, while purchases of fashion items increased by 4.2 percent in the past three months.               Tribons’ online shirts customizing platform Shirts Specter not only asks questions related to size, such as the lengths of the neck, shoulders, chest and waist, but also allows consumers to customize detailed designs for the collar, pocket and cuffs. [SHIRTS SPECTER]         Ordering a customized shirt may seem like a high-end tailor shop service, but now online consumers can make such purchases from the comfort and safety of their own homes by answering some basic questions. They will receive their custom, tailored shirt within seven days.           Tribons, which officially imports men’s shirt brands such as DAKS and Jill by Jill Stuart, developed Shirts Specter with the accumulated data of one million Korean men’s body patterns based on their history of returns and repairs.            ""We spent more than a year developing and building an AI-based size measurement system in search of patterns suitable for the average size of Korean men,” Kim Hak-il, head of the business division of Tribons, said. “We measure beyond just the arm length or shoulder length, but whether their shoulders are slightly curled inward or their backs are bent forward."" In addition to size, consumers can choose detailed designs such as for the collar, pocket and cuffs.                Tribons’ online shirts customizing platform Shirts Specter not only asks questions related to size, such as the lengths of the neck, shoulders, chest and waist, but also allows consumers to customize detailed designs for the collar, pocket and cuffs. [SHIRTS SPECTER]         There are eight questions that Shirts Specter asks, which include age, height, weight, preferred fit and the consumer’s usual shirt size. It doesn’t ask for exact tape measures of arm length. Using big data, Shirts Specter can analyze consumer language such as ""I am skinny but have a muffin top,"" or “my arms are long relative to my height” and translate it into actual figures.           No matter how convenient online shopping is, buying shoes online is often overlooked as consumers want to try their footwear before buying.                Perfitt, an online shoe shopping platform, uses the 30,000 to 40,000 pieces of size data collected from 40 major shoes brands and AI-based size recommendation technology to recommend the best shoe size for each consumer’s feet. [PERFITT]         Perfitt, an online shoe shopping platform, recommends shoes that fit each consumer’s feet size by using size measurement data and AI-based size recommendation technology. Consumers can still buy shoes without registering their shoe sizes, but the customer satisfaction level of purchasing shoes after registering their size is more than 90 percent, and the return rate is as low as 0.9 percent, according to the CEO of Perfitt, Lee Sun-woong.           ""As the e-commerce market is growing continuously, shoe companies are starting to expand their online business,"" Lee said. ""AR tools that recommend the perfect fit for consumers have been introduced in global fashion companies, including Nike Fit in the United States and Rakuten Fits Me in Japan.""            To get a size recommendation, a consumer simply needs to place both feet on the size measurement kit provided by Perfitt, take a picture and upload it to the Perfitt app. Based on the data of 150,000 customers and 30,000 to 40,000 size data from 40 major shoes brands that Pefitt has collected, its sizing recommendation technology provides the best fit. The service is limited to sneakers but the company is planning on expanding the category to heels, which are more sensitive to size.               Lologem’s virtual jewelry try-on platform Lolo Looks allows customers to try on and purchase jewelry online.

657,Typhoon Haishen lashes southeastern coast,"

     Intense waves brought by Typhoon Haishen batter Busan's Gwanganli Beach on Monday. [YONHAP]               Typhoon Haishen rampaged its way across Korea’s southeastern coast Monday, hammering Busan, Ulsan and coastal Gangwon with intense rains and winds as it made its way northwards.           Defying predictions a day earlier that the storm would narrowly skirt the peninsula, Haishen made landfall near the city of Ulsan Monday morning, packing powerful winds measuring up to 35 meters per second (78 miles per hour).             By 3 p.m., the storm exited eastern Gangwon around 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Gangneung and was back in the East Sea, moving north and due for a second landing in North Korea’s North Hamgyong Province Tuesday morning.           With pressure at its center measuring around 965 hectopascals, the storm was moving at a speed of around 32 meters per second at noon on Monday, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).           Like Typhoon Maysak before it, Haishen wreaked havoc in coastal cities of eastern Korea, causing damage to hundreds of properties due to heavy rains and winds.           No casualties were reported as of Monday afternoon, but a 44-year-old man went missing in Samcheok, Gangwon, that morning after returning from mining limestone at a rural location.             According to city authorities, the man slipped into a flooded drainage system and was swept away by waters. Emergency personnel were still searching for the man by press time on Monday.             Eastern Gangwon, where Samcheok is located, experienced around 30 to 60 millimeters (1.2 to 2.4 inches) of rain per hour, which in turn caused landslides throughout the mountainous region that blocked roads and flooded neighborhoods.             Up to 400 millimeters of rain were expected in the area through Monday and Tuesday, the KMA said, along with winds measuring at around 25 to 40 meters per second — strong enough to knock over an adult.             The KMA issued a storm surge warning in 10 locations along the coast of the East Sea in Gangwon Tuesday due to sea levels elevated by the typhoon. Yangyang and Goseong Counties, as well as the cities of Samcheok, Donghae, Gangneung and Sokcho, were vulnerable to surges through Monday evening, the agency warned.             Busan, too, experienced fierce winds at a speed of 32.2 meters per second, while the coastal city of Pohang, North Gyeongsang, was hit by winds measuring up to 42.3 meters per second.           Throughout the Gyeongsang region, a total of 17,620 households experienced varying degrees of blackouts as a result of the storm, and more than 6,000 had yet to regain power by Monday afternoon.              Flooding along the banks of the Taehwa River in Ulsan, due to rains brought by Typhoon Haishen on Monday. [YONHAP]               Hyundai Motors’ plant in Ulsan experienced a power shortage, halting all operations there Monday.           At least 1,640 people had to be evacuated from homes, while a total of 5,882 schools throughout the region suspended classes for the day, or carried them out online.             Various reports of falling trees, road signs and traffic lights were made in Gyeongsang, while intense winds shook buildings in Busan’s wealthy Haeundae District.           Train services throughout most of the southeast were suspended Monday morning but resumed in the afternoon. Likewise, all flights in and out of Jeju Island were canceled throughout the morning.             With the worst of the storm having passed by 4 p.m., the KMA lifted typhoon alerts in Busan, Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, and North and South Jeolla. By 5 p.m., storm alerts were lifted from North Gyeongsang, Daegu, and the Chungcheong region.             Greater Seoul, which experienced rains and winds of a lower intensity than the country’s southeast, had its typhoon alert lifted at 3 p.m.              A car swerves on the road in Gangneung, Gangwon, on Monday. The area was hit by intense rains measuring up to 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) due to Typhoon Haishen. [YONHAP]               Haishen’s rampage throughout the peninsula was the latest in what is shaping out to be one of the most destructive series of natural disasters in recent memory in Korea.             After a record-long rainy season through early August that caused immeasurable damage, the country was affected by back-to-back typhoons in Bavi from Aug. 25 to 27 and Maysak from Sept. 1 to 3 before Haishen’s arrival on Sunday to Monday.             The season’s 11th typhoon — Noul — has yet to form, but already fears are rising that Korea may be hit by it.           Last autumn also broke records by becoming the first time Korea was hit by three typhoons consecutively throughout September and October — a feat that has repeated itself this year.             Meteorologists warned that relatively warm sea level temperatures and high-pressure areas in the atmosphere prevalent in the region meant that conditions were ripe for additional typhoons to form in the Pacific Ocean.           BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "

659,PPP demands special prosecutor to probe allegations against Choo,"

     Kim Chong-in, acting leader of the main opposition People Power Party (PPP), speaks during a party meeting on Monday. Kim demanded that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae over allegations that she abused power to arrange special treatment for her son during his 2017 military service.  [YONHAP]                The main opposition party on Monday demanded a special prosecutor be appointed to conduct an independent probe into Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae over allegations that she had abused her power to arrange special treatment for her son during his military service.            “This is not a case of parental love for a son that had gone wrong,” Kim Chong-in, acting chairman of the People Power Party (PPP), said during a party meeting in the morning. “Doing nothing about this scandal is an act of insulting and destroying rule of law.”             Kim called on Choo to immediately step down as more suspicions were raised that she arranged favors for her son during his military service in 2017. Choo has consistently denied the allegations.                Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae attends the National Assembly's plenary session on Monday.  [YONHAP]                Choo’s son, surnamed Seo, served his military duty in the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, or Katusa, for the 2nd Infantry Division of the U.S. 8th Army from November 2016 through August 2018. Opposition lawmakers have alleged that Seo was let off the hook when he went AWOL in June 2017.             Based on anonymous statements provided by military supervisors of Seo, PPP Rep. Shin Won-sik said last week that Choo’s aide had requested an extension of Seo’s medical leave when he failed to return to the base in time. At the time, Choo was the chairwoman of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), and Shin said Choo abused the power of her office to intervene on her son's behalf.             Shin, a former lieutenant general who once served as the deputy chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added to the allegations on Sunday, accusing top administration officials and the legislature of trying to influence a selection process of military interpreters for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in February 2017 to grant a post to Seo.             Shin said an Army colonel in reserve, who had served as the commander of the Katusa forces, told Shin's aide that he was pressured by the office of the defense minister and the liaison office at the National Assembly to dispatch Seo as an interpreter to the sports event. The colonel, whose surname is Lee, said he had resisted the pressures to ensure fairness.            Serving as an interpreter at a global sports event is considered a rare, prestigious opportunity. Competition was fierce among Katusa soldiers to perform the mission, which would likely bolster their resume. At the time, the Army dispatched 65 soldiers as interpreters.             According to Lee, outside pressure was high to name Seo as one of the interpreters, but he resisted.             “He wasn’t assigned,” Lee told Shin’s aide. “Many requests were made from the office of the defense minister and liaison office of the National Assembly, but I said during a meeting that this will later become a problem [...] I changed the selection method to drawing lots.”           As a result, Seo was not selected, even after additional requests were made, Lee added.           Seo’s lawyer, Im Ho-seob, told the JoongAng Ilbo on Sunday that he has no information about the allegation.           Meanwhile, Seo released three medical records concerning his controversial medical leave. One of them was a doctor’s note from June 21, 2017, which was used to extend his medical leave.           Seo took his first medical leave from June 5 to June 14 in 2017 and the second one from June 15 to June 23. Without returning to the base, he used personal days off from June 24 to 27.             Opposition politicians, lawyers and military sources said they have no doubt that Seo underwent medical procedures during those periods. They said the controversy is focused on how he was able to extend the medical leaves without going through proper channels, and that Seo was attempting to divert attention from the issue.             The PPP said Monday that Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl must appoint a special prosecutor to conduct an investigation into Choo. The Seoul Eastern District Prosecutors’ Office has been investigating suspicions surrounding the medical leave since February, but no progress has been made.           The special prosecutor system is an extraordinary protocol for a criminal investigation. When the prosecutor general appoints a special prosecutor, he or she is exempt from making interim reports to their bosses. The special prosecutor reports only the final outcome of the probe to the prosecutor general.             The system was introduced in 2010 and has been used four times — in each case, to investigate a prosecutor.             “This is déjà vu from the Cho Kuk scandal from last year, where the fairness of college admissions was destroyed,” PPP’s leader Kim said Monday. “Our youngsters want a society where everyone is equal in front of the duty to defend the country by serving in the military.”                   BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "

Completion is aimed for 2023. Kakao’s data center will be “hyperscale,” holding 120,000 servers with a total data storage capacity of six exabytes, or 6 billion gigabytes, the company said.           This will be the first data center for Kakao, Korea’s second largest IT firm by market cap behind Naver. Data centers hold core infrastructure for such companies as the physical base for servers, network equipment and data storage.             Naver currently has a data center in Chuncheon, Gangwon. Kakao, on the other hand, had outsourced data storage facilities since it started in 2006 until recently, as its business expanded into realms like finance and games.           “For us, this data center will give us a stable foundation for our research and development in technology like big data and artificial intelligence,” said a Kakao spokesman. “With it, we can also strengthen our knowledge of data management.”           An affiliate specializing in IT solutions for corporate clients, Kakao Enterprise is preparing to launch a corporate cloud service, for which a Kakao-run data center would be important.           The Korean IT firm said it would include eco-friendly features in the data center, such as using systems to monitor water and electricity consumption and using collected rainwater. The latest innovations will be used to minimize damage in case of emergency blackouts.           On Monday, Kakao and Hanyang University executives and officials from the Gyeonggi and Ansan governments got together to sign an agreement for the project. Last year, the Ansan Science Valley, where Kakao’s data center will be built, was designated to become a “technological innovation cluster” by the government. The plan is to continue cooperation between the three parties to boost infrastructure on artificial intelligence, big data and cloud businesses.           “Our goal is to establish the best data center in the IT industry in terms of stability, efficiency and security.

Subscriber numbers have been increasing on year since May.           In manufacturing, the number of new subscribers has declined. When compared to the same period last year, the number of people in manufacturing subscribing to employment insurance was down 63,000 in August.           The number of subscribers in manufacturing has been declining on year every month since last September.           Declines in subscriber numbers were greatest in the electronics and telecommunications and automotive categories.           In August, 128,000 fewer electronics and telecommunications workers subscribed to the insurance, and 107,000 fewer automotive workers.           In services, 314,000 new subscribers were added in August on year, which is up from July's 237,000.           Online shopping and other retail businesses benefited as social distancing resulted in a need for more workers.           Fewer young people are subscribing, while more older people are signing up as the number of government jobs for the elderly have been increased.           In August, 59,000 fewer people aged 29 or younger subscribed to employment insurance, while 52,000 fewer among those in their 30s subscribed. In the 60-and-over category, 208,000 more people subscribed to employment insurance.           The government expects the unemployment situation to worsen this month as the impact of the resurgence is likely to be felt in September.             BY HAN NAM-HYUN   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
663,BTS's feat of topping Billboard Hot 100 to see economic effect of 1.7 trillion won,"

     BTS               The estimated economic effect of BTS having topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for the first time for a Korean act is 1.7 trillion won ($1.4 billion), the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said on Monday.            BTS topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on Sept. 1, in the United States, with its latest English digital single ""Dynamite"" released on Aug. 21.             According to the ministry, the estimate came from the Cultural Industry Research Center within the Korea Culture & Tourism Institute, which calculated the economic effect of the new achievement by taking into account factors such as the sales volume of BTS's agency Big Hit Entertainment, the input-output table published by the Bank of Korea and the import and export data from Korea Customs Service and the Google Trends search count.            The revenue from ""Dynamite"" was estimated at 245.7 billion won, while export volume of related goods — such as cosmetics, food and apparel — was expected to reach 371.7 billion won.           Production-inducing effects of 1.2 trillion won, value-added inducement effects of 480.1 billion won and employment-inducing effects of employment opportunities for 7,928 people are also expected.            The numbers did not take into account the effects that would have been created by tourism revenue due to Covid-19, which prohibits any concerts or overseas tours from taking place, nor the income from concert tickets that would have been made during offline concerts and national tours.            ""The economic effects are expected to heighten even more if we were to take these factors into account afterwards, as well as the effects they will have on our national image and brand value,"" the ministry said.            Korea also jumped up a step on the Global Innovation Index announced by United Nations subsidiary World Intellectual Property Organization on Sept. 2, from No. 11 to No. 10 this year.            This is the first time for Korea to make it to the top 10 and also the second highest in Asia after Singapore on No. 8, ""Thanks to remarkable achievement made by Hallyu [Korean Wave] content such as film 'Parasite' [2019],"" according to the ministry.            ""This analysis was made to show that BTS's accomplishment has enormous economic effects as well, but their feat goes beyond simple numbers,"" said Culture Minister Park Yang-woo.           ""Their music has become a remedy to people all over the world suffering due to Covid-19, and they have become a national pride once again.""           BY YOON SO-YEON   [yoon.soyeon@joongang.co.kr]   "
664,Machado is second foreign player ever to top All-Star vote,"

                  The Lotte Giants' shortstop Dixon Machado has topped the All-Star fan voting, becoming only the second foreign player to do so in the KBO.           The KBO unveiled 12 starters for each All-Star squad on Monday, and Machado, the first-year Venezuelan player, led everyone with 849,441 votes. He joins former Giants' star Karim Garcia (678,557 votes in 2008) as the only non-Korean players to win fan voting.        Dixon Machado of the Lotte Giants [YONHAP]               In late July, the KBO announced plans to hold All-Star voting even in the absence of the actual game in order to keep fans engaged and give them a chance to show their support for their favorite players.           The All-Star Game had been scheduled for July 25 but was canceled for this year. The start of the regular season was pushed back by more than a month to May 5 due to the coronavirus outbreak, and in an attempt to squeeze the usual 144 games into a tighter calendar, the league decided to scrap the All-Star Game.           Machado is batting 0.291/0.361/0.447 with nine home runs and 51 RBIs this year, but it's been his defense that has turned heads across the KBO and endeared him to the Giants' fans. With Machado providing highlight-reel plays and offering much-needed stability up the middle, the Giants are trying to return to the postseason after finishing dead last in 2019. They are 5.5 games back of the final playoff spot after the weekend's action.           The All-Star teams are the Dream Team, made up of players from the Doosan Bears, SK Wyverns, KT Wiz, Samsung Lions and Lotte Giants, and the Nanum Team, with players from the Kiwoom Heroes, LG Twins, NC Dinos, Kia Tigers and Hanwha Eagles.           The 12 positions to be filled are: starting pitcher, middle reliever, closer, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, right fielder and designated hitter.           The top vote-getters at each position will wear an All-Star patch on their uniforms the rest of the season.           For the Nanum Team, the Heroes' outfielder Lee Jung-hoo was the top vote-getter with 831,755. Machado and Lee will each receive 1 million won ($840) for leading their squad in votes, and 22 other All-Stars will get 500,000 won each.           Joining Machado on the Dream Team are starting pitcher Dan Straily (Giants); reliever Koo Seung-min (Giants); closer Kim Won-jung (Giants); catcher Kang Min-ho (Lions); first baseman Kang Baek-ho (Wiz); second baseman Kim Sang-su (Lions); third baseman Choi Jeong (Wyverns); outfielders Mel Rojas Jr. (Wiz), Kim Jae-hwan (Bears) and Son Ah-seop (Giants); and designated hitter Jose Miguel Fernandez (Bears).           The Nanum Team members other than Lee are starting pitcher Koo Chang-mo (Dinos), reliever Park Jun-pyo (Tigers), closer Cho Sang-woo (Heroes), catcher Yang Eui-ji (Dinos), first baseman Kang Jin-sung (Dinos), second baseman Kim Sun-bin (Tigers), third baseman Kim Min-sung (Twins), shortstop Kim Ha-seong (Heroes), outfielders Kim Hyun-soo (Twins) and Preston Tucker (Tigers) and designated hitter Na Sung-bum (Dinos).           The Giants produced the most All-Stars with five, followed by the Dinos with four and the Heroes and the Tigers with three each. The Hanwha Eagles were the only club without an All-Star starter.           Of note, Kang Min-ho earned his 10th All-Star starting nod, and Kim Hyun-soo has been voted in for his sixth consecutive All-Star team.           Yonhap   "
665,Small businesses are vanishing by the thousands,"

     Shops' shutters are closed in the once-popular tourist destination in Myeong-dong, central Seoul, on Aug. 31 as many of the small businesses are struggling to make ends meet amid the resurgence of the coronavirus. [YONHAP]               Small businesses are being devastated by the pandemic, with the mom-and-pops, restaurants, travel agencies and similar establishments going out of business at a rapid rate, according to recent statistics.             The situation is set to worsen as the government over the weekend has extended the social distancing orders that have hit food-and-beverage outlets especially hard.               Many small businesses were already on the ropes before the pandemic, and the crisis has made an already bad situation worse. Owners are becoming desperate, with at least one suicide being reported related to the financial stress faced by a small business operator.               The number of small shops in Seoul dropped 5.4 percent in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter, according to a report by Budongsan 114 based on a study by the Small Enterprise and Market Service (Semas). The total reported was 370,321, meaning 21,178 small stores that existed at the beginning of the year are now gone.           Over the same period, 10,040 restaurants went out of businesses, a 7.5 percent decline on quarter. The number of hair salons dropped by 3,473 stores, a 5.1 percent decline. In the travel agency, leisure and entertainment — which includes noraebang, or singing rooms — and computer cafe category, 1,260 businesses shut for good, a 10.8 percent decline.           The Korea Development Institute (KDI) believes that the recent resurgence of the virus in Korea will lead to more economic troubles down the road.           In a report, the state-financed think tank said prior to August the situation was starting to improve, but due to the rise in new daily case numbers in August and the implementation of enhanced social distancing measures, services are likely to face significant challenges.             It noted that credit card spending between Aug. 19 and Aug. 30 was down 12.1 percent year-on-year, similar to the 14.2 percent drop between Feb. 19 and May 5 when Covid-19 numbers were peaking.           The KDI said that many business run by the self-employed are on the verge of failure, so another round of emergency relief grants needs to be disbursed immediately.           The Blue House, the government and the ruling Democratic Party on Sunday agreed on a 7-trillion-won ($5.9-billion) fourth supplementary budget. It will include a round of emergency relief that will be provided to businesses run by the self-employed, lower income households and the unemployed.             Freelancers, including door-to-door sales people, are also expected to receive the grants.           The goal is to disburse the funds before the Chuseok holidays, which start at the end of this month.             The first emergency relief grants where distributed in May to every Korean household, which received between 400,000 won and 1 million won in one-time support.           Although the details have not been disclosed, it has been reported that the government is looking into granting up to 2 million won to the self-employed and small business owners.           BY LEE HO-JEONG   [lee.hojeong@joongang.co.kr]   "
666,Samsung inks ₩7.9 trillion deal with Verizon,"

     Samsung Electronics' Seocho headquarters in Gangnam, southern Seoul. [YONHAP]         Samsung Electronics signed a 7.9 trillion won ($6.6 billion) deal to supply network equipment to U.S. telecommunications company Verizon, the Korean IT firm disclosed Monday in a public filing.    Under the contract, Samsung Electronics America will provide equipment, including for 5G connections, to Verizon for five years through December 2025. By volume, it's the biggest single supply deal for network equipment ever secured by a Korean company.             Samsung had worked with domestic mobile carriers last year to make Korea the first country to commercialize 5G connections. After 5G debuted April 2019, the company has signed network equipment supply deals with major telecommunications operators, including Canada’s Videotron, the U.S.'s Cellular and New Zealand’s Spark.             The largest wireless company in the United States, Verizon is also the largest in the world.           Prior to the rollout of 5G, Samsung’s presence as a telecommunications network provider was not as strong as its foothold in phones or chips. The company managed to significantly increase its market share last year, jumping to 23.33 percent from 5 percent in 2018, according to data from research firm IHS Markit.           BY SONG KYOUNG-SON  [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]   "

668,GM waxes Lyriq-al about Korean partners,"

     Cadillac's first pure electric vehicle Lyriq. [CADILLAC KOREA]               General Motors’ electric vehicle (EV) strategy relies heavily on its technological partnership with Korean battery maker LG Chem, according to an online global roadshow held by Cadillac through Zoom on Sept. 4.           Cadillac is a luxury arm of the Detroit-based automaker.           GM also empathized the extensive supply base that Korea has, ranging from battery technology to electronics parts for GM's connected vehicles.           “I can’t say enough about the supply base in Korea and their support for GM for many years,” said Steve Kiefer, president of GM International, during the online presentation.           “[The] joint venture [with LG Chem] will really produce the world’s best and most efficient and cost-effective battery cell and we are really excited about the partnership.”           Last year, GM and LG Chem formed a 50-50 joint venture investing a total of $2.3 billion to mass-produce battery cells for the auto company’s future EVs, including building a new manufacturing site in Ohio.           Out of 100 to 130 suppliers that the U.S. automaker recognizes every year for being the “best supplier,” Steve said 30 percent have regularly been based in Korea including LG Electronics, which is in charge of in-vehicle safety and security systems for GM vehicles.           The Cadillac team during the online global roadshow also presented blueprints for its first-ever pure electric vehicle Lyriq, which it will start mass-producing from late 2022 at the earliest.           When asked about its belated entry into the market, Steve said “bringing the vehicle when they are ready” is more important than bringing it faster than its competitors.              Frontal look of the Lyriq. [CADILLAC KOREA]               “When we see the Lyriq, we often say this isn’t just a great electric vehicle but it is a great vehicle,” said Kiefer.            “We are confident that from market timing, when our customers see the vehicle and drive and feel the performance, they will come to the brand very quickly.”           Lyriq, a luxury full-electric SUV, is the epitome of GM’s future car technology, which plans on offering a range of more than 480 kilometers (300 miles) on a single charge and an advanced cruising system which, according to the carmaker, will be able to offer completely hands-free driver assistance features.           Cadillac, a fairly niche luxury brand in Korea, accounted for 0.7 percent of the newly registered vehicles last year in the import auto industry.            During the January to August period this year, it sold 886 new cars, a 26.5 percent year-on-year drop.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]   "
669,[Heroes from afar] Kiwi artillery proved critical during Korean War,"

     New Zealand Ambassador to Korea Philip Turner speaks with the Korea JoongAng Daily at the embassy in central Seoul on Aug. 13. [PARK SANG-MOON]               Ask any veteran about the worst parts of the Korean War, and you'll get the same answer, says Des Vinten, an 88-year-old New Zealand veteran.           ""The worst memory I have is not the war, but for dispatch riders, the extremes of weather,"" Vinten told the Korea JoongAng Daily on July 29. ""Ask any veteran and you will get the same answer. In the winter everything froze, in the ‘wet’ season, roads turned to deep soggy, sticky mud. Small streams and gutters became raging torrents capable of washing wheeled traffic away. I once saw four Americans drowned when their vehicle [another jeep] was overwhelmed by what had once been a culvert of shell cases under a road and had been washed away by a raging torrent of water and mud.""            Vinten was one of 6,000 New Zealanders who volunteered to serve in the Korean War (1950-1953).            “The government sought volunteers to form what was called the K-Force [also called Kayforce], the expeditionary force to go to Korea, and in around nine days, as many as 6,000 had enlisted,” said New Zealand Ambassador to Korea Philip Turner. “It was a big commitment because at the time, the population in the whole country was just 2 million.”               Six New Zealand navy frigates were also dispatched, the first two of which arrived at the end of July in 1950 and landed at Incheon.           The island country's armed forces weren't new to fighting in battles far from home.              “New Zealand is one of the founding members of the UN, and we believe our best security lies in collective defense with like-minded countries who share our values,” Turner said. “So for over 100 years we have contributed our troops to conflicts when we saw a threat to our values and interests.”               Starting with their contribution to South Africa’s Boer War in 1899, the Kiwis fought in both World Wars and subsequently were dispatched to Korea, Malaysia in the 1950s, Singapore through 1989, the Vietnam War and more recently to parts of the Middle East. Today, New Zealand maintains peacekeeping forces in about 12 nations, including in Korea.                 Many of these soldiers participated in more than one conflict; up to 30 percent of Kiwi soldiers in the Korean War had served in World War II, according to the New Zealand Embassy.               They included Vinten's two friends.           “Two of my friends who had previously served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan at the end of the Second World War, and who had seen the results of what happened when Japan occupied Korea, decided that they were not prepared to stand by and see something similar inflicted on Korea again by, at that time, another militarily superior force,” said Vinten. “From then on, it was simply a combination of youthfulness, adventure and a sense of fair play that led the three of us to offer our services in whatever way possible and, in our case, that meant enlisting.”              Des Vinten, New Zealand veteran of the Korean War (1950-1953), in this photo taken during his first posting to the Forward Maintenance Area in Seoul during the war. [DES VINTEN]               Vinten arrived in Busan in January 1952. He was soon assigned to the 1st British Commonwealth Division as a dispatch rider, and operated near the Imjin River.             At any hour of the day and night, no matter the weather conditions, he would be dispatched to deliver classified military orders and battle plans to units near the front lines.           “Line and radio messages could in many cases be intercepted by North Korea, so battle plans and similar communications were never sent by this means,” he said. “These matters were regular and irregular, could be day or night depending on what was going on. Weather and road conditions or the time of day were never a factor in when we were required. Getting dispatches through always took priority.”                Des Vinten sitting on the bonnet of his jeep. ""The 40 on the windscreen was the Tac Sign for 1 Britcom Divisional Signal Regiment, the Kiwi says I am a Kiwi dispatch rider and the vehicle number D11 tells every one I am a dispatch rider and should not be delayed when on the road,"" he said. [DES VINTEN]               The Kiwi soldiers’ artillery provided critical support to the Australian, British and Canadian forces. Such was the case during the Battle of Gapyeong in Gyeonggi in April 1951, when the Chinese and North Korean offensive reached its peak, trying to break through the United Nations forces to recapture Seoul. New Zealand also played a significant role during the Fourth Battle of the Hook, one of the last battles before the armistice was signed.           Artillery power was of particular importance during the war, according to Colonel Donald Jones, the current defense attaché of New Zealand to Korea, due to the country's mountainous terrain.           “From July 24 to 26, 1953, during the Fourth Battle of the Hook near the Imjin River, the New Zealand artillery was able to inflict some 2,000 to 3,000 casualties to the Chinese volunteer army,” Jones said.           Over the course of the war, the New Zealand forces fired some 800,000 shells, according to Jones.           But they still found moments to unwind periodically, often joined by their siblings across the ocean.           “It is said that whenever the New Zealand soldiers got together with the Australians, there were ‘volleys of hard words, mud, water, old eggs or anything throwable,’ according to T. J. Cottle, a New Zealand veteran,” said Ambassador Turner, quoting from historian Ian McGibbon’s book, “New Zealand and the Korean War” (1992).           “The other UN forces think we are crazy, but actually we are the only troops who have such a strong bond of comradeship, and that’s our way of showing it,” Cottle recalled, according to the book.             “From the time we served as Anzac — the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps — in World War I, we have a very close bond with Australia,” said Turner. “It’s a sibling rivalry, like between hyeong [the Korean word for older brother] and younger brother.”             Gunners from the 16th New Zealand Field Regiment pose for a photograph in front of Kiwi Hill at the regiment's headquarters in Korea in 1953. The photo has been provided by Sue Corkill, author of ""Korea: A Kiwi Gunner's Story,"" published by Fern Publishing in 2014. [SUE CORKILL]                New Zealand lost the lives of 33 men to the war. But the Korean War carries a rare legacy, in being able to demonstrate to the surviving soldiers that their service was not in vain.           Some five to six Kiwi veterans regularly participated in the Korean government’s revisit program to return annually before the Covid-19 outbreak, according to the embassy.             Vinten himself came back for the first time some 30 years after the war.             “My first [return] to Korea was with an official revisit program back in the 1980s, and I was reminded of my last words as I boarded a Pan Am Super G Constellation at Iwakuni for my trip home after 18 months of war in Korea,” Vinten said. “They were, ‘If I never see this place again, it will be too soon!’”           The country was drastically transformed, he said. The moment he stepped off the plane, Korean staff members looked like they “just stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine,” he recalled, the first in a series of shocks. On the ride from the airport to Seoul, he recalled seeing “thousands of lights, where once there were none.”           “I have been back to Korea four times, and each time the feeling and wonderment I have for Korea grows even stronger,” Vinten said, “and my pride in the very small part I played in what stands — where once war ruled — was assuredly worth the effort.""             Vinten wasn't alone among New Zealand veterans who said their memories of Korea made them want to return decades later.           “Hapi October, a veteran who had served in the war, and his son sent the embassy a picture of October taken near the 38th parallel line in 1952, asking if we would be able to locate the same place,” Turner said. “And sure enough, we were able to. So when they revisited in 2019, they were able to take a photo at the exact same location.”              Hapi October, Kiwi veteran of the Korean War (1950-1953), in a photo taken in Korea near the border in 1952, left, and at the same location in 2019 during his revisit. [HAPI OCTOBER]         October was so moved by Korea’s welcome during his visit that year that during his meeting with then-Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Pi Woo-jin in Seoul, he gifted her his Maori cloak, a traditional garment made from bird feathers and worn by indigenous New Zealanders.            Hapi October, New Zealand veteran of the Korean War, right, with then-Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Pi Woo-jin in Seoul in 2019. [EMBASSY OF NEW ZEALAND IN KOREA]               With many veterans now in their 80s or older, the association of Korean War veterans from New Zealand was disbanded in 2016. Vinten was the last president.           “[It was in] 1976 that the first National Kayforce reunion was held in Wellington and a formal organization of Veterans emerged as the New Zealand Korea Veterans Association [Nzkva],” Vinten said. “From that time up to 2016, the association met every year until […] it was finally decided to shut the Nzkva down because of the reduction of membership brought about by old age. Membership had dropped from 650 in the 1970s to approximately 64.”           They may no longer meet as regularly, but they remain interested in the affairs of Korea nonetheless, especially regarding inter-Korean relations.           “I remember during my first visit, the opinion most often stated in South Korea was overwhelmingly for one Korea [unification],” Vinten said. “Then some years later the opinion was turning toward 50/50, one side opting for a moderate form of unification and the other side favoring two Koreas. The last time I spoke to a Korean in diplomatic circles I was told that unification was off the table since most of the people he spoke to now were convinced that South Korea is, and will always be, better off economically as ‘South Korea.’”           He added, “The correct answer […] can only be given by those that are there.”           Despite the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent cancellation of most international events, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern honored several veterans on the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the war at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington on July 1.                New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, right, and Defence Minister Ron Mark at the ceremony to mark 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War (1950-1953) at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington on July 1. [NEW ZEALAND DEFENCE FORCE]          Vinten, who was present at the ceremony, said his memories of the war are not as painful, as he believes their efforts made a difference for the better.           “General McArthur said, in his final address to the United States Senate, ‘Old soldiers never die, they simply fade away,’” Vinten said. “We know the feeling but take comfort from the fact that the memory of what we did in Korea will live on into the future.”                New Zealand     From the outbreak of the Korean War (1950-1953) to 1957, New Zealand deployed to Korea 4,700 soldiers and 1,300 sailors on its six navy frigates. The first two frigates arrived on July 3, 1950. A total of 45 Kiwis died during this period — 33 during the war. The Kiwi soldiers operated with the British Commonwealth forces, often providing artillery support in key battles, including the Battle of Gapyeong in Gyeonggi in April 1951, the battles in the Mount Gowang area in Gyeonggi in October 1951 and the Third Battle of the Hook in today’s North Korea near the Panmunjom area in May 1953.

670,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Letting the robots take over is the secret to social distancing,"

                           Baedal Minjok’s Dilly Drive robots are tested in Gwanggyo Alleyway shopping complex in Suwon, Gyeonggi. [WOOWA BROTHERS]                                The coronavirus pandemic and the sudden need to separate ourselves from each other has changed how we live, work, communicate, spend our free time and even how we eat and drink. But what if rather than social distancing, we could remove the human element altogether?            At the headquarters of Woowa Brothers, operator of food delivery service Baedal Minjok, on Aug. 7, a robot was making its way around the building, delivering coffees from the cafe to employees.          The 1.08-meter (3.54-foot) tall robot with a face like an excited emoji was carrying drinks on shelves inside its body.            Communicating with the elevator wirelessly through the LTE network, Dilly Tower is able to drive himself around the building without any human help, including navigating different floors. This sets him apart from serving robots, which can make their way around a restaurant or cafe, but aren't ready to head out into the big, wide world just yet.           “I’m getting off at this floor,” Dilly Tower announces so that everybody knows to get out of his way — Dilly Tower can reach speeds of up to 1.2 meters per second.           Arriving at the desk of one of his customers, Dilly Tower needs a numerical code provided when the order was placed to unlock the shelf compartment and remove a drink.          Dilly Tower, currently being trialed, still seems to have some errors. At one point he thought he was in the elevator when he was actually standing next to it, and another time he thought the elevator was too full for him to enter when the doors hadn't even opened yet.           Yet despite the hiccups, the robot clearly fills a major gap in the food and beverage market — full service without the need for human contact. As the demand for contactless services has risen due to Covid-19, Woowa Brothers has pulled the planned commercialization date of Dilly Tower forward from next year to later this year.              Food delivery platform Baedal Minjok’s Dilly Tower robot operates in H Avenue Hotel in Gwangjin District, eastern Seoul. [WOOWA BROTHERS]               “The biggest change since Covid-19 is that the robot market has opened up faster than we expected,” said Joseph Kim, head of robot business development at Woowa Brothers. “Our belief in the robot business has grown stronger following the virus outbreak.”           For many years, Woowa Brothers has been working on robots to facilitate delivery. As the need has suddenly shot up following the pandemic, the company is accelerating its research.             In the future planned by Woowa Brothers, robots will be able to pick up an order from a restaurant, drive themselves to the delivery destination while following traffic rules and avoiding obstacles and safely deliver the food.             Woowa Brothers believes commercializing such robots could take some time due to current traffic regulations that bar robots from being operated in public facilities, like roads and parks. These robots are currently tested on private land, including at Konkuk University in eastern Seoul.             While there may be a longer wait for robots that are allowed to hit the road, Woowa Brothers is focusing on commercializing Dilly Tower and increasing the use of Dilly Plate, a serving robot that hit the market in November last year.            “Our goal was to rent out 100 Dilly Plates this year,” said Kim. “But as demand for contactless service has risen, we believe the number could reach 300 within the year.”           As of June, Woowa Brothers has rented out 85 Dilly Plates to 68 restaurants.           “Customers seem to feel safer at our restaurants following the virus because they don’t have to make contact with anyone once they enter,” said Kwon Hyang-jin, the owner of Italian restaurant Merry Go Kitchen in Jamsil, southern Seoul.             At Merry Go Kitchen, customers place their order through the Baedal Minjok, or Baemin, app. Forks and knives are delivered by a robot that pulls up next to the table, and then Dilly Plate turns up with the food.           “The drawback of a serving robot is that restaurants need to secure more space for the robot to pass by, which means there are fewer tables. But at times like this [when social distancing has become important], such space is very helpful.”           It’s been a year since the restaurant started using the robots. A restaurant its size usually needs two to three employees, according to the restaurant owner, but she gets by with just one part-timer, helping her save costs and the stress of managing a workforce.           “Robots can’t offer high-quality service. But considering that the average workload you get out of a person tends to only be about 70 percent, robots don't do any worse,” Kwon added.           GS Retail, which operates convenience store GS25, also has big robot plans.           It signed a memorandum of understanding with LG Electronics in July to use robots to deliver products inside buildings where a GS25 convenience store is located — a model similar to Dilly Tower. Tests will be conducted at a GS25 store in Parnas Tower in Gangnam, southern Seoul, in October.           Cafes and restaurants are also jumping on the bandwagon.           Restaurant operator CJ Foodville has started using a robotic hand that cooks vegetables and noodles at four of its VIPS buffet restaurants in recent months. It can cook Vietnamese noodles in just a minute.             At Robert Chicken franchise stores, chicken is fried by robots, while coffee franchise Dal.komm Coffee offers b;eat, an unmanned take-out coffee stand. B;eat, which uses a robotic arm to move plastic cups around to pour ice and coffee, is found in retail stores and office buildings.             Kim from Woowa Brothers believes an actual cooking robot will go far beyond just the robotic arms used these days.           “Those robots currently used at restaurants and cafes are industrial robots, meaning they have not been designed specifically for cooking.” He added, ”For a robot to actually cook, it needs to be aware of details, like controlling strength when slicing vegetables and knowing how a sauce should be used for a dish. It should also know when a food is properly cooked.”           Woowa Brothers is currently developing such a robot with a research team affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles. It thinks it will be three to four years before the robot is ready.             The development of actual cooking robots, along with the prevalent use of robots in general, could help people open restaurants without employing any humans, according to Kim.           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]         "
671,Kim Kwang-hyun added to injury list with kidney ailment,"

                  St. Louis Cardinals' Korean starter Kim Kwang-hyun has been placed on the injured list (IL) with a kidney ailment, bringing his promising rookie season to an abrupt halt.           The Cardinals announced Saturday that they've put Kim on the IL, retroactive to Wednesday. According to the Cardinals, Kim experienced abdominal pain on Friday morning and was taken to the emergency room at a Chicago hospital, where he was diagnosed with renal infarction.           Kim last pitched on Tuesday against the Cincinnati Reds and earned his second win of the season thanks to five shutout innings.           Kim had been scheduled to start against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago at 6:08 p.m. Sunday. It will be the fourth game of a five-game set between the National League Central rivals that began Friday.           Cardinals' President John Mozeliak told reporters that Kim, who's been placed on blood thinners, is feeling much better and that Kim will return to St. Louis on Sunday. He'll be allowed to participate in baseball activities at Busch Stadium once he's back in St. Louis, and Mozeliak said the Cardinals ""feel really good about what we've learned"" about Kim's condition.           ""The optimism for him to pitch or the expectation for him to pitch at some point this year is still a real possibility,"" Mozeliak said, as quoted by MLB.com. ""What you really don't want to have happen is obviously any bleeding or any bruising. What it has to do with is just sort of protecting himself. We want to see how the medication works with him for the next week or so, and then pending on how that goes, we'll then determine if we could actually use him in a game and how we would do that.”           The 32-year-old has thrived as a starter after beginning his rookie big league season as the team's closer. In five games, he has a 2-0 record and a save with a 0.83 ERA. He has a 0.44 ERA in his first four starts, the lowest by a rookie left-hander since Fernando Valenzuela in 1981. Kim hasn't given up an earned run in his last 17 innings.           An MVP-winning starter in 13 years in the KBO, Kim signed a two-year deal with the Cardinals last December and opened the season as the closer in July. After the Cardinals returned from a two-week hiatus forced by a Covid-19 outbreak within the team, Kim moved into the rotation and has been one of their most reliable starters since then.           The Cardinals' rotation is already missing former All-Star Carlos Martinez and Miles Mikolas. Mikolas had his season-ending surgery in late July, and Martinez could be back Tuesday.           Mozeliak said the Cardinals were aware of Kim's history of kidney issues before acquiring him, though the pain Kim experienced on Friday was unexpected. The team was initially concerned that Kim had suffered appendicitis.           ""This has some level of more severity for long term but is also something that's controllable and manageable that you don't have to have surgical intervention,"" Mozeliak said. ""So, to some level, there's some relief.”           Yonhap   "
672,FTC fines Naver for forcing partners not to work with Kakao,"

     Naver's office in Bundang, Gyeonggi. [NEWS1]               The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) announced Sunday that it will take punitive actions against Naver for preventing rival Kakao from entering the real estate information service business.            Naver contested the decision on the same day, claiming the information in question is its intellectual property and it has every right to protect it from its competitors.            The Fair Trade Commission imposed a fine of more than 1 billion won ($840,000) on Naver and ordered the company to correct the terms that prevented its partner real estate information providers from providing the same information to Kakao.           “Naver added an extra line in its contract with real estate content providers forbidding them from offering information to third parties. This was when Kakao started reaching out to those companies for content partnerships. By doing so, Naver has effectively ruled Kakao out of the market,” explained Kim Seung-geun of the FTC.           Between 2015 and 2017, Naver listed more than 40 percent of the properties for sale in Korea on its platform, which shows real estate listings and provides contact details for realtors. It also had more than 70 percent of unique visitors and page views, according to the FTC.           The information in question is the list of properties for sale introduced in 2009 and confirmed by Naver to provide accurate information to customers. Naver says the information is its own intellectual property considering the billions of won it invested and the creative effort it put in to distill the data.           Naver initially began cultivating real estate data on its own as content providers turned down offers for collaboration. It later outsourced reviewing of the information to the Korea Internet Self-governance Organization (KISO). It uploaded the filtered list of properties on the Naver Budongsan platform. It later made a deal with the information providers to receive fees for such services.           In February 2015, Kakao attempted to create a partnership with seven real estate content providers affiliated with Naver. The FTC says Naver added an extra line in its contracts that forbids its partners from providing information to a third party, including rival Kakao. A year later, it added another line that allowed Naver to terminate contracts with companies that violate this rule.           In 2017, Kakao again attempted to partner with one of Naver’s content providers. Naver notified the company it forbid it from providing any information to a third party for three months.           The FTC claims Naver’s predatory practices effectively pushed Kakao out of the market.           Naver claims all it was doing was protecting itself from “free riders” like Kakao who tried to take advantage of their intellectual property. It criticized the FTC for “ignoring its innovative efforts and fair right to exercise its rights” in an official statement Sunday.            BY KANG JAE-EUN   [kang.jaeeun@joongang.co.kr]   "

676,Activity in North suggests preparations for SLBM launch: CSIS,"

                  Satellite imagery showed activity at North Korea's main submarine shipyard in a possible sign that the communist nation could be preparing to test-fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), a U.S. think tank reported.           The primary indicator suggesting preparations for an SLBM launch is the presence of vessels at the North's Sinpo shipyard on the east coast, including one that resembles vessels previously used to tow the test stand barge out to sea, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).           Another indicator may be the presence of two Romeo-class submarines anchored within the bay of the submarine base on Mayang Island off the coast of Sinpo, the CSIS said in a report on its Beyond Parallel website, citing satellite imagery of the shipyard taken on Friday.           ""These apparent launch preparations might indicate the highly speculated 'October surprise,' which would be consistent with Beyond Parallel historical data that shows heightened provocations around U.S. presidential election years,"" the report said.           An SLBM test has been considered one of the provocative acts that the North could undertake, along with an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Some experts have warned that Pyongyang could carry out such provocations as an ""October surprise"" ahead of November's U.S. presidential election.           Nuclear negotiations between the North and the United States have been stalled since the second summit in Hanoi between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without an agreement in February last year.           Yonhap   "
677,"Government, ruling party agree on fourth supplementary budget","






     Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun, left, and ruling party leader Lee Nak-yon speak during a meeting held Sunday. [YONHAP]               The government and ruling party agreed Sunday to create a fourth supplementary budget worth 7 trillion won ($5.9 billion) to combat the additional economic fallout from the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic.          The government, Blue House and ruling Democratic Party (DP) agreed Sunday in a trilateral meeting to formulate a fourth supplementary budget worth between 7 trillion won and 8 trillion won, which will be 100 percent financed through the issuance of state bonds, according to DP spokesman Choi In-ho.           The budget will include the provision of another emergency fund, but this time it will be provided only to those considered to be hit hardest by the virus.           “The government will steadfastly discuss with related departments to announce comprehensive measures and submit the budget plan to the National assembly in the coming week,” said Choi on Sunday.           “The party will actively support the plan as well so that the budget can pass the National Assembly before Chuseok [which falls on Oct. 1].”           The DP holds a majority in the National Assembly and was able to pass the third supplementary budget without the participation of the main opposition party.           Those eligible for the latest emergency fund include certain types of contract workers, freelancers, unemployed or self-employed people and people with low-income. Choi said that it will include 12 types of businesses categorized as high-risk last month, including night clubs, karaoke bars and PC rooms that were ordered to cease operations as Covid-19 cases continued to increase.           The first emergency fund issued in May was available to everybody, with up to 1 million won issued per household.           “[The second emergency fund] will be formed to help those hit hard without forming any blind spots,” Prime Minister Chung-Se-kyun said.           This is the first time in 59 years that the government has applied for four supplementary budgets in a year, since 1961. Even when the economy was hit hard by the Asian financial crisis in 1997, only two rounds of extra budgets were announced afterwards each in 1998 and 1999.           “There is a distinguishing factor to the latest extra budget which is that the entire amount has to be financed through the issuance of national bonds,” said Lee Nak-yon, leader of the ruling party.           “Since it means that the budget is formed through debt, pressure has now grown that it should be used extremely effectively and wisely.”           The three supplementary budgets already issued have already increased Korea's national debt to 839.4 trillion won. Its ratio to GDP reached 43.5 percent as a result.           The fourth round is expected to expand the debt to near 850 trillion won by the end of this year, leading to a national debt-to-GDP ratio at 44.1 percent.           BY JIN EUN-SOO   [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]  "

[YONHAP]               North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visited typhoon-hit areas in the country's eastern South Hamgyong Province and presided over a Workers' Party meeting at the scene to discuss recovery efforts, state media reported Sunday.           The enlarged executive policy meeting was held on Saturday to gauge the damage from last week's Typhoon Maysak, which hit its eastern areas hard. More than 1,000 houses were destroyed, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).           The meeting ""had an in-depth discussion about the issue of the recovery from damage in the typhoon-hit areas of the two provinces and studied and decided on the detailed measures such as organization of building force to be urgently dispatched to the areas, designs and material transport,"" KCNA said.           Kim also called for party members, especially those in the capital, to ""take the lead in aiding the provinces when the country undergoes difficulties and hardships would make a great contribution to the strengthening of the single-minded unity of our society,"" the KCNA said.           ""Learning about the growth of the crops damaged by typhoon, he called for taking positive agricultural and technological measures for minimizing the reduction of the yield,"" it added.           During the meeting, the chairman of the ruling party's South Hamgyong provincial committee was dismissed over an apparent failure in coping with the typhoon, and a replacement was appointed, the KCNA said.           The exact location of the meeting was not disclosed by state media, but news clips from the Korean Central Television Broadcasting Station suggest the meeting took place in one of Kim's trains, given the window and seating arrangements.           Top officials attended the meeting, including Ri Pyong-chol, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers Party, and Pak Pong-ju, vice chairman of the State Affairs Commission.           In an open letter sent to party members in Pyongyang, Kim said that about 12,000 elite party members of the capital city will be sent to the two provinces each to help with recovery efforts, according to the KCNA.           Kim's visit to the typhoon-hit areas is seen as aimed at highlighting his image as a leader caring for the lives of his people as they have been reeling from back-to-back natural disasters.           Typhoon Maysak, the ninth tropical storm of the season, hit North Korea as the country was still reeling from damage caused by another typhoon and heavy downpours, which affected its major rice-producing areas in the southwestern province.           On Saturday, the North's main newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that the party decided to punish officials in the east coast city of Wonsan and Kangwon Province for failing to evacuate homes and take other preventive measures in advance of the typhoon, leading to the deaths of dozens of people.           Faced with global sanctions and the fallout from its protracted antivirus efforts, North Korea is concerned that recent back-to-back natural disasters affecting the farming sector could aggravate its chronic food shortage.           Kim and high-ranking officials recently increased their field trips to affected areas, urging efforts to speed up recovery and minimize a reduction in harvest.           Recently, Kim visited a typhoon-hit area last week and urged ""an all-out campaign"" of completing the recovery so that the country can mark the party's founding anniversary next month.           Yonhap   "

     Chinese pianist Lang Lang performs during a ceremony marking the release of his new album of studio recordings and live performances of Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations in Beijing on Sept. 4. [AFP/YONHAP]               In times of crisis star Chinese pianist Lang Lang believes music is the best medicine, especially Bach, who he says penned the perfect soundtrack for these pandemic-troubled times more than 250 years ago.           The globe-trotting performer, born in northeastern Shenyang in 1982, became famous playing the great romantic composers and has been ""keeping his hands warm"" returning to them in recent months.           But mastery of Bach has been the quest of a lifetime, he says.           ""Music is a good remedy in these particular times,"" he told AFP ahead of the release of his version of the Goldberg Variations on Friday.           ""Bach, if we compare him to other great composers, has an even greater healing power.""           To tackle the ""Variations"" — one of the most difficult pieces in Bach's repertoire due to its great variety of styles — Lang Lang drew deep into his past.           The pianist played the 30 Variations ""at the age of 10"" and knew them entirely by heart seven years later.           ""Memorising them wasn't that hard, because I started early.""           But ""to be ready […] 27 years. That's the truth,"" he said.           ""I have been waiting to really get to know the piece better.""           With the live entertainment world thrown into disarray by the virus, Lang Lang — a prolific performer who used to give at least 90 concerts a year before the pandemic — says he has missed playing in front of audiences.           ""What I missed the most is the stage,"" said Lang Lang, adding that he hoped a medical breakthrough could help end the disruption.           ""I wait for the vaccine, I get a shot and I go on a trip.""           He has not been entirely absent from his audiences. In April he accompanied Celine Dion, Lady Gaga, Andrea Bocelli and John Legend in a virtual concert celebrating health workers.           And despite his renown on the piano, he said he would not force his children into learning — unlike thousands of Chinese parents whose children learn from a young age.           ""If he or she wants to be a pianist, then they have to work, and I don't know if I'll be pushing or not,"" he said. ""Certainly I don't want to have a very tough time with my kids.""           But, he acknowledged, ""you have to work hard, there is no way to escape"".           The album, distributed by Deutsche Grammophon, contains a studio version and a concert version, recorded in March at St. Thomas Church in Leipzig, where Johann Sebastian Bach is buried.           AFP   "
681,[TEST DRIVE] Porsche's Taycan has all the power with a growl or two thrown in,"

                           Porsche's Taycan is driven at the 2020 Porsche World Roadshow on Sept. 2 at the AMG Speedway in Yongin, Gyeonggi. [PORSCHE KOREA]                YONGIN, Gyeonggi — Engines growled, while the smell of burnt rubber rose from the AMG Speedway on Wednesday as Porsche’s Taycan, the company’s first-ever pure electric vehicle (EV), was rolled out for the Korean press.           Korea was the Stuttgart-based high-end automaker’s first stop this year on its 2020 Porsche World Roadshow, as its previous stops were cancelled due to the coronavirus. Next will be Taiwan.           Porsche brought all its 26 models, even some not available in Korea, including the 718 Boxster T and 911 GT3 RS for a close look-up and test drives.           The Taycan, the brand’s first full-electric model, was in the lineup, with its Turbo and the Turbo S.           The entry-level Taycan 4S will be brought to Korea in December at the earliest, a slight delay from the initially planned November. The Turbo and Turbo S will available here next year.           Before taking the EV to the circuit, there was an opportunity to test how long it takes Taycan Turbo to reach 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) from zero. It is rated to hit that speed in 3.2 seconds, but the untrained had trouble breaking five seconds.           With a full press of the accelerator, the amateur can easily get the vehicle to 150 kilometers an hour in no time, head driven back by the g-force and stomach flutter.           No wonder, the instructor, who sat next to the me during the test, warned not to close my eyes and asked if I had blood pressure issues, which I thought at the time was an odd set of warnings.           A test drive of the Taycan Turbo S followed, which allowed me to do two laps of the circuit. As the models are not approved yet in Korea, they cannot be driven on public roads.           At first glance, the car resembles the four-door Panamera sedan. Up close, I got more of a 911 vibe, with the headlamps situated a bit higher on the hood.           The seats were positioned low to give the driver the feeling of a two-door sports car. That was noticeable, as most EVs have high front seats to accommodate the batteries. The curved instrument cluster behind the steering wheel wowed with its combination of minimalism and sophistication.                The interior of the Taycan. [PORSCHE KOREA]               The power button is to the left of the steering wheel, a Porsche signature, and the gear lever is placed just to the right of the steering wheel instead of in the center area.           This design leaves the center console completely button-free.           With lineage which traces back to the 911, performance is in the DNA. It was powerful yet stable on the track. Having driven internal combustion Porsche sport cars in earlier session, I can say that nothing was lost in terms of handling as the company went fully electric.           Under European standards, the Turbo S has a maximum horsepower of 460 and torque of 850. It takes 2.8 seconds to reach 100 kilometers per hour.           It can go 412 kilometers (256 miles) on a single charge, while the Turbo version can be driven up to 450 kilometers.           To cater to those who admire Porsche for its sports car heritage, the brand added an artificial engine sound. When turned on, the car emits a growl that’s been engineered in. It seem a bit off to me, like something from a spaceship in a sci-fi movie.           The 4S costs 145.6 million won ($122,400) before subsidy. The Turbo is 195.5 million won, and the Turbo S is 233.6 million won.              Porsche lineup on the circuit during the Porsche World Roadshow at the AMG Speedway in Yongin, Gyeonggi.

682,"Doctors' groups, gov't reach agreement to end strike","

     Park Ji-hyun, interim leader of the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) leading the strike, speaks at a press conference last week criticizing the government's reform plans. Park and KIRA announced Sunday the group was acquiescing to an agreement between the government and the Korean Medical Association to suspend the strike amid the Covid-19 outbreak. [YONHAP]               After bitter infighting, Korea’s leading organization representing trainee doctors on Sunday reluctantly agreed to call off a weekslong strike against the government’s plan to increase medical school quotas.           To the last minute, hardliners within the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) were resisting an agreement reached between the Korean Medical Association (KMA) and the ruling Democratic Party Friday to end a coordinated walkout by trainee doctors carried out since Aug. 21.          Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, the KMA agreed to end the strike in exchange for the government backing off from its plans to increase the number of medical students and open a new medical school for public health doctors until the outbreak subsides.             The deal, however, immediately received intense backlash from many younger doctors and trainees who claimed KMA President Choi Dae-zip had no right to reach an agreement to end the strike on their behalf.             Within KIRA, members were split among those who supported the decision to return to work while carrying out individual protests against government plans and those who argued the strike should carry on indefinitely until the government fully retracts its plans.           After two days of internal debate, KIRA’s leadership Sunday afternoon announced it was supporting the agreement to suspend the strike, while protesting its exclusion from the talks between the government and KMA.           “With the KMA and government’s snap agreement, the justification for [the strike] has faded away,” said Park Ji-hyun, KIRA’s interim president, admitting the strike could not continue in its current form.           “We are not satisfied, but we have shown that young doctors have the ability to unite to discuss medical issues and solve them.”          With the strike effectively over for now, trainee doctors were likely to return to work by Monday morning, according to medical sources.            But fierce resistance from several elements within KIRA suggested many would not obey the organization’s leaders and continue the strike on their own. Some members even attempted a vote of no confidence against Park, which failed.                Korean Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo, right, and Korean Medical Association President Choi Dae-zip hold up a signed agreement. The two sides agreed to end the strikes in exchange for the government suspending its plans. [YONHAP]               The dispute even triggered a physical scuffle at a KIRA meeting on Saturday, when a trainee doctor in his 20s allegedly assaulted a medical professor who spoke at the meeting despite not being invited.             One particularly contentious issue was the national medical license exam, which had been boycotted by medical students. The government last week postponed the tests, set for September and October, by one week to encourage a compromise, but hardliners insist the boycott of the tests should continue even if the strike ends.             Since the strike began on Aug. 21, major hospitals nationwide have been operating at a reduced capacity, leading to overloading at emergency centers and surgery postponements.             Following the government-KMA agreement on Friday, five groups representing private and public hospitals nationwide issued a joint statement calling on trainee doctors and students to return to medical centers and schools.          Seoul National University Hospital also released the results of a poll it conducted over the weekend showing that 87.4 percent of its doctors and medical professors agreed with younger doctors favoring a return to work in accordance with the agreement with the government.          BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]   "
683,[Post-Covid-19 New Normal] Dark stores are all the rage as e-commerce takes over,"

     A remodeled Emart branch in Jung-gu, central Seoul, can process more online orders. [JEON TAE-GYU]               Retailers in Korea are facing a new challenge amid the rising demand for online shopping.          With the growing use of dark stores — spaces that look like supermarkets but only cater to orders for delivery or collection — the competition to deliver packages faster through last-mile delivery services has suddenly become one of the most important factors in attracting customers.             Last-mile delivery refers to the rapid movement of goods from a transportation hub to the final delivery destination. It is the key to the operation of dark stores.           Food delivery platform Baedal Minjok, or Baemin, launched its B Mart dark stores in November last year, using its delivery infrastructure and network. Its rival Yogiyo plans to roll out dark stores in the second half of this year.           Delivery company Barogo jumped into the retail market in June through a partnership with convenience store start-up Now Pick, which only accepts online orders.             Barogo rents out its unused space in Dogok-dong in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, to Now Pick.             Barogo’s 144-square-meter (1,550-square-foot) space is stocked with products sold by Now Pick, which includes handbags and cosmetics.           Barogo handles deliveries from the hub, as well as from five other Now Pick stores across Seoul. Delivery from Now Pick is said to be possible within 30 minutes.           Instead of rent, Now Pick pays Barogo a certain percentage of the profit incurred from sales at the hub.           “As the demand for last-mile delivery grows stronger, more players are trying to be part of the service,” said Kim Ga-hyun, a spokesperson for Barogo. “Barogo has 800 hubs in populated areas, and we’re indeed willing to rent out more of that space [to be used as dark stores].”           With the online shopping boom, companies are lining up to enter the e-commerce space, either from a customer-facing perspective or, like Barogo, on the logistics side. According to Statistics Korea, online shopping in July was worth 12.96 trillion won ($10.89 billion), up 15.8 percent on year. It was the highest monthly figure since Statistics Korea started collecting data in 2001.           “The new [dark store] business could be a good opportunity for Yogiyo to evolve into a retail platform beyond just a food delivery platform amid the changing market that focuses on non-face-to-face services,” said Kim So-jung, head of the new business division at Delivery Hero Korea, the Korean unit of the Berlin-based food delivery company that operates Yogiyo.             Delivery Hero Korea believes Yogiyo Express, an artificial intelligence-based delivery dispatching system, will help the company operate dark stores efficiently.           Amid the continuous entrance of new players, traditional discount marts are trying to stay afloat by transforming their existing physical stores to handle online orders.             Starting in April, Lotte Mart installed dark stores and smart stores at two of its branches in Nowon District in northern Seoul and Gwanggyo in Suwon, Gyeonggi.           Its dark store adapts a closed section of the store into an automated packing facility, similar to a purpose-built dark store. Its smart store is a hybrid concept, where everything from picking and packing is visible in the store in the same aisles where people shop.             In these branches, pickers — employees who shop for online customers — collect items from the shelves in the public area and then carry them into a packing facility.             Lotte Mart said it plans to expand the number of dark stores to 29 by 2021, while also opening 12 more smart stores by 2021.           Emart opened a similar store in its branch in Jung-gu, central Seoul, in January.             The branch, jointly operated by Emart and its e-commerce operator SSG.com, is a smaller version of SSG.com’s NEO distribution centers in Gimpo and Yonggin, Gyeonggi.             An entire floor of the Emart store has been redesigned to facilitate picking and packing with conveyor belts and wider aisles for pickers to move around more easily, although the remodeled space may have made the shopping experience less optimal for offline customers, since there are employees constantly moving with around boxes of products.           Regardless, the result has been quite successful. Since the remodeling, the number of packages the branch can handle has increased fivefold from 1,000 per day to 5,000. The number of orders has also shot up more than fourfold, from 950 per day to 4,500.           “Including Emart, offline stores are transforming into spaces that can handle more online orders,” said Kim Ha-eun, a spokesperson for SSG.com. “Our primary focus at the moment is building a distribution center, but we’re keeping an eye on how the [remodeled] branch performs throughout the year, and we’re open to the idea of remodeling other stores.”           Homeplus plans to add facilities to all of its offline stores by 2021, from three currently, to improve last-mile delivery. The discount chain will increase its number of pickers from 1,400 to 4,000.           “Before Covid-19, customers only used last-mile services when they needed something urgently,” said a spokesperson for BGF Retail, which also offers last-mile delivery through its CU convenience stores. “Now, people actually shop through last-mile services.”           In August last year, snacks and beverages were the two most popular product categories ordered online at CU. This year during the same month, beverages topped the chart, followed by home meal replacement kits. Food ingredients were also in the top five.           “We’ve entered the last-mile delivery war,” said Prof. Seon Yong-gu, who teaches business at Sookmyung Women’s University. “In the past, having a big space and facilities like a parking lot were important factors for retailers. In the IT era, having a verified fast delivery service has become the key to success.”             An important factor to win that war includes saving delivery costs. For retailers, last-mile is seen as the most inefficient delivery service, accounting for 53 percent of logistics costs, according to analyst Kim Jae-hoon from Mirae Asset Daewoo.           Unmanned robot delivery is rising as a solution to reducing cost for last-mile delivery, according to analyst Park Moo-hyun from Hana Financial Investment.            “Each unmanned delivery robot could replace at least five peoples' work,"" said Park. ""Once they’re fully tested, companies are expected to adopt them quickly. In Korea, robot delivery is still in its early stage, but elsewhere like the United States, it’s all happening. Amazon Prime, for instance, recently got clearance for drone delivery.”           BY JIN MIN-JI   [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]   "
684,"For many, it's a choice between quitting and not working","

     Eastar Jet’s labor union and others Thursday in front of the National Assembly in Yeouido, western Seoul, protesting the release of a restructuring list slated for next Tuesday. The company is under pressure to lay off around 600 people. [YONHAP]                A woman in her 40s who works for Lotte Tour has been given an unenviable set of options. She can take unpaid leave, or she can resign. The company says it can no longer offer paid leave.             If she resigns, the woman can receive unemployment allowances and severance pay, but she is afraid that she will not be able to get a job again because the tourism industry has been hit hard by the pandemic. Even if she chooses the six-month unpaid leave, she thinks that she will ultimately have to resign after a period of time.           “If I choose to go on an unpaid leave, then I will have trouble paying for my child's cram schools, but I am also afraid that I will never be able to find a job again,” she said.           As the pandemic drags on, companies have to make some tough decisions. Many are choosing to reorganize their operations — in some cases, closing down the businesses entirely.           Hanwha is offering voluntary retirement to all employees in its trade department. As of the end of the second quarter, the department had 265 full-time workers including last year's new hires. The trade arm recorded operating losses of 3.2 billion won ($2.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2019. It also suffered a 18.8 billion won operating loss in the first quarter of 2020 and a 6.3 billion won operating loss in the second quarter. Six foreign offices that did not perform well have been shuttered.             “The trade arm had already been suffering, and the coronavirus pandemic added to the unfavorable conditions,” said a Hanwha spokesperson.             Eastar Jet is in search of a new owner after its takeover by Jeju Air was canceled in July, and the company needs to cut head count by about half to sell the business. Companies that have expressed interest in direct or indirect investments into Eastar Jet have demanded a slimmer organization as a precondition, but only 91 people have applied for voluntary resignations. Eastar Jet is planning on releasing a list of layoffs as early as next Tuesday.           Hotel Lotte has implemented an initiative called the “senior wage system,” which is essentially an early retirement plan. The company states that it is allowing its employees to choose between working at 50 percent wage or early retirement for those 58 and above.             Hotel Lotte has a bumpy road ahead. Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin has mentioned the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) of the company several times, but first-half sales dropped 48.2 percent on year. The company also flipped from an operating profit of 97.3 billion won during last year’s first half to an operating loss of 342 billion won in the first half of 2020.             Tension has been building between labor and management.           The South Gyeongsang branch of the National Labor Relations Commission at the end of July took the side of 207 workers at Doosan Heavy Industries who requested aid for an alleged unfair furlough. Doosan Heavy Industries in May notified 111 office workers and 357 production laborers of furlough until the end of December.           In the grand scheme of downsizing, the known restructuring plans of businesses of voluntary resignations and unpaid leaves are only a tip of the iceberg — some companies have selected discreet ways to restructure their businesses. An unnamed airline that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic is currently merging and abolishing businesses abroad. The employees at foreign branches are vying for opportunities at the company’s other international offices.             Posco has declared that the company will not push for restructuring. The steelmaker has finalized a wage compromise based on the promise with the labor union that there will be no forced restructuring. The union accepted frozen wages and stable employment.             E-land Retail, operator of New Core outlets and Donga Department stores, has promised not to pressure employees in exchange for voluntary unpaid leave.             “The situation of a dramatic cutdown in manufacturing jobs combined with a dim prospect for employment in the second half is close to a catastrophe,” said Lee Young-min, a human resources professor at Sookmyung Women’s University. “In the long term, there needs to be more investment into training in preparation for the future employment market. These will be more effective than the government’s employment scheme.”             BY LEE SOO-KI, KANG KI-HEON   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]               "
685,Wiz pitcher So Hyeong-jun is walking in Ryu Hyun-jin's footsteps,"

     KT Wiz starter So Hyeong-jun throws a pitch during a game against the Doosan Bears at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in southern Seoul on May 8. [NEWS1]                Having overcome a freshman slump, KT Wiz pitcher So Hyeong-jun is getting right back into the KBO’s Rookie of the Year race.           As a high school rookie, So started off his KBO career with a 7.06 ERA for the month of May. His performance in August tells a very different story.            Throughout five starts in August, So picked up four wins and had a 1.57 ERA, good enough to be ranked first in the league’s monthly ranking. Of his four wins, he’s had quality starts in three games and a 0.198 batting average.            Having made his debut with the Wiz on May 8, during a game against the Doosan Bears at Jamsil Baseball Stadium in southern Seoul, So didn’t waste any time picking up a win. By doing so, he became only the eighth high school rookie to pick up a win in their first KBO start.            Following that first win, So continued his streak by picking up his second win in his next start, against the Samsung Lions at Suwon Baseball Stadium on May 15. Starting off the rookie season with two straight wins, So quickly arose as a strong candidate to win the Rookie of the Year award.            Despite that early success, So started to struggle. Throughout June, So managed just one win with four losses. Following his start against the Hanwha Eagles on June 26, So was given a two-week break.            He didn’t waste those two weeks. During that time, So learnt a new pitch — a cut fastball — from the Wiz’s two foreign pitchers and pitching coach Park Seung-min. So returned looking much stronger, and has now helped the Wiz into a potential postseason spot for the first time in the club's history.          As of Sunday, So has picked up nine wins and five looses throughout 17 starts, with a 4.42 ERA. He is only one win away from picking up his 10th win in his rookie season.            The Wiz are also looking stronger this season as they are tied for fourth, along with the Bears, with 55 wins, 43 losses and one draw.            Below are edited excerpts of an interview with So.            Q. You showed an amazing performance in August. What drove you to success last month?          A. I always get a lot of help from our coaches and veteran teammates. Trying to keep the mindset of focusing only on the things that I can do on the mound helps me to see good results.               Q. Were you struggling to focus on the mound?          At the beginning of the season, I would be shaken by the [umpire calling] walks or errors. I tried not to show it, but it always led to get bad results. But now, I’ve accepted that those are the areas that I can’t control. Honestly, in terms of fielder errors, I think it’s partly my fault for not being able to finish the inning early, which leads them to lose concentration. If there are variables, then I focus on trying to give up the least number of runs.                Q. You seemed to be stronger when you were pitching against teams with strong batting lineups like the Bears or NC Dinos. Do you do anything differently?           I’m sure the opposing batters analyze me, and I always prepare for each game. Our veteran catcher Jang Sung-woo’s lead has been a great help. I don’t really think about my performance against specific teams.                Q. Despite being a rookie, your poker face on the mound has left an impression. How do you do that?          A. Until I was in high school, I struggled to hide my emotions on the mound. But our pitcher Bae Je-seong gave me some advice. Through it, I was able to understand why pitchers shouldn’t show their emotions on the mound. I try hard to keep that.               Q. Before the start of the season, you also mentioned that Kang Baek-ho gave you advice too. What was it?           A. He told me not to get overawed by the name value and just throw my pitches. I didn’t get this when I was pitching well, but as I struggled in a number of games, I started to get scared [that I might give away a hit or a home run]. I realized that to see good results, I have to pitch with confidence.                Q. If you have to pick a batter that you feel is the most tricky to pitch against, who would that be?           A. It would be Oh Jae-il of the Bears. None of the pitches that are thrown outside of the strike zone work. He doesn’t react to any of the pitches that aren’t thrown within his strike zone.                Q. Then what was the most exciting matchup for you?           A. It was against the Samsung Lions’ Kim Ji-chan, who graduated in the same class as I did. We’ve known each other since elementary school. Back in middle school, I gave up a lot [of hits to him]. In the professional league, we faced each other four times, and I only gave up one hit. Whenever I see Ji-chan [at-bat] I smile. It’s fun to pitch against him.               Q. Your manager Lee Kang-chul said your outstanding performance was thanks to the addition of your cutter. What do you think?          A. Every time I throw it, it still feels different. It’s only been about a month since I started throwing that pitch. If I had the hang of it already I would be a genius. I'm still trying to get a feel for it. It’s not at a satisfactory level yet.               Q. Your ground ball per fly ball ration is at 1.83, good enough to be ranked first within the team. How do you feel?          A. Since high school, I wasn’t a power pitcher who strikes out a lot of batters. To get an out count with a strikeout, I need at least three pitches. There definitely are situations where I need the ability to strike out a batter. I think I need to learn that through experience. But I think it’s more important to throw a pitch that leads the batter to hit a grounder from my first pitch.                Q. For the first time since Ryu Hyun-jin back in 2006, you are en route to pick up 10 wins as a high school rookie. How do you feel about that?          A. Just my name being mentioned along with Ryu is an honor. I think it’s quite a record for a high school rookie to pick up 10 wins. But I’m trying not to think about it. I don’t have time to think about adding a win when I’m on the mound. As I focus on one batter at a time, I believe the meaningful numbers will follow.               Q. You’re also being mentioned as one of the most likely candidates for the KBO’s Rookie of the Year award this year. Are you thinking about that at all?          A. Our pitching coach Park Seung-min told me that when I try to grab it, it’ll get farther away. And that if I continue pitching well like now then the results will come along. I agree with him. Manager Lee Kang-chul gave me similar advice.               Q. The Wiz are competing for a postseason spot, raising the expectations for the rest of the season. How do you feel?          A. I’ve had big ups and downs with my pitching up until now. That is the part that I’m the most disappointed in. I’ll try to keep up my great pace for as long as possible. I’ll get through the season until the end, without getting injured.            BY AN HEE-SOO   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

[JOONGANG ILBO]               Korea is running out of available I.C.U. beds at hospitals in the greater Seoul area, where the recent spike in Covid-19 cases has been centered, the government said Sunday.           There were just four I.C.U. beds available in hospitals in Seoul as of Saturday, according to the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters. There were none available in Gyeonggi and Incheon.           The Korean government is reviewing options for transporting severely ill Covid-19 patients from the greater Seoul area to other hospitals with I.C.U. wards in the country, if necessary. There are a total of 552 I.C.U. beds in Korea, of which 42, including the four in Seoul, were immediately available as of Saturday, according to the disaster and safety headquarters.             The ICU wards are usually equipped with ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices, often needed by severely ill Covid-19 patients.             Korea recorded 167 additional coronavirus cases on Saturday, 152 of which were domestic and 15 imported, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Of the new patients, four were diagnosed in critical condition and have been hospitalized in I.C.U. wards.           Of Korea’s total 21,177 cases as of Saturday, 163 were in critical condition, according to the KCDC.           Many of latest cases have been focused in the greater Seoul area. Of the 152 new domestic cases added on Saturday, 76 percent were in the greater Seoul area — 63 cases in Seoul, 45 in Gyeonggi and nine in Incheon.             The nation’s daily cases remained below 200 for the fourth day in a row. But the government announced Friday that it will be maintaining the heightened social distancing recommendations and adding new restrictions to high-risk businesses in the greater Seoul area.             The Ministry of Health and Welfare said Friday that the heightened social distancing recommendations, at a so-called ""Level 2.5,"" will be maintained in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi for another week through Sept. 13, while Level 2 measures for the entire nation will be extended for two more weeks to Sept. 20.           Starting Monday, bakery, ice cream and bingsu (shaved ice dessert) chains in the greater Seoul area can’t allow their customers to eat or drink inside the establishments at any time; only takeout orders and deliveries are allowed. The restrictions are the same as those already in effect for coffee chains.             Some 671 vocational training institutes in the Seoul metropolitan area have to shut down as well and offer online courses only.             Churches in the greater Seoul area will remain closed until Sept. 20, during which time they can only offer online services. Churches outside the greater Seoul area can offer offline services, but local government offices will have the authority to decide whether to strengthen restrictions for religious communities within their jurisdiction, the central government said.           Other restrictions in the Seoul metropolitan area will remain the same.           Restaurants and bars, along with independent coffee shops and bakeries, can offer normal services and allow customers to eat and drink inside the stores — until 9 p.m., after which they can only provide takeout until 5 a.m.           All indoor sports facilities, indoor golf practice ranges and billiard halls will remain shut, as will day care centers. Hagwon, or private cram schools, with 10 or more people can only hold online classes. Visits to nursing homes and other nursing facilities for the elderly are banned as well.           Most schools also saw their social distancing measures extended Friday.           In the greater Seoul area, all students in kindergarten through middle school will remain home and engage in online learning until Sept. 20. High schools will run up to a third of their total capacity.           Outside the Seoul metropolitan area, kindergartens, elementary schools and middle schools can run at up to a third of their total capacity, while high schools can run at a maximum of two-thirds.           Korea’s daily new Covid-19 cases were holding steady at around a dozen or less daily as of early August, but following clusters of outbreaks in schools, churches and cafes, new cases spiked to 279 by Aug. 15.             A massive protest involving thousands of people from all over the country in the Gwanghwamun Square on Aug. 15 only added to the uptick of cases.           The government responded by tightening social distancing restrictions to try to curb the outbreak. In its three-tiered system, the government raised the recommendation to Level 2 in the greater Seoul area from Aug. 16, to be effective for two weeks, and in the rest of the country from Aug. 23, also to be effective for two weeks.             As the daily additions of cases hit the 400s by the end of last month, the recommendations have been reinforced with additional directives from the government.             BY ESTHER CHUNG   [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]   "
687,Influencer culture skewered in Gia Coppola film,"

     U.S. director Gia Coppola arrives for the screening of the film ""Mainstream"" presented in the Orizzonti competition on the fourth day of the 77th Venice Film Festival on Sept. 5 at Venice Lido, during the Covid-19 infection, caused by the novel coronavirus. [AFP/YONHAP]               Coronavirus lockdowns have kept most U.S. filmmakers and actors away from the Venice Film Festival, but Gia Coppola and Maya Hawke have brought a bit of today's America to the Lido with ""Mainstream,"" a skewering look at YouTube and influencer culture.           The two descendants of Hollywood royalty (Coppola is a grandchild of Francis Ford and Hawke is the first-born of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke) said they have been tested repeatedly for the virus since arriving, as required by festival organizers for participants from outside Europe.           ""It feels like a moment where we're like 'O.K., we can follow the rules and we can still celebrate art and filmmaking and protect each other, keep each other safe,'"" Hawke said, adding that she appreciated in particular the discipline of festival-goers in adhering to Italy's antivirus precautions that include mask mandates and social distancing norms.           In the United States, ""we're still really struggling and having trouble working together. And that's what feels so good about being here — that everyone is working together really, really well and respecting each other,"" she told The Associated Press on Saturday.           It's Coppola's second feature-length film and second appearance at Venice, after her 2013 debut ""Palo Alto,"" competed in the Horizons section for up-and-coming talent, where ""Mainstream"" is also making its debut.           The film stars Hawke as Frankie, a Los Angeles bartender whose YouTube video of a charismatic nobody, played by Andrew Garfield, becomes an internet sensation. The film explores the underbelly of influencer culture and the constant need to get attention from strangers on social media.           ""It asks the question about whether or not it's possible to make art while you're still trying to get attention and look for likes,"" said Hawke, currently getting her own attention for her role on the Netflix series ""Stranger Things."" Hawke said her instinctive answer is no, but allows that Garfield's final performance in which his persona unravels online certainly counts as art.           Coppola said she was inspired to make the film by ""A Face in the Crowd,"" the 1957 film starring Andy Griffith about a drifter who becomes a radio and television sensation. ""Mainstream"" is essentially a redux and variation.           ""The morals for me are that all that glitters is not gold, and community and connection is really important,"" Coppola said.           The festival, the first major in-person cinema showcase after Covid-19 locked down the film industry, wraps up on Sept. 12. In addition to the Horizons competition, 18 films are competing for the Golden Lion in the main selection.           AP   "
688,Struggling to maintain Iraq's Jewish heritage,"

     Ranj Abderrahman Cohen, an Iraqi Kurdish Jewish man, stands at a ruined Jewish synagogue in Arbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, on July 5. [AFP/YONHAP]               Growing up in Iraq, Omar Farhadi would heat up dinner for his Jewish neighbors when they rested on the Sabbath. Few are left, and their heritage risks fading away too.           Across Iraq, Jewish roots run deep: Abraham was born in Ur in the southern plains, and the Babylonian Talmud, the central text of Judaism, was compiled in the town of the same name in the present-day Arab state. Jews once comprised 40 percent of Baghdad's population, according to a 1917 Ottoman census.           But after the creation of the Israeli state in 1948, regional tensions skyrocketed and anti-Semitic campaigns took hold, pushing most of Iraq's Jews to flee.           In the north, the Kurdish regional capital of Arbil was once the heart of the ancient kingdom of Adiabene, which converted to Judaism in the 1st century and helped fund the building of the Temple of Jerusalem.           Today, Iraqis have fond memories of Jewish friends and neighbors, including 82-year-old Farhadi, whose father owned a shop in a Jewish-majority district of Arbil.           Farhadi himself had several Jewish classmates at school and learnt English from a Jewish teacher, Benhaz Isra Salim.           ""One day in early 1950, Professor Benhaz came to say goodbye to our Arabic teacher. They hugged and began to cry because Benhaz was traveling to Israel,"" he recalled.           ""All of us students started to cry as well. That was the end of Jews in Arbil.""               Fading ties       The roughly 150,000 Jews still in Iraq in 1948 fled fast: By 1951, 96 percent were gone. Staying meant defying growing discrimination and property expropriation.           Following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, some Jews were flown to Israel on special evacuation flights while others left during the ensuing years of sectarian warfare.           By 2009, there were only eight Jews left in Baghdad, according to diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks.           The internecine violence did not grip the Kurdish region.           A 2015 law in the zone recognized Judaism as a protected religion and created an official representative, a post now held by 58-year-old Sherko Abdallah.           The law, and the lack of sectarian bloodshed in the zone, created an environment of ""more coexistence"" compared to federally-run areas in the south, he told AFP.           Still, of the estimated 400 families of Jewish descent in the Kurdish zone, some have converted to Islam in recent years.           ""Most others practice in secret, because admitting you're Jewish is still a sensitive issue in Iraq,"" said Abdallah, adding that his ""connections"" within the Muslim-majority community had helped keep him safe.           A real sense of identity, however, was still missing.           He applied for official permission to build a Jewish community center but had not received official approval.           ""I want a Jewish leader to come teach us the proper customs, but that's not possible under the current conditions,"" Abdallah added.           And the link between the few families left and the roughly 219,000 Jews of Iraqi origins in Israel — the largest contingent from Asian origins — is fraying.           ""Now, the Iraqi Jews who left to Israel in the 1950s still find ways back into the Kurdish region with their Iraqi ID cards,"" Abdallah told AFP.           ""But within five years, they will pass away and the whole relationship will be severed.""               History in ruins        There is already little to see.           Many Jewish homes were seized by the Iraqi state before 2003, and Jewish schools, shops and synagogues across the country are mostly crumbling from lack of maintenance.           In the north, heritage is faring slightly better. Arbil's Museum of Education, housed in the city's oldest primary school, includes a room dedicated to Daniel Kassab, a well-known Jewish Kurdish art teacher and painter.           Residents of Halabja, Zakho, Koysinjaq and other parts of Kurdistan still refer to old ""Jewish neighborhoods"" when giving directions in their hometowns.           In Al-Qosh, the Jewish prophet Nahum's tomb is being restored through a $1 million grant from the United States as well as funds from local authorities and private donations.           Baghdad and Washington are in talks to return the Iraqi Jewish Archives, over 2,700 books and tens of thousands of documents whisked away to the United States after the invasion.           Such initiatives could save Jewish heritage across the country, including the Baghdad home of Sassoon Eskell, Iraq's first finance minister under British mandate.           Eskell established Iraq's first financial system and indexed its currency to gold.           ""He was one of the columns in Iraq's history. You don't get two men like that,"" said Rifaat Abderrazzaq, an expert on Baghdad's Jewish heritage.           But today, Eskell's home on the banks of the Tigris River in the capital lies abandoned and partly ruined.           ""Almost none of the beautiful, widespread Jewish heritage of Baghdad is left,"" lamented Abderrazzaq.           ""There is hardly anything but memories.""           AFP   "
689,'World's loneliest elephant' cleared to leave zoo,"

     Amir Khalil, head of project development at FOUR PAWS International, sedates Kaavan, an elephant at the Marghazar Zoo in Islamabad, Pakistan, Sept 4, 2020. [REUTERS/YONHAP]               An elephant who has become a cause célèbre for animal rights activists around the world will be allowed to leave his Pakistani zoo and transferred to better conditions, the animal welfare group helping with the case said Saturday.           Dubbed the ""world's loneliest elephant"" by his supporters, Kaavan has languished at a zoo in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad for more than 35 years.           Martin Bauer, a spokesman for Four Paws, said the elephant has been finally given medical approval to travel, most likely to Cambodia, where he will find companionship and better conditions.           The overweight elephant Kaavan underwent a full medical examination at the zoo on Friday, said Bauer.           In May, Pakistan's High Court ordered the Marghazar Zoo closed because of its abysmal conditions blamed on systemic negligence.           Rescuing Kaavan from the zoo's dire conditions attracted the attention of animal activists around the world, and celebrities including U.S. singer Cher, who lobbied for his relocation.           “Unfortunately, the rescue comes too late for two lions that died during an attempted transfer at the end of July after local animal handlers set a fire in their enclosure to force them into their transport crates,"" Bauer said in a statement released on Saturday.           He said Four Paws was invited by the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board to safely transfer the remaining animals in the zoo. Kaavan has until now been forced to live a solitary life in a small enclosure.           Friday's medical examination showed the elephant was overweight, even as he showed signs of malnutrition. His nails were cracked and overgrown apparently from years of living in an improper enclosure with flooring that damaged his feet.           “Following the checks, which confirmed Kaavan is strong enough, steps will now be taken to finalize his relocation to an animal sanctuary potentially in Cambodia,"" Bauer said.           His recovery will be a long one, said Bauer, adding that Kaavan's wounds are more than just physical. He also suffers behavioral issues.           Kaavan, who lost his partner in 2012, has battled loneliness as well as poor living conditions. Both have taken their toll, said Bauer in an interview.           “He also developed stereotypical behavior, which means he shakes his head back and forth for hours. This is mainly because he is simply bored,"" said Bauer.           The Four Paws team that carried out Kaavan's physical included wildlife veterinarians and experts.           It wasn't immediately known when Kaavan would be able to travel. Rights activists have lobbied for his relocation since 2016.           AP   "
690,New York's Philharmonic takes to the streets,"

     Violinist Quan Ge (left) and violist Cong Wu of the New York Philharmonic play with their ""bandwagon's pop-up concert series"" at Betty Carter Park on Sept. 4 in New York City. [AFP/YONHAP]               Its fall season has been canceled and its concert hall closed indefinitely, so New York's Philharmonic is taking it to the streets.             One of America's oldest musical institutions, the famed symphony orchestra is playing outdoor pop-up shows, getting creative during the coronavirus pandemic that has kept concert halls closed and New Yorkers starved for live music.           Each weekend, small ensembles play at surprise locations throughout the city, wearing T-shirts and masks in front of a pickup truck dubbed the ""bandwagon.""           Sometimes musicians get rained on or people just walk on by — but sometimes a nearby delivery truck honks along in exactly the right key.           In those moments, says opera singer and series producer Anthony Roth Costanzo, ""it feels like the city is our orchestra and we're the soloists.""           ""In this moment of pandemic, in this moment of social change, we're exploring new ways together […] to connect to people and to realize that we have to reinvent the concert-going ritual,"" the countertenor told AFP after performing a set in Brooklyn's Betty Carter Park, a small leafy urban oasis above a subway track.           ""It's not just about bringing people into our house. It's about getting our house out in the world, and sharing what music can do.""           On a balmy Friday evening, Roth Costanzo and a string duet — Quan Ge on violin and Cong Wu on viola — drew a socially distanced crowd to their show that began with Mozart's Allegro in G Major and wrapped with the classic New York ballad ""Somewhere"" from ""West Side Story.""           Unlike at its traditional classical music concerts, the Philharmonic encourages its pop-up audiences to dance, applaud and interact between songs.           Roth Costanzo played the role of M.C., speaking to the crowd between each song from the bed of the pickup, at one point giving a shoutout to the vendor selling sheets and towels next to the makeshift stage.           Drivers slowed to roll down their windows and pedestrians took cell phone videos, as dozens of audience members — including children and dogs — stopped to take in the tunes that featured a string arrangement of Alicia Keys' ""Empire State of Mind.""           ""I love you!"" applauded one onlooker, Lorri, whose eyes welled with tears as Roth Costanzo finished a moving rendition of the somber ""Lachrimae Pavane."" ""It touched me,"" Lorri told AFP afterwards, calling the surprise concert ""heaven-sent.""           Like many musicians, members of the Philharmonic took their shows online when the spread of Covid-19 shut their doors in March. And while virtual concerts offered a stop-gap solution, they are simply ""not the same,"" said Cong.           ""Music is about communication,"" he said. ""We need the stage.""           Outdoors, he continued, ""it's nice to feel the energy from people — we play, we share the energy, and we have energy back from the audience.""           The Philharmonic isn't publicly announcing when and where each concert will occur, to avoid large crowds from amassing.           The organization is planning three performances a day on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays into at least mid-October, aiming to eventually cover all five city boroughs.              Violinist Quan Ge (left), violist Cong Wu (center) and countertenor/producer Anthony Roth Constanzo of the New York Philharmonic play with their ""bandwagon's pop-up concert series"" at Betty Carter Park, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. [AFP/YONHAP]               In each audience is the co-president of the League of Women Voters, who acts as a groupie of sorts, following the performers and helping those gathering to register to vote.           After Friday evening's mini concert wrapped at the park, where Brooklyn's Academy of Music towers across the street, Roth Costanzo called it ""gratifying"" to be back out performing live.           ""There was a moment at the end when the violins finished playing, and there was a perfect stillness, silence like you'd have in a concert hall,"" he said.           ""I can feel people connecting — it's not just me to them and them to me — it's them to each other as well.""           ""That's so important in our world right now.""           AFP   "
691,Purple Rain talks its latest album and losing its lead singer,"

     Band Purple Rain [ILGAN SPORTS]               Band Purple Rain, which gained widespread popularity after winning the KBS program “Immortal Songs” in March, has released its first regular album in hopes to provide some healing time for listeners.           The album “Wanderer Fantasy” by the group carries its desire for a miraculous change that can light up the world. All five members of the group participated in writing the music and lyrics or adjusting the tunes. The group was put together through JTBC’s program “Superband,” which had made many individual indie musicians team up with one another to show off their talents for the ultimate win. The group made it to the top 3 in the show aired last year.           After it released its first single “The King Must Die,” the group took part in “Immortal Song” in March for the first time and eventually took the win.           The main song off the album is “Miracle,” the lyrics and music of which was written by member Chae Bo-hun. The song is about hope and the desire to sing together. Chae is now serving his mandatory military duty.           The group sat down with Ilgan Sports, an affiliate of the Korea JoongAng Daily, to talk more about its first album. Below are edited excerpts.                 What does it feel like to have your first album released?       Gwang-hyeon: It isn’t easy to release a regular album as a band, but I’m so pleased that we made it happen.Ji-wan: The music we have worked on for so long has finally come out. It feels like I’m looking at a time capsule I buried before.Na-woo: It feels like we have made a project for Purple Rain season 1. I have met fellow members after doing the music all by myself and then met the management company. [The change] was confusing, but we all made so much effort to make an album that all of us are so satisfied with.               What’s the reason for naming your album “Wanderer Fantasy?""       Na-woo: The theme that covers the album is fantasy. Since all the songs in the album carry a variety of contents, we wanted to give it a name that could represent some free wanderer. “Behind the Curtain” is like music in the film with sounds coming from classic musical instruments. This song may show the deepest and darkest shades of the group. “New World” is brighter and hopeful. “Miracle” is the most rock song and fast paced.               All members participated in making the album. Who did what?       Ji-wan: I think we go beyond the idea that a certain member does certain things. Since “Superband,” I think each and every one of us understood what we need to do as a group. Ha-jin and I did overall producing as well as working on the musical instruments we needed to have. Na-woo checked the overall sound while Gwang-hyeon got his hands on rhythm as well as lyrics. Bo-hun did music arrangement.               When have you been happiest as a group?        Gwang-hyeon: I felt accomplished the moment we got the first single, as that is not only our first but also something that could show who we are very well.Na-woo: I’m so proud that we made an album all together.Ha-jin: I also say the album. We all had hard times while making it, and so many people have been waiting.Ji-wan: I think I felt accomplished when we performed on “Immortal Song” for the first time. I was thinking we understood each member better since “Superband,” and that performance was when we showed our charms as a team for the first time I think.               What is most important to you in terms of your music?       Ji-wan: It is quite difficult to elaborate with words, but I think we have made some kinds of guidelines as we work as Purple Rain.Gwang-hyeon: I think it is important whether the general public sees us as cool. I think looking cool upon first impression is something important.               How will you cope as a band until your vocalist Bo-hun gets discharged from the military?       Ha-jin: We are preparing a lot of interesting things. I think there will be a lot you have never expected to see from us.Na-woo: We will continue working as soloists and as fellow musicians together. We will prepare music until the day we all get together as a group again.                When are you the most energized?       Gwang-hyeon: I think the cheer from the fans when you are on stage really pumps you up. I think that’s why I do music.Na-woo: It feels like we are putting together pieces of a puzzle. As we work on making something together, we just have an abstract image of what the end result will be. When we have something good at the end, I think the ecstasy that comes with the result gives me power.               How would you define the music by Purple Rain?       Gwang-hyeon: It is like a musical.           BY KIM YEON-JI   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]   "

693,Typhoon Haishen expected to near Busan Monday,"

     Fierce waves batter the coast of Seogwipo, Jeju, on Sunday as Typhoon Haishen makes its way northwards into the East Sea. [YONHAP]               Fearing a recurrence of the damage wrought by Typhoon Maysak, Busan and South Gyeongsang remained on edge over the weekend as Typhoon Haishen was projected to skirt along the country's east coast after crossing the East Sea Monday.             According to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), Haishen was moving northwards in the Pacific Ocean, around 290 kilometers (180 miles) off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, at a speed of 22 kilometers per hour, as of Sunday morning.           While at first projected to make landfall in South Korea, the predicted course for the storm was adjusted Saturday. Haishen was expected to come within about 60 kilometers of its eastern coast near Pohang, North Gyeongsang, on Monday afternoon.             Cold and dry air prevailing northwest of the peninsula were likely to push the storm to the east as it nears Korea, the KMA said, following its northward course across the west coast of the Japanese island of Kyushu on Monday morning.          After passing through the East Sea between the Korean mainland and Ulleung Island and the Dokdo islets, Haishen was projected to make landfall in North Korea’s North Hamgyong Province on Wednesday afternoon, with its intensity substantially reduced at that point.          The storm was nonetheless projected to lash Korea’s eastern coast with heavy rains and fierce winds, with areas adjacent to its path receiving up to 400 millimeters (15.7 inches) of precipitation throughout Monday.           The storm's classification was downgraded Sunday from “super strong” to “very strong” after the sustained wind speed at its center dropped from 56 meters per second to 49 meters per second.              The typhoon — the 10th to form this year — had a pressure of around 925 hectopascals at its center.          North and South Gyeongsang were due to receive around 100 to 300 millimeters of rain, North and South Jeolla between 100 to 200 millimeters and the rest of the country somewhere between 50 and 100 millimeters.             Winds were projected to reach speeds of up to 40 meters per second (89 miles per hour) in southeastern Korea and the eastern part of Gangwon, strong enough to knock an adult off his or her feet.                Hundreds of fishing vessels are docked in Seogwipo harbor in Jeju on Sunday due to the approach of Typhoon Haishen. [YONHAP]               Coastal areas along the East Sea and the Korea Strait were also at risk of flooding from the storm surge, as the typhoon's arrival near Korea was due to coincide with the high tide, the KMA warned. This, combined with the low atmospheric pressure, could cause sea levels to rise a meter above average, said an agency spokesperson.           Recovery efforts in the aftermath of Typhoon Maysak had barely begun in Busan when the city was again plunged into high alert this weekend due to concerns over Haishen.           Officials were dispatched to inspect the city’s 59 drain pumping areas, as well as areas vulnerable to flooding. Objects like outdoor signs, trees, traffic lights and street lamps that could be knocked over with strong winds were also subject to inspection.             The KMA’s Busan branch said Haishen was projected to come nearest to the city at around 9 a.m. on Monday, with its center hovering over waters some 80 kilometers southeast of Busan.          Maysak, which tore through southeastern Korea last week, indirectly killed two people and left a host of damage in its wake. Around 75,000 households experienced varying degrees of blackouts, while evacuations forced around 2,800 people from their homes.             The storm ultimately left 58 people homeless after their residences were destroyed by the storm.             With Haishen holding the potential to wreak even further damage to devastated areas, the Korean government’s Central Disaster Management Headquarters on Sunday raised the country’s typhoon alert to its second highest level.             The KMA also warned that the storm’s projected course could again change as it moved north through the coast of Japan on Sunday evening.             BY SHIM KYU-SEOK   [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]               "
694,[TURNING 20] Beyond the evidence — how profilers help solve crimes ,"

     Profiler Pyo Chang-won sat down with the Korea JoongAng Daily for an interview to discuss how the role of profiler has changed in the past 20 years. [PARK SANG-MOON]         Compared to other developed countries like the United States where criminal profilers’ knowledge and skills have played a significant role in solving serious crimes for nearly 50 years, Korean profilers have been working relatively in the shadows of the country’s criminal investigations.           It was only recently that profilers here were openly given credit as they played a critical role in getting a confession from serial killer Lee Chun-jae. Lee is a high profile criminal who made headlines last year by admitting that he is the man behind the notorious Hwaseong serial murders, the country’s most brutal rape and murder case that had remained unsolved for decades. The crimes took place between 1986 and 1991 and a total of 10 women were raped before being brutally murdered. The case was even made into a movie by director Bong Joon-ho, titled “Memories of Murder” (2003).           After a lengthy battle of wits between profilers and Lee, he finally confessed that he was responsible for 14 murders including the 10 that took place in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi.            The case had remained unsolved until last year when police identified Lee as a prime suspect after finding DNA samples from the victim’s clothes matched samples from Lee, which had been kept securely in the national DNA database for many years.           Despite the mounting evidence against him, Lee refused to talk. But profilers persisted and continuously tried to build rapport with the serial killer.            Local media praised the profilers who were involved in solving the Hwaseong case, acknowledging that they played a key role in solving this notorious crime by reading Lee’s mind and targeting his psychological weaknesses to make him confess.              Profiler Pyo Chang-won in a SBS investigative program ’Unanswered Questions“ episode dealing with serial killer Lee Chun-jae. [UNANSWERED QUESTIONS]         Although Korea’s profilers and their roles only recently were brought to the limelight, it has been 20 years since the Seoul Metropolitan Police officially introduced profiling investigation techniques to the country. After establishing the Scientific Investigation Unit within the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in February 2000, profilers’ voices finally became heard, signaling a great advancement in the country's investigations of serious criminal offenses.             Profiler Pyo Chang-won, who was also a ruling Democratic Party lawmaker from 2016 to May 2020, was one of the first criminal profilers in the country, who made great contributions to solving some of the most high profile cases in Korea.           The Korea JoongAng Daily sat down with Pyo, 54, for an interview to discuss how the role of profiler has changed in the past 20 years and how it is viewed as a profession by Korean society. The following are edited excerpts.               Q. The criminal profiling technique was adopted in the United States when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established the Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) in 1972 to investigate serial killers. How was it introduced in Korea?            A. In the United States, this method was first introduced when the serial killer Ted Bundy killed more than 30 women throughout the 1970s. Before him, motives for murder always fell within four categories: money, love, revenge or drugs. Most cases could be solved by the basic principle of forensic science as “every contact leaves a trace.” But Ted Bundy had nothing to do with the victim nor did he leave any trace at the scene. When the police finally caught him, the police were shocked because Ted Bundy was far from being the prime suspect. Then they realized that to make psychopathic criminals like Ted Bundy one of the main suspects, they needed to collaborate with psychologists and psychiatrists who study abnormal behavior and human impulses. That's how the BSU was established in the United States.           In the case of Korea, it was not until the 1990s when we faced serial murder cases like the Jijonpa gang of thugs that made headlines by kidnapping and killing “rich people,” and the Makgapa gang who were burying victims alive and eating human flesh. At that time, the National Police Agency was preoccupied with improving scientific investigation techniques in Korea. That was also important, of course, but we had to find ways to get down to these serial killers, especially those who don't leave much evidence for scientific investigation at the scene.           We needed to at least get the basic outline of the suspect to start the investigation, but how could we, if the criminal never had a face-to-face encounter with the victim? Or if they weren't a previous offender with a motive? Or what if they weren’t among the probable suspects living around the area? At that point, we were stuck. That’s when we found out that profiling techniques could help the investigation by identifying the suspect's abnormal psychology and their characteristics marked at the scene.               Q. When did you decide to become a criminal profiler?            A. After graduating from Korean National Police University, I started as a police inspector investigating criminal cases. But when I couldn’t contribute to solving the case of the Hwaseong serial murder case, nor find a clue when the national college entrance exam paper was stolen in 1992, I felt ashamed of myself. I wondered what I could do to improve my investigative skills, and that’s when I decided to go and study abroad in 1993. At that time, I had never even heard of profilers. I just wanted to get better investigation training outside Korea.           After getting my Master's and Ph.D. in police studies at the University of Exeter in England, I returned to Korea in 1998. That’s when Detective Kwon Il-yong and I established a research group called the Forensic Identification Research Society with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's scientific investigation team. It wasn’t an official organization where we received funding from the government, but detectives, forensic experts and criminal psychology professors gathered voluntarily to discuss and analyze unresolved cases. While detective Kwon constantly urged that our National Police Agency should introduce a behavioral science unit, Busan was haunted by a serial killer, Jeong Du-yeong, from 1999 to 2000. After Jeong’s case, the National Police Agency agreed to officially begin hiring profilers in 2000.               Q. How has society’s perception of criminal profilers changed over the past 20 years?           A. There was a turbulent period in the beginning years. The National Police Agency hired psychology and sociology degree holders through tests, trained them to become police officers and gave them senior policemen rank as criminal profilers. In the first year, we hired 15 of them and sent each to a local police station.       But, unfortunately, the local police stations were not on the same page as the National Police Agency. To local police officers, profilers were not welcome at all. To them, a complete stranger, who were mostly women and who weren't even police officers before, suddenly came in with a senior police rank. So the detectives were like: Who are you guys? Have you ever handled dead bodies at the scene? Do you know the smell of blood? Have you ever been through a rough investigation? How are you going to investigate by just reading textbooks?           One episode that I recall is that the criminal division chief in a local police station sent the profiler to the murder scene on the first day of work and said, “Hey, you said you were a profiler. Now, tell me who did it. Shouldn’t you know who did it by reading the scene?” Being the first time she visited the crime scene, she couldn't say anything. Without letting her adapt to the crime scenes, the chief never let her come to other crime scenes again nor let her take part in future investigations. But such attitude was common in the beginning years, and many profilers left because of that.           But for those who managed to adapt, profiling slowly began to rise in status by contributing to solving cases. Now, detectives go to profilers when they are stuck in the middle of investigations like when they are having a hard time identifying suspects, or when their arrested suspect won’t talk. Most of the cases that come to profilers are high profile crimes like serial murders. Profilers can build rapport with criminals and make them talk about why they committed the crime, what they were thinking, what they did.               Q. What would you say about the career outlook for criminal profilers?          A. To be honest, I am on the fence about it. As of now, the guaranteed spots are extremely limited. For example, there is a certain number of open positions for doctors each year in Korea, but that is not the case for criminal profilers. It depends solely on one's capability in solving the case whether one can succeed as a criminal profiler who even appears on TV shows or someone who never gets a case from the police.           But in the long term, profilers hold a greater potential. Not only from police officers but also other public sectors. Military investigation officers and the National Intelligence Service officers are starting to recognize profilers' capability and are making inquiries. In the private sector, insurance companies call profilers to detect insurance fraud, and conglomerates call profilers when involved in industrial espionage or embezzlement cases. Profilers have considerable usefulness in preventing or reducing such risk factors.                 Q. So after being a criminal profiler for the past 20 years, what do you see for yourself for the next 20 years?           A. Won’t I still be appearing in TV shows? Recently, I started hosting JTBC’s investigative program “Crime Chief” from July that runs every weekday. Each day we have different corners. For example, on Mondays we have a corner named “epidemiological study in crimes.” Just like we investigate the origins of the infection and the spread of Covid-19, we try to find the fundamental cause of a crime in a way to prevent the recurrence of the same crime. I also wish that the Pyo Institute of Crime Science [PICS] will have grown bigger by then. Right now I can’t afford to hire anyone, but by that time I wish I could hire and train profilers who wish to investigate crimes and conduct research on crime prevention.              Pyo Institute of Crime Science’s CIS & Profiling one-day class program. [PYO INSTITUTE OF CRIME SCIENCE]             Q. Speaking of PICS, its website introduces the institute as “a scene where you strive to realize the dream of becoming ‘Korean Sherlock Holmes.’"" Would you call yourself the Korean Sherlock Holmes?          A. Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective, who provides advice to police at the crime scene. Everyone can be a consultant. I was a consultant to the SBS investigative program “Unanswered Questions,” and have been consulting reporters just like we are doing right now. Sherlock Holmes is also cultural content as a fictional character. PICS is a civilian research and training lab which provides educational programs to teach criminal investigation techniques and prevent crimes. This can also be defined as cultural content in a modern sense.                ""Serial Murder Cases in Korea"" (translated) written by profiler Pyo Chang-won.   Q. You've already written nearly 20 books. Do you plan on writing more?          A. I am writing a mystery novel that’s an easy read. The publishing companies want me to write a book that analyzes criminal cases, but that work is just too painful. By that, I’m not referring to physical pain but emotional pain. I would have to look back on the actual cases and be able to retell the painful stories to the public. In the process, it may unintentionally add wounds to the bereaved families and victims. It is just too emotionally difficult to go back into the minds of criminals.           Recently, readers' standards have risen considerably through investigative TV programs like ""Unanswered Questions"" or crime dramas like ""CSI” and “Criminal Minds.” In the United States and Europe, many former profilers, former detectives, former lawyers and former judges write mystery novels. Based on their factual and investigative techniques, their novels are very realistic.           On the other hand, Korean mystery authors may have great storytelling techniques, but they are weak in elaborating on the details of the crime scene. Without having detailed knowledge in investigative techniques, mystery novel authors alone cannot appeal to these readers. So wouldn't it be a great contribution if I write a mystery novel based on my profiling techniques? I am writing rough drafts over and over, but it’s going to take some time because I would never want to publish something embarrassing (laughs).           BY KIM YEON-AH   [kim.yeonah@joongang.co.kr]   "

     Son Heung-min is seen wearing the captain's armband in this Tottenham Hotspur match announcement. [SCREEN CAPTURE]               Son Heung-min of Tottenham Hotspur finished his preseason campaign strong.           During Spurs’ last friendly against Watford at Vicarago Road Stadium in Watford on Saturday, Son scored his fourth goal of the preseason friendlies. While Spurs were losing 2-0, Son scored a late penalty in the 79th minute to prevent the team from suffering a shutout loss.            Despite Son’s goal, Spurs still lost the match 1-2.            Following the game against Watford, the club ended their preseason friendlies with a record of three wins and a loss. In addition to scoring his fourth goal, this was a meaningful match for Son as he wore the captain’s armband for the first time since joining Spurs five years ago.            Son was named captain as a number of Spurs’ senior players like goalkeeper Hugon Lloris and Harry Kane were absent with the England national team at the UEFA Nations League.            Son's momentum hasn't faltered throughout the friendlies. He started off by scoring two goals during Spurs’ first friendly match against Ipswich Town on Aug. 22.           Then, against Reading on Aug. 28, Son scored another in the 39th minute to help Spurs pick up a 4-1 victory in their second friendly. Not only was Son able to score in two straight matches, but his goal against Reading marked the fifth anniversary of the day he signed with Spurs.           Son was back in action in Spurs’ third friendly against Birmingham on Aug. 29. Spurs won the match 1-0, although Son didn't score.           Spurs will officially start their 2020-21 Premier league season with a match against Everton on Sunday, Sept. 13, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.            Elsewhere in Europe, Lee Kang-in of Valencia CF also set high expectations for the upcoming 2020-21 season.            During a friendly against FC Cartagena, Lee scored two goals — an equalizer in the 69th minute and another in the 80th minute — to help Valencia pick up a 3-1 victory.            Valencia will start their 2020-21 La Liga season with a match against Levante UD on Sunday, Sept. 13, at Mestalla Stadium.           BY KANG YOO-RIM   [kang.yoorim@joongang.co.kr]   "

      Logos of Disney Plus and film studios. [JOONGANG PHOTO]               Any 5-year-old can tell you why all major Korean mobile companies are scrambling to partner with Disney to stream Disney Plus: ""Frozen.""             If that's not enough, the service has 8,000 other titles, some of which are classics of the big screen or small — from ""The Simpsons"" to ""Star Wars"" — that any competitive internet company needs to have on its side.             It’s been less than a year since Disney Plus was first introduced in the global market. By the second quarter, the service had 60.5 million subscribers.           SK Telecom, LG U+ and KT have been vying to work with the Burbank, California-based company to bring Disney Plus to Korea. The stakes are high, and each has its own motivation to get a deal done.           SK Telecom, which is the only of the three that did not partner with Netflix, is in need of a win and has been actively and enthusiastically participating in negotiations. LG U+ has been offering the most favorable conditions, while KT, the largest in the domestic paid TV market, needs to ink a deal if it is to guarantee its lead.             Disney Plus has not chosen a partner and has not even indicated whether it will just choose one or whether it will supply programming to all three.           Netflix weighs heavy on negotiations. The streaming service, which has 192 million subscribers worldwide, entered the market four years ago and has dominated it.           Since LG U+ teamed up with Netflix in 2018, its paid subscriber numbers are up 12 percent. After losing customers to LG U+ following the availability of Netflix, KT signed with the Los Gatos, California-based streaming leader.           Disney Plus is expected to out-Netflix Netflix and become the dominant streaming service in the Korean market.           It has access to the libraries of Walt Disney Company, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, 21st Century Fox and National Geographic, and 47 of the top 100 top-grossing U.S. films of all time, such as the “Avengers” series, “Avatar” and “Titanic.”           The Disney Plus basic plan in the United States is set at $6.99 monthly and $69.9 yearly. It is cheaper than Netflix, which costs about $12.99 monthly.             Facing these powerful companies from overseas, the Korean government has suggested domestic players combine forces and establish a single platform instead of competing against one another.             Korea Communications Commission (KCC) Chairman Han Sang-hyuk last month sat down with representatives of four local platforms — Watcha, Wavve, CJ ENM’s Tving and KT’s Seezn — urging cooperation.           During the meeting, Han emphasized that with foreign platforms establishing a strong presence in the domestic market, ""cooperation among local companies is strongly needed.”             The domestic companies showed little interest, and academics say that a unified front is probably the wrong approach.           Even if they cooperate, it doesn't mean they can beat the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus, Professor Cho Myeong-hyeon, who teaches business at Korea University, said. The government should allow mergers and acquisitions to happen naturally while supporting the local companies with tax benefits or direct financial assistance, the professor added.             BY PARK HYUNG-SOO   [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]   "

699,Level 2.5 distancing rules extended for greater Seoul,"

     Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo announces Friday that the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi will be extended for another week. [YONHAP]          Health authorities announced Friday that the so-called Level 2.5 social distancing measures for Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi will be extended for another week until Sept. 13, while Level 2 measures for the entire nation will be extended for two more weeks to Sept. 20.           That means Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi — together called the Seoul metropolitan area or the greater Seoul area — will fall under both Level 2 and 2.5 measures until Sept. 13.             Level 2.5 won’t look entirely the same as over the past week either. Health authorities added a few more restrictions.             Starting Monday, bakery, ice cream and bingsu (shaved ice dessert) chains can’t allow their customers to eat or drink inside the establishments at any time; only takeout orders and deliveries are allowed. The restrictions are the same as currently applied to coffee chains.             Some 671 vocational training institutes in the Seoul metropolitan area have to shut down as well and offer online courses only.             Churches in the greater Seoul area will remain closed until Sept. 20, during which they can only offer online services. Churches outside the greater Seoul area can offer offline services, but local government offices will have the authority to decide whether to strengthen restrictions for religious communities within their jurisdiction, the central government said.           Other rules in the Level 2.5 system are the same.           Restaurants, bars as well as standalone coffee shops and bakeries can offer normal services — or allow customers to eat and drink inside the stores — until 9 p.m., after which they can only provide takeout until 5 a.m.           All indoor sports facilities, indoor golf practicing ranges and billiard halls will remain shut, and so will day care centers. Hagwon, or private cram schools, with 10 people or more can hold online classes only. Visits to nursing hospitals and nursing facilities for the elderly are banned as well.           Most schools also saw their social distancing measures extended Friday.           In the greater Seoul area, all students in kindergarten through middle school will remain home and engage in online learning until Sept. 20. High schools will run up to a third of their total capacity.           Outside the Seoul metropolitan area, kindergarten through middle school can run up to a third of their total capacity, while high schools can run up to two-thirds.           The extensions were announced hours after health officials said 198 new cases of the coronavirus were counted nationwide Thursday, slightly up from 195 cases the previous day. It was the second time in nearly three weeks that daily infections were below 200. Most of last week saw over 300 cases daily, including a recent peak on Aug. 26 of 441.             Minister of Health and Welfare Park Neung-hoo said in a Friday afternoon press briefing that while it was a “relief” that Korea managed to stay below 200 new infections for two straight days, measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus should be maintained nationwide.             The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters said in a press release that the greater Seoul area was still seeing over 100 new cases a day, while nationwide, health officials weren’t sure how more than 20 percent of recently diagnosed patients got infected, which raises the odds of unexplained transmissions.           Among Thursday’s total infections, 189 were local cases and nine were imported.           Of the local cases, 68 were detected in Seoul, 55 in Gyeonggi, 20 in South Chungcheong, 10 in Gwangju, seven in Daegu, five in Incheon, four each in North Chungcheong and North Gyeongsang, three each in Busan, Daejeon, Ulsan, Gangwon and South Gyeongsang, and one in South Jeolla.           Sejong City, North Jeolla and Jeju Island saw zero new cases.             Out of the imported cases, two were from Russia and one each from Turkey, France, the United States, Brazil and Ethiopia.             Two people died, bringing total deaths to 331, while 254 people recovered, bringing total recoveries to 15,783.           As of Thursday at midnight, Korea had counted 20,842 Covid-19 patients in all.             BY LEE SUNG-EUN   [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]    "

                           A Lotte Mart branch. Lotte Shopping plans to close 16 Lotte Mart branches within this year. [LOTTE SHOPPING]                Discount chains are shutting down branches as their sales dip from the Covid-19 crisis.           Lotte Shopping, operator of Lotte Mart stores, announced Friday it is shutting down stores in Guro District, western Seoul, and at an Icheon expressway rest area in Gyeonggi. Its big-box store Big Market in Dobong District, northern Seoul, is also shutting down.           Lotte Shopping explained Friday how staff will be reassigned from those branches and a compensation plan for store owners who rent space inside the branches.           The branches in Guro and Dobong will operate until Nov. 30, while the one in the expressway rest area will wrap up business on Sept. 30.           Lotte Shopping, which also operates Lotte Department Stores and Lotte Hi-Marts, had earlier announced it would close 16 Lotte Mart branches by the end of this year, as brick-and-mortar sales continue to remain sluggish due to the coronavirus crisis.           Lotte Shopping has 700 branches in Korea.           Homeplus announced on Thursday it is closing its branch in Daejeon, the third closure announced this year.

702,"99 percent debt-to-GDP ratio by 2045, ministry predicts","

                        Korea's debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at 99 percent in 2045, the Ministry of Economy and Finance predicts, though the government plans to get that number down to 60 percent by 2060 with big state projects, such as the Green New Deal.           The Finance Ministry on Wednesday released a long-term fiscal outlook report for the first time since 2015.             According to the Korean Statistical Information Service (Kosis), Korea’s debt-to-GDP ratio as of 2019 was 38.1 percent.           The report states that if the current rates of decline in population and GDP growth rate continue, the ratio will keep rising and peak as high as 99 percent in 2045. The projection is based on the premise that the real growth rate drops to 0.5 percent by 2050. Under this scenario, the population is projected to fall by 8.94 million by 2060, and the working age population by 16.78 million.             After the peak, the debt ratio is expected to fall to the 65-81 percent range.           In a better-case scenario assuming a smaller economic downturn and a slowing in the population decline, the projected debt-to-GDP ratio is not much different. The value is expected to increase to the 84-97 percent level by 2044 before it begins to decline.           “Up to mid-2040, the rate of increase for national debt will outpace GDP growth rate. After 2040, the government expenses will decrease, and the debt-to-GDP ratio will also go down,” said Na Ju-bum, the director of the fiscal innovation bureau under the Finance Ministry.           The government’s objective is to take the debt-to-GDP ratio level to 60 percent by 2060 by slowing the economic downturn through initiatives such as the Korean New Deal. This blueprint is criticized for being overly optimistic.           In 2015, the projected debt-to-GDP ratio for 2060 was between 38.1 and 62.4 percent. The government’s National Financial Management Plan for the 2020 to 2024 period states that the debt-to-GDP ratio will hit 58.3 percent as early as 2024. The projected debt-to-GDP ratio stated in the long-term fiscal outlook announced at the end of 2018 was 65.6 percent for 2040 and 85.6 percent for 2050.               “Although the coronavirus outbreak is a special circumstance, if the current level of government spending continues, the growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is already at a dangerous state, will be difficult to curb,” said Ahn Chang-nam, a tax economics professor at Gangnam University. “The prospect that the ratio will fall after 2040 is not a very realistic view.”           “If the government wants to manage the debt-to-GDP ratio to reach its objective, then there needs to be a strong fiscal rule guarded by the law, so that it is not affected by politics,” said Choi Won-seok, a taxation professor at the University of Seoul.           The future of social insurance is dim. If the current policies and economic conditions persist, the national pension will be in deficit in 2041 and be exhausted by 2056. Compared to earlier projections in 2015, the expiry point has moved up by four years.           Regarding welfare, the government stated in the long-term fiscal outlook that social insurance reform is needed, as the current insurance and pension system lacks sustainability in the age of changing demographics.             BY HA NAM-HYUN, LEE JEE-YOUNG   [lee.jeeyoung1@joongang.co.kr]                                 "
703,In a grave in Gyeongju a pair of shoes tell their own story ,"

     A set of earrings found from Hwangnamdong Tumulus 120-2 in Gyeongju. [YONHAP]               The plethora of luxurious accessories, buried underground for some 1,500 years, is the main clue that this person buried in a grave in Gyeongju either belonged to a royal family or was a prestigious aristocrat.            While the body has decayed, a gilt-bronze coronet with gold earrings, a silver belt, a silver bracelet and silver ring have not. Gilt bronze shoes remain where the feet would have been.           This excavation began in May when a pair of golden shoes were discovered, the 13th of their kind from a grave from Silla Dynasty (57 B.C. to A.D. 935).            From Hwangnamdong Tumulus No. 120-2, all kinds of accessories that are believed to be from the sixth century were discovered. The location of the accessories indicates that all of them were worn by the person that was being buried.            It is the first time since the excavation of Hwangnam Daechong, from 1973 to 1975, that a collection of different jewelry and accessories has been found all together at the same time at the grave in the Gyeongju area. It is also the first time to find a body that was apparently buried while wearing shoes.               A gilt-bronze shoe. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION OF KOREA]               “Since May, we have conducted a detailed investigation on [the area] and we found [women’s] earrings where it seemed ears must have been located,” said Kim Kwon-il, senior researcher of Foundation of Silla Cultural Heritage Research Institute. He also added that previous finds from the grave like a bronze iron or loops to a spinning wheel adds to the likelihood that the deceased was a woman.           Professor Lee Han-sang of Daejeon University who majored in accessories, also believes the person is a woman because no large sword was found, unlike in the graves of men. Instead, small decorative knives were found around the waist, which he takes as a woman's.              The fact that there was a gilt-bronze coronet means that this person used to have a high social status. The coronet is very flamboyant and features carved decorative patterns.           It is the first time for a coronet to be found with some decorative holes, the investigative team said. The shape of this coronet has never been seen before and there is a need for further investigation to see if this hat is a decorative item, or an item that signals the social position the buried had held.           At the sides of the silver belt were silver bracelets. It seems like the deceased also wore beaded bracelets given that more than 500 beads, measuring about 1 millimeter (0.04 inches), were found.            Five silver rings were found on the right hand while one was found on the left. It is said there’s a possibility that more silver rings will be excavated if the team goes further with its investigation. This means there is a chance that the buried wore a ring per finger.              Findings from Hwawngnamdong Tumulus No. 120-2. [CULTURAL HERITAGE ADMINISTRATION OF KOREA]               It is the first time to find shoes that appear to have been on the body when it was buried. Until now, all the gilt-bronze shoes that were found in graves were placed next to the buried. The shoes have some decorative patterns punched on the front, while the backs are plain.            The Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA) said there was a similar shoe excavated from a grave in Uiseong in 1960. It added that such shoes weren’t something worn for daily use, but made for a ritual to send off the deceased.           The height of the deceased is thought to be about 170 centimeters (67 inches) given that the length between the middle of the coronet to the heel of the shoes is about 176 centimeters.           Researcher Lee Hyun-tae of a team that studies the recovery of artifacts and heritage from Silla under CHA also added his opinion that, from his archaeological background, the buried is a tall woman — although there is no absolute confirmation of the gender and height because no bones have been found.           He added that the average height of the people from Silla is still unknown, but it can be speculated that this person was exceptionally tall.           The study to investigate Hwangnamdong Tumulus No. 120 started in 2018. CHA joined hands with the regional government of North Gyeongsang as well as the city of Gyeongju to recover and clean up the major heritage of the Silla kingdom. They had confirmed the traces of grave 120-1, north of 120, and grave 120-2, south of 120.           “We will continue to do more scientific analysis to find traces of human bones, and to find out more about the social status and the gender of the buried,” said CHA.           The administration showed a variety of accessories it found online through its YouTube channel last week and answered questions.           In a way to share the newly found information and cultural heritage with the general public, the investigative team will continue using the online outlet to give real-time updates about the excavation site from now on.             BY KANG HYE-RAN, LEE SUN-MIN   [summerlee@joongang.co.kr]         "
704,Doctors agree to call off strikes,"

     President Choi Dae-zip of the KMA, left, and Rep. Han Jeoung-ae, chief policymaker of the Democratic Party (DP), sign an agreement on Friday.  [YONHAP]                Doctors said Friday they will end the strike in return for the ruling party’s promise to stop its plan to increase the number of medical students and open a new medical school for public health specialists while Korea battles Covid-19.           Leaders of the Korea Medical Association (KMA) and the ruling Democratic Party (DP) signed an agreement in the morning at the party’s headquarters building in Yeouido, western Seoul. Based on the deal, the KMA said doctors will end their walkouts, which started on Aug. 21.             President Choi Dae-zip of the KMA and Rep. Han Jeoung-ae, chief policymaker of the DP, signed a five-point agreement. DP Chairman Lee Nak-yon also attended the meeting to ensure the ruling party’s commitment.             The two sides agreed to cooperate to resolve problems such as the shortage of medical services in rural areas and outdated medical education and trainee programs. They also agreed to work together to overcome the Covid-19 crisis.             According to the agreement, the two sides agreed that the DP will not make any attempt to push forward plans to increase the number of medical students and open a new medical school for public health doctors until the outbreak subsides.            When the discussion resumes in the future, the ruling party agreed to form a consultative body that includes members of the medical community to listen to doctors’ opinions. The talks will start from square one, instead of modifying the current plans, the DP and the KMA agreed.             The DP also agreed that it will not wield its majority in the legislature and pass any related bills while the talks are taking place.             Doctors started to strike on Aug. 21 after the DP and Ministry of Health and Welfare announced medical reform plans.          The DP and the government announced on July 23 plans to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 in the next 10 years and to open a new medical school to train doctors as public health authorities. The KMA protested the plans, saying the country already has an oversupply of medical professionals.             According to the agreement announced Friday, the DP and the KMA agreed that budgets will be allocated to improve services at public health institutions. The DP also agreed to listen to the demands of the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) to improve working conditions.             The two sides agreed that assistance will be given to doctors and medical institutions to overcome the current coronavirus crisis.             The DP and the KMA struck the deal after an overnight negotiation. “Because the government [and the ruling party] had pushed forward the plans unilaterally since July, 140,000 members of the KMA had to go through turmoil,” Choi said. “We could have avoided this chaos in our society if the government and the ruling party had enough consultations with the KMA in advance.”             The DP also said it will ask the government to scrap its plan to prosecute 10 doctors who participated in the strike.  Later in the afternoon, the KMA and the Ministry of Health and Welfare signed a similar agreement.           BY SER MYO-JA   [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]           "
